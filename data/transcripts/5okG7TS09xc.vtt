00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:53.210 align:start position:0%

representative Terry okay I'll I'll
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
report out okay yeah
 
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
um it's not recommended for future
 
00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
legislation that is correct uh the
 
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
definition of a convenience store is a
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
store with extended operating hours and
 
00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:11.339 align:start position:0%
in a convenient location uh stocking a
 
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
limited range of household goods
 
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
groceries including beer and wine the
 
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
Bill's intention was to allow less than
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
a three thousand dollar inventory of
 
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
food items this bill is not recommended
 
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
because according to their lobbyists the
 
00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:24.779 align:start position:0%
store owners do not have an issue with
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
the three thousand dollar inventory of
 
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
food and products the liquor enforcement
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
and Licensing Division of the liquid
 
00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:32.459 align:start position:0%
commission agreed to make rule changes
 
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
if needed to fine-tune the food product
 
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.509 align:start position:0%
if needed to fine-tune the food product
lists

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
lists
 
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
right and I think that's important I
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
think that well I would be sponsoring
 
00:10:41.889 --> 00:10:41.899 align:start position:0%
legislation for next year too to
 
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
modernize the language
 
00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
at least enough to I have to do it for
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
my wife because she does not like canned
 
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
vegetables who does not believe that's a
 
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
food product
 
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
so we need to clean that up that's a
 
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.170 align:start position:0%
so we need to clean that up that's a
vegetable

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
vegetable
 
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.490 align:start position:0%
vegetable
so

00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500 align:start position:0%

okay I'm glad you're here
 
00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:43.019 align:start position:0%
all right uh House Bill 343 relative to
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
building for ambulance services I assume
 
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
that's representative Weston and moose
 
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:49.820 align:start position:0%
not recommended for future legislation
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
uh we do recommend this for future
 
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
legislation we do yes my motion is to
 
00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation and uh
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
there is considerable need to
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
um uh to do something about this issue
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
of reimbursing rural ambulance services
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
the bill that we have right now does not
 
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
fit the bill it's too complex but we do
 
00:15:16.009 --> 00:15:16.019 align:start position:0%
hope that in next year there will be a
 
00:15:17.329 --> 00:15:17.339 align:start position:0%
study committee with all the
 
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
stakeholders at the table to consider
 
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
further legislation to deal with this
 
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
issue the issue still exists it has not
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
gone away no I understand that but but I
 
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
think the idea was that the bill in its
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
current form
 
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
is not recommended for future
 
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.829 align:start position:0%
is not recommended for future
legislation

00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
so that yes anything that comes that
 
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
that uh bill because we'll have other
 
00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:43.019 align:start position:0%
bills that I I think that I will be
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
sponsoring bills next year but I'm just
 
00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
saying we don't recommend this bill in
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
this term specifically this specific
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
bill in its current form and its current
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
form is that all right with you Ania
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
yes and
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
um representative ham and I are going to
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
be working together yeah and putting all
 
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
the exactly exactly yeah so it's just
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
just this bill in its current form but
 
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:07.019 align:start position:0%
then in the blurb if you want to write
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
it or if you want to write it say you're
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
going to put in legislation for next
 
00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:14.339 align:start position:0%
year that will uh be light you know that
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
would try to focus in on on the primary
 
00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.829 align:start position:0%
would try to focus in on on the primary
issue

00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
put it in um this coming year it will be
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
you were going to do a study you're
 
00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:25.019 align:start position:0%
right okay you can write that in the
 
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
book okay is that okay okay
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
understanding that situation then I say
 
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
it's not recommended for future thank
 
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.829 align:start position:0%
it's not recommended for future thank
you

00:16:32.829 --> 00:16:32.839 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
and you can write the book is it is that
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:47.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
no Burrows she's ready to blurb right so
 
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:58.129 --> 00:16:58.139 align:start position:0%
that we don't care about yeah
 
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson so I I heard you
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
say this last week but I disagree with
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
the interpretation of the rules that
 
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
when we recommend for future legislation
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
we're not saying that last year's bill
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
was was appropriate or well written or
 
00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:17.579 align:start position:0%
on on any issue
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
um or that last year's bill was correct
 
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
the reason that I voted earlier this
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
year to hold bills uh for this meeting
 
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
was that there was something wrong with
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
the bill but that there was still an
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
issue that needed to be dealt with when
 
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
I say recommend for future legislation I
 
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
I don't mean that a specific exact Bill
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
the only purpose of this meeting is
 
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
whether or not to continue taking that
 
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
issue forward and I think that the
 
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
balance billing issue is an issue and I
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
think that future legislation is needed
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
fair enough okay uh
 
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion is not recommended
 
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
for future Regis legislation now the
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative petusic yes
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative boehm yes
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
the clerk votes yes representative
 
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.190 align:start position:0%
the clerk votes yes representative
Abramson

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
representative ham
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet yes
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%

representative Bartlett
 
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.650 align:start position:0%
representative Bartlett
yes

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert yes
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative Van Houten yes
 
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
representative Weston yes
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative bellew yes
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs yes
 
00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:45.299 align:start position:0%
representative McAleer yes
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt yes 15-1 or is it 16 now
 
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
the first the first one I did was off by
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
one okay
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
all right moving on uh next up is HB 416
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
allowing hobby distillation of Liquors
 
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
uh representative petusic moves not
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation and
 
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative recognized to speak to
 
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
um HB 416 uh allowing the hobby
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
distillation of Liquors the majority of
 
00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:27.299 align:start position:0%
this committee has voted not to
 
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
recommend further action on this matter
 
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
according to U.S code the hobby
 
00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
distillation of alcohol is still
 
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
primarily a federal matter
 
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
it is therefore a moot point whether or
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
not the state of New Hampshire permits
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
it or not it is still a federally
 
00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:42.299 align:start position:0%
controlled substance
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
no okay any more discussion on the
 
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
motion of not recommended for future
 
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.210 align:start position:0%
motion of not recommended for future
legislation

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
yes represent just on the principle so I
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
recall this after we had our meeting
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
last week just on the principle of when
 
00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:00.539 align:start position:0%
you have a federal law that says that
 
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
you can't do something and then you also
 
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
have an overlapping state law that says
 
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
that you can't do something if it's our
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
intent to let the federal government
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
handle it then we should remove repeal
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
the state law in my opinion and and
 
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.070 align:start position:0%
the state law in my opinion and and
secondly

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.270 align:start position:0%
secondly
um

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
the reason for the other reason for
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
doing that is
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
um that the sponsors said that we needed
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
to have more States send a message that
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
we didn't want the federal government to
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
ban hobby distillation of spirits or
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
whatever the issue is
 
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
um I I I see that there's a law in place
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
and that law should be removed the state
 
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
law should be removed because it doesn't
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
make sense to have both the state and
 
00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
the federal government duplicating
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
something it also doesn't make sense to
 
00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:45.299 align:start position:0%
say that we're just going to wait until
 
00:20:47.049 --> 00:20:47.059 align:start position:0%
the federal government removes a rule
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
before we do so because it's it's
 
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
another you know year or two years to
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
get through the legislative process to
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
repeal some rule perhaps after the
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
federal government has done so okay so
 
00:20:59.930 --> 00:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
just everybody remember we actually
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
passed legislation last year that
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
lowered the fee that it was required for
 
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
someone who was doing a hobby
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
distillation now notice you could
 
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
distill it home all you have to do is
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
get a federal license A and B you then
 
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
pay a new lower from fifteen hundred to
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
three hundred dollars state license and
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
you too can distill at home yes
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bowen what is your
 
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
question or comment thank you yeah I
 
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
know I'm a co-sponsor on this bill okay
 
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.470 align:start position:0%
know I'm a co-sponsor on this bill okay
and

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
for the last two terms
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
the thing is it's
 
00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
what representative Chuck said
 
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
it's a federal against it the federal
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
also says marijuana is illegal yet
 
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
we're ignoring that
 
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
um so the whole argument about
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
just because the federal government says
 
00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
no we have to say no we don't say no on
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
everything the federal government said
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
so the point is
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
is I know a lot some wine and beer
 
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
makers that would like to also
 
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
do this but not for
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
sale I mean for personal use and that
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
kind of thing and and you can go online
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
and buy distilled distillers I mean they
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
say for making perfume but we know that
 
00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:24.419 align:start position:0%
no they actually some of them will say
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
right out front that is for distilling
 
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
all right yeah yeah but so and my whole
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
thing I knew them study I've said this
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
on other committees and it really
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what we say anybody can
 
00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:39.539 align:start position:0%
put in the bill one way or another this
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
just says the last year the interim said
 
00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
he said to bring this forward and not
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
bring this forward that's it but anybody
 
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:48.980 align:start position:0%
can still bring the bill absolutely
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
it'll probably representative Wallace
 
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
and I will probably still put in a bill
 
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
we look forward to seeing it again next
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
year okay any other discussion on the
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
motion I'm not recommended for future
 
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:01.980 align:start position:0%

all right moving right along House Bill
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
488 establishing committee to study the
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
benefits of allowing New Hampshire
 
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
citizens to purchase health insurance
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
from out of state companies
 
00:24:07.799 --> 00:24:13.270 align:start position:0%
from out of state companies
foreign

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative Bartlett you signed up
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
for that one bourbon
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
or did I do do I do that one
 
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
that's me okay representative recognize
 
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:26.220 align:start position:0%
to speak to our motion okay thanks
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
let's see this is um establishing
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
committee to study the benefits of
 
00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:30.059 align:start position:0%
allowing New Hampshire citizens to
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
purchase health insurance from
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
out-of-state companies
 
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
um the motion is not recommended for
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
future legislation this committee
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
continues to believe that consumers are
 
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
better served by purchasing insurance
 
00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419 align:start position:0%
from companies licensed and regulated by
 
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:43.700 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire insurance department
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
if if it were just under consumer
 
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
protection statutes companies would be
 
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
subject to Triple damages and companies
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
don't want to enter the state under
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
those statutes
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
so um that would be my motion okay any
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
discussion on them
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
okay you understand you only get to ask
 
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
one question per Bill okay yes
 
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative so the study committee is
 
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
obviously only a study committee I
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
usually vote against study committees
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
except when this bill was brought up a
 
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
few years ago before this committee and
 
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
the issue has been brought up of course
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
before other committees the question was
 
00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
what was the benefit and of course the
 
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
number one issue brought up is cost
 
00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
savings so the previous insurance
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
commissioner said that the state might
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
save 10 percent or consumers might save
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
10 percent then later seven and then
 
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.450 align:start position:0%
10 percent then later seven and then
five

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
um so the importance of the study
 
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
committee is one to figure out what's
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
the best what's the benefit in terms of
 
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
cost savings but the other benefit other
 
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
benefits could be easier access to
 
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
doctors or medical care or greater
 
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
competition or greater quality of
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
service or greater quality of customer
 
00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
service or whatnot so I felt that the
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
study committee was necessary before we
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
could go forward with other legislation
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
obviously the New Hampshire Republican
 
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
platform says guaranteeing people the
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
ability to buy health and Insurance
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
across state lines if they so choose
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
and for those two reasons I'm voting no
 
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
represent below I am so tired
 
00:26:12.769 --> 00:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
tired platform we are working for the
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire and not for
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
um I I would have to
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
no I'm going to respond and I would say
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
is we I've asked you in the past to not
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
bring up party platform issues in the
 
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
committee that is something you leave
 
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
for the caucus when we're in caucus you
 
00:26:39.529 --> 00:26:39.539 align:start position:0%
can talk about the platform all you want
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
but when you're in session where we're
 
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
in executive session or the house floor
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
for that matter either times you do not
 
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
mention a party platform issue can I
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
respond to that
 
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.269 align:start position:0%
respond to that
it

00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
take it for what it's worth Max oh okay
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
take it for what it's worth okay that's
 
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299 align:start position:0%
my request I 100 disagree with you and
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
the reason is many of us
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
from this term in previous terms when we
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
campaigned people would ask what are you
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
for when I go door to door I go door to
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
door and I campaign and they say well
 
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
what are you for and I say I'm a
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
platform Republican I let people know
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
before the election this is how I vote
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
and I vote 85 90 of the time with the
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
Republican platform I appreciate that
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
and I want to Let's I don't want to
 
00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%
belabor this okay Max so I've asked you
 
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
I just don't agree for the rest of the
 
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.310 align:start position:0%
I just don't agree for the rest of the
day

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%

I'll spill 1019 establishing a committee

to study the replacement of certain
 
00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:45.419 align:start position:0%
professional licenses with mandatory
 
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:49.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh that's representative Bartlett thank
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
um my motion would be not recommended
 
00:30:59.330 --> 00:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
for future legislation
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
and are you want to speak to the
 
00:31:03.049 --> 00:31:03.059 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
um an insurance policy does not take the
 
00:31:06.529 --> 00:31:06.539 align:start position:0%
place of licensing requirements enforced
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
um if enacted the insurance company can
 
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
deny or cancel coverage insurance
 
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
premiums would be much higher if
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
available at all
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
I will elaborate a little bit more on
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
that one okay so motion representative
 
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
are you going to speak on every one of
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
these if I'm voting against uh the
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
majority motion okay go ahead
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
so I disagree with the majority of
 
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
motion um I believe that the issue is
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
worthy of study and the reason is is
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
something that the chairman brought up
 
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
last week that anything under the
 
00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:45.419 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act and almost
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
anything in general that we handle
 
00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
through our courts people need to have
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
recourse there are lots of Professional
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
Licensing 30 percent of workers now have
 
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
to get a state professional license
 
00:31:57.529 --> 00:31:57.539 align:start position:0%
um it can be an onerous process
 
00:31:59.630 --> 00:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
um but my other concern was for
 
00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.490 align:start position:0%
um but my other concern was for
consumers

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
um that uh consumers if someone has a
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
state license but they don't have uh
 
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
business insurance they don't have an
 
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
insurance policy available you have no
 
00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
one to go after
 
00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
um and I felt that from the consumer's
 
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
Vantage Point looking at one piece of
 
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
paper versus different piece of paper
 
00:32:18.899 --> 00:32:19.549 align:start position:0%
paper versus different piece of paper
um

00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure that someone is actually uh
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
able to do the job I felt that the
 
00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
00:32:29.049 --> 00:32:29.059 align:start position:0%
um in my experience have had a tendency
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
especially if they're carrying heavy
 
00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
policy to do due diligence and make sure
 
00:32:35.529 --> 00:32:35.539 align:start position:0%
that not only do people
 
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
show that they have the skills but also
 
00:32:39.889 --> 00:32:39.899 align:start position:0%
maintain them do random inspections and
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
whatnot on equipment so I felt that the
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
bill was worth study or the issue was
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
worth studying
 
00:32:45.899 --> 00:32:47.029 align:start position:0%
worth studying
okay

00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%

all right uh next up House Bill 1245
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
relative co-payments for services
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
rendered by a chiropractor
 
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
okay representative Bartlett recommends
 
00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:15.740 align:start position:0%
not recommend for future legislation
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
Bartlett is recognized to speak to her
 
00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:19.859 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
um we heard testimony on this um that
 
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
went on for quite a while during the
 
00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:24.619 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
and one of the things we had to always
 
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
keep in mind is that the more the
 
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are required to pay
 
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
the higher the premiums are going to be
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
the this bill would like chiropractor
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
chiropractic service to be treated as
 
00:37:40.089 --> 00:37:40.099 align:start position:0%
Primary Care
 
00:37:44.089 --> 00:37:44.099 align:start position:0%
and it was noted that few would go to
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
the primary care physician as often as
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
they are likely to go to a chiropractor
 
00:37:53.569 --> 00:37:53.579 align:start position:0%
um so uh our the committee's feeling has
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
been that we continue to leave
 
00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic as a specialty with a
 
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
different copay if insurance carriers
 
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:07.940 align:start position:0%
any more discussion
 
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none the clerk will call the role
 
00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:11.579 align:start position:0%
I'm not recommended for future
 
00:38:11.579 --> 00:38:12.770 align:start position:0%

okay

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
next up uh House Bill 1378 relative to
 
00:39:10.089 --> 00:39:10.099 align:start position:0%
inspection of public lodging houses
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh this was another one representative
 
00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
greeson I would say is uh
 
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
he he wanted to recommend for further
 
00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:20.510 align:start position:0%
he he wanted to recommend for further
legislation

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
um and but I'm going to again be
 
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
consistent that I'm not recommending
 
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
this bill for for future legislation
 
00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
however I am working on an amendment of
 
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
a bill for next session to really drive
 
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
down at this issue because uh it comes
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
down to is really is the hotel has to
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
have a policy on whether what they're
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
going to do the employee should not be
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
the one who has to make a decision yes
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
or no whether you're going to show it
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
let alone the fact the language is very
 
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
archaic because they're I'm pretty sure
 
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
no Hotel out there actually still has
 
00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
the book in which you sign in on I think
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's a privacy problem right now the
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
get-go uh that uh that we don't have
 
00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
that anymore I I remember in past years
 
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
looking at hotel when I thought somebody
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
was at the Eugene McCarthy was at the
 
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
same Hotel I was at I remember this is
 
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
years ago and I went back looking at the
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
book and to see if his name is signed in
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
so in any way I would say say that this
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
bill is not recommended for you to
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
legislation but this issue will be back
 
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:25.460 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion
 
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
representative abenson
 
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
um so I felt that this was not only a
 
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment issue but so I disagree
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
with the your motion um I think that the
 
00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:35.300 align:start position:0%
bill is fine as written
 
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
and the the statute actually says that
 
00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
all Hotel Keepers and all persons
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
keeping public lodging and so on shall
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
keep a book or card system and cause
 
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
each guest to sign in their own legal
 
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
name so that that mandate is still there
 
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
adding to that uh
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that there was potential for
 
00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.829 align:start position:0%
the fact that there was potential for
abuse

00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
um I asked about that question and got
 
00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
only an insurance from the witness that
 
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
that she would hope that it that this
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
power wouldn't be abused
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
um so we asked whether or not say a
 
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
sheriff's deputy or an officer should
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
simply have to call in a warrant which
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
only takes a couple of minutes
 
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
to uh to do that I felt that that that
 
00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
was a a right and proper that
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
um that that's a simple due process a
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional step that the that that
 
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh that are a login like this would be
 
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
the the property of the hotel owner of
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
the property owner and
 
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:37.430 align:start position:0%
the property owner and
um

that if there isn't some kind of written
 
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
record if there isn't some type of uh
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
search warrant or something that's
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
that's been logged somewhere that
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
there's no way to uh deter the misuse of
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
this power
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%

rule to make sure that there was not an
 
00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.490 align:start position:0%
rule to make sure that there was not an
issue

00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:18.500 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:22.980 align:start position:0%

Bartlett representative Bartlett uh not
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation and
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bartlett is recognized to
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.609 --> 00:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
Commissioners Bettencourt and laborers
 
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
came to testify last week when we got um
 
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
talking about this because they brought
 
00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:50.579 align:start position:0%
up some updated information MetLife has
 
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
offered a proposal and submitted rates
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
and that have been approved to become
 
00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
effective one one of 23. they would like
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
to see the program move forward it is
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
voluntary there it will run for five
 
00:50:04.849 --> 00:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
years with an option with MetLife with
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
an option to request an additional two
 
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
years after that period
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
and so I am not going to but my motion
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
um not recommend that this bill go
 
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:17.210 align:start position:0%
um not recommend that this bill go
forward

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
yeah Mike October 7th to the 20th in the
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Business Review uh there's
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
an article about the ins and outs of the
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
state's family Paid Family Leave plan
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
how the State's new voluntary program
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
works I think it's very informational if
 
00:50:43.609 --> 00:50:43.619 align:start position:0%
I can just put that in the folder that
 
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
would be great yes no I have seen that
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
article and it was a good article
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
Okay click we'll call the roll on not
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%

sale of products containing
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
intentionally added pfas representative
 
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
M and mood said we'd not recommend for
 
00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
future legislation and recommended
 
00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
amendment is recognized to speak to his
 
00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.390 align:start position:0%
amendment is recognized to speak to his
motion

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
um the state of Maine is my
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
understanding has attempted to do this
 
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
and ran into some problems so that could
 
00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
be one reason to wait and also there are
 
00:51:59.569 --> 00:51:59.579 align:start position:0%
many products that have pfas in them
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
that this could have unintentional
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
consequences of banning uh necessary
 
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
products that people use so with those
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
two reasons I recommend
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
not for future legislation
 
00:52:15.049 --> 00:52:15.059 align:start position:0%
representative Amerson representative
 
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
Bartlett had her hand it before I did
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
okay representative Bartlett thank you
 
00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:20.150 align:start position:0%
okay representative Bartlett thank you
representative

00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:20.870 align:start position:0%
representative
um

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:23.579 align:start position:0%
last week after we had our discussion on
 
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
this one um Kathy block from the Des
 
00:52:28.849 --> 00:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
came over to me and said that she wanted
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there was something
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
put in the file saying that the
 
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services is
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
very aware of this situation they have a
 
00:52:43.089 --> 00:52:43.099 align:start position:0%
new numerous
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
efforts going into Commission
 
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
right and a commission that's right
 
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
um already in play I think there's two
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
commissions actually in place talking
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
about this issue
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
um but if we put something in the blurb
 
00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
so that any sponsor
 
00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
um who might come forward in the future
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
knows that there is work going on on
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
this one this particular sponsor
 
00:53:08.089 --> 00:53:08.099 align:start position:0%
um didn't even in the public hearing
 
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
didn't really realize how very
 
00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
complicated an issue it is and was not
 
00:53:14.089 --> 00:53:14.099 align:start position:0%
aware of the study Commissions in place
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
so um I will be supporting the motion
 
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.809 align:start position:0%
so um I will be supporting the motion
okay

00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
and you'll you'll put that in here yeah
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
that's new information to me but I'd
 
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:23.220 align:start position:0%
happily put it into the board yeah I was
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
going to make sure it was in so
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson um so it's
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
something of parliamentary inquiry of
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
the chair um we're saying on some of
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
these bills we're not going to do
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
anything just the first year but we'll
 
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
wait and see what response we get back
 
00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
from state agency or the federal
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
government when we're saying to
 
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
recommend or not recommend are we saying
 
00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
that this only applies for the first
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
year and we're going to wait and then
 
00:53:43.069 --> 00:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
next year somebody might put in a
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
different bill of new information comes
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
up or is it for the whole session
 
00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
um as you know
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
um no legislature can bind a future
 
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
legislature so this vote is only saying
 
00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
that at this moment this bill as it's
 
00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
written was not appropriate for future
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
legislation that's all it says it does
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
not bind anybody from not putting in
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
legislation come
 
00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:12.059 align:start position:0%
when at the two weeks after or ten days
 
00:54:14.809 --> 00:54:14.819 align:start position:0%
after our election in November where we
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
have a window of opportunity to put a
 
00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
new bill in so someone could put in the
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
exact same bill
 
00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:23.579 align:start position:0%
someone could put in something different
 
00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
but if this is kind of an asking we're
 
00:54:25.619 --> 00:54:26.809 align:start position:0%
but if this is kind of an asking we're
saying

00:54:26.809 --> 00:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:29.339 align:start position:0%
we've already discussed in its current
 
00:54:29.339 --> 00:54:31.250 align:start position:0%
we've already discussed in its current
form

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
just as it's written that's all I'm all
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
we are saying here is this bill written
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
this way it could be written differently
 
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
and have a totally different vote but
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's not the specific language or
 
00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
even the issue right now what we're
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
saying is right now unless conditions
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
change at the federal level something
 
00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
changes in the market something changes
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
in the way we we view things or
 
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
something changes from uh different
 
00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
information with state regulatory agency
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
or an ongoing uh civil or criminal case
 
00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
we're saying based on current conditions
 
00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
we're not recommending something but if

based on a changing conditions we're
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%

to know the the NPR story The New
 
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire NPR story today
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
I found incredibly enlightening because
 
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
now I finally realize you know how this
 
00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
is getting around and it's sludge from
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
the Our Town septic or Sound Town uh
 
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
several years ago regarding sludge and
 
00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the spread of sludge on
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
farms lodge on farmlands and here you go
 
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
10 15 years later there's a problem see
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
okay House Bill 1591 eliminating the
 
00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:17.339 align:start position:0%

you oh okay

2022-1591 FN
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
majority of this committee has voted not
 
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
to recommend further action on this
 
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
matter the committee believes that this
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
division is Paramount to the ongoing
 
00:57:54.049 --> 00:57:54.059 align:start position:0%
enforcement and education efforts of the
 
00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Liquor Commission and that
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
removing or diverting these efforts
 
00:58:00.049 --> 00:58:00.059 align:start position:0%
would be detrimental to the ongoing
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
education of our youth about drug and
 
00:58:05.329 --> 00:58:05.339 align:start position:0%
alcohol abuse and use
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
to the edge also the education and
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement of alcohol laws within the
 
00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
adult provider and consumer communities
 
00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay any other representative Abramson
 
00:58:20.089 --> 00:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
um I agree with the motion uh but uh I
 
00:58:22.849 --> 00:58:22.859 align:start position:0%
would like to add even further that
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
um just as some members of the finance
 
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
committee told us just removing a
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
division or removing an enforcement arm
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh change anything it would just
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
it would the the rules are still there
 
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
the regulations are still there the laws
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
are still there and you would still have
 
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
to have those laws be enforced but if
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to have this enforced
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
as kind of a patchwork in some towns by
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
town the town police and some the code
 
00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer in some cases the
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
county attorney's office trying to
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
enforce this you'd have inconsistent
 
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
enforcement of those rules so if if
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
there are people out there who were
 
00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:56.460 align:start position:0%
saying that they wanted to get rid of
 
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
the enforcement division maybe they
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
should be uh targeting the statutes
 
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.569 align:start position:0%
should be uh targeting the statutes
themselves

00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
yes I agree with representative Abramson
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'd rather have a coordinated effort
 
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
than a Helter Skelter
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement thank you
 
00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:17.990 align:start position:0%

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
establishing a Statewide food truck

license represented below
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair uh food truck

operators owners operating in these
 
01:00:21.289 --> 01:00:21.299 align:start position:0%
following cities with health departments

Nashville Portsmouth Rochester and Salem
 
01:00:35.329 --> 01:00:35.339 align:start position:0%
this is an example of local control
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
the state food truck license shall apply
 
01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
to food truck owners operating in all
 
01:00:43.609 --> 01:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
other towns note a food truck owner
 
01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:46.460 align:start position:0%
licensed by the state may purchase a two
 
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:49.799 align:start position:0%
day operating license in cities for a
 
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
fee for events
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
okay any more discussion on the motion
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson
 
01:00:59.569 --> 01:00:59.579 align:start position:0%
um so I I agree that there were problems
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
and issues with the bill but I I support
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
with the bill sponsors we're trying to
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
do and my thought was what would happen
 
01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
if you had a code enforcement officer
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
going to a food truck and the food truck
 
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
owner wanted to just obtain a state
 
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
license because they needed to move from
 
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
town to town for their particular
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
business I'm obviously thinking since I
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
represent the Seacoast I'm obviously
 
01:01:20.329 --> 01:01:20.339 align:start position:0%
thinking of food truck operators that
 
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
that especially during the busy summer
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
season would tend to move to different
 
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
parts of the Seacoast
 
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:28.140 align:start position:0%
um depending on what the traffic is and
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
what the conditions are and I felt that
 
01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:32.339 align:start position:0%
having a food truck operator have to get
 
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
a license different type of license from
 
01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
any different towns uh didn't make sense
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
if there was the option to have them
 
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
just get a state license and just and
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
just take the take the test and have the
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
inspections done uh kind of once and for
 
01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.309 align:start position:0%
inspections done uh kind of once and for
all

01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
good I just want to add to that
 
01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
my daughter has a food truck in um
 
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
in the um in um
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
in Rye and she does have a state food
 
01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
truck license and she's there for the
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
season so many operators that operate
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
food trucks are in the same area
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
um most of the season to make you know
 
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
the most money
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
um that they can into that area
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
not that I want to confuse us anymore
 
01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:21.180 align:start position:0%
but my understanding was even in all
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
those communities they still require you
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
to have a state license state license so
 
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
everyone everybody out there has the
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
state license what this bill would have
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
said was that no town could regulate it
 
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.170 align:start position:0%
said was that no town could regulate it
because

01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:02:39.049 --> 01:02:39.059 align:start position:0%
of someone already having that state
 
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
license so it was having the state Trump
 
01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
local control
 
01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:47.210 align:start position:0%

representative Burroughs yes

representative McAleer yes
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.049 --> 01:03:42.059 align:start position:0%
all right Senate bills
 
01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 68 requiring employer to
 
01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:46.140 align:start position:0%
provide reasonable accommodations for
 
01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
pregnant employees
 
01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:56.510 align:start position:0%
pregnant employees
foreign

01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:02.690 align:start position:0%
 
Johnson

01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:05.220 align:start position:0%
representative Johnson uh not
 
01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
because the way the bill is written in
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
its form is it implies that a pregnant
 
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:16.740 align:start position:0%
employee could come or go as they please
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
rather than the current law which is
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
that when you're taking time off you
 
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
that's it's it that's the clock you know
 
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
that you can't that uh even though there
 
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
was a lot of discussion about just being
 
01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable in terms of a stool or some
 
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
seating arrangement but there was no
 
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
evidence in which that actually had
 
01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
occurred that any employer said no he
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do those kind of accommodations
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
the heart of the bill was the
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
requirement that the current law which
 
01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
is that when a pregnant employee is
 
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
ready to take her leave she takes it and
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
she can't come back until after the baby
 
01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
is done
 
01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:56.500 align:start position:0%
or babies
 
01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:04.250 align:start position:0%
or babies
[Laughter]

01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
it was just a recipe
 
01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:09.500 align:start position:0%
what's up
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
until the birth okay any discussion on
 
01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:19.460 align:start position:0%
the motion of not recommended for future
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
legislation representative Bartlett
 
01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
um I would have to say that I'm going to
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
oppose this
 
01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.069 align:start position:0%
oppose this
um motion

01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
um motion
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
um the I do feel that we need to have
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
something codified that does say they
 
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
need to have accommodations because
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
I mean we're still talking about a small
 
01:05:43.849 --> 01:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
number of workers
 
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
not everybody's pregnant very often
 
01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
then occasionally something does need to
 
01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
be done and I do think this bill has
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
Merit and should move forward okay
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
you know the discussion of the motion
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
representative Evenson so I thought that
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
the issue itself did have Merit did
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
warrant a study committee if another
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
member was thinking of bringing it
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
Forward although I usually don't support
 
01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
study committees
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
um uh the reason that I felt that the
 
01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
issue was worth some type of action or
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
at least some investigation on our part
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
was obviously for the health of the
 
01:06:20.329 --> 01:06:20.339 align:start position:0%
unborn baby and for the the mother that
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh when
 
01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
um uh pregnant mother is put under a lot
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
of stress physical stress emotional
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
stress work related stress for a long
 
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
period of time they can have long-term
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
consequences I also didn't agree with
 
01:06:35.089 --> 01:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
the way that the bill was written but I
 
01:06:37.849 --> 01:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
supported the idea of at least keeping
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
the the bill alive and keeping the idea
 
01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:41.329 align:start position:0%
the the bill alive and keeping the idea
alive

01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:41.339 align:start position:0%
alive
 
01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
um to maybe brainstorm and come up with
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh some way to encourage employers to
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
provide better accommodations
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
so just to remind you this vote today is
 
01:06:53.569 --> 01:06:53.579 align:start position:0%
not telling you the plus and minority of
 
01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
it is is this bill as it's written it
 
01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation
 
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:04.500 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
um many issues with this bill

cannot address
 
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
um perhaps uh there was discussion that
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
perhaps a study committee could address

01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
um in the New Hampshire Insurance

Department's legal
 
01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
I don't remember what her title is like

01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
um Michelle Egan
 
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
um said that this this was the national
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
no surprises act and it's been put in
 
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law the dispute resolution
 
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
issues have been redone by the feds
 
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
the department opposes this bill as
 
01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.090 align:start position:0%
the department opposes this bill as
written

01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
no the department supported this bill
 
01:10:33.169 --> 01:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
well the changes were made that were
 
01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:35.300 align:start position:0%
necessary so it's not enough
 
01:10:39.169 --> 01:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
needed to be perfectly I mean nobody
 
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
here but they they said yeah this is
 
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
fine but uh the concern is that now we
 
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
have two different statutes and their
 
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
argument was that New Hampshire citizens
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
would be better served if the uh the
 
01:10:58.130 --> 01:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
the issue of of the what is the fee
 
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
that's going to be reimbursed if it was
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
ever contested which none of them ever
 
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
have never been departments never had to
 
01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
deal with it since it's been in law now
 
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
for what two years uh but that uh that
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
they would be your be more expeditious
 
01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
if you did it in the state level rather
 
01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
than under the federal statute and so
 
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
they were making an argument for their
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know some I guess the specific
 
01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
territorial issue but I think they still
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
opposed what the bill said no they loved
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
this bill they loved this because they
 
01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
because this bill was saying because
 
01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
they were going to give them the power
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
to okay sorry to get mixed up on that
 
01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
one of my notes that's why
 
01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
but in the spirit of being fair I have
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
to I have to be honest yeah that's fine
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion on any
 
01:11:46.729 --> 01:11:46.739 align:start position:0%

uh I don't have that on my notes but um
I

01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.729 --> 01:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
move forward with this legislation okay
 
01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:12.990 align:start position:0%
well then we don't want your motion then
 
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:18.649 align:start position:0%
well then we don't want your motion then
[Laughter]

01:13:18.649 --> 01:13:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative hunt Okay
 
01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.970 align:start position:0%
representative hunt Okay
um

01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:26.300 align:start position:0%
well given that that the new person
 
01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
involved who brought who worked for the
 
01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
retail Merchants Association
 
01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:33.659 align:start position:0%
brought in something that was about
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
Facebook Marketplace in which the
 
01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
sponsor when she showed up and heard
 
01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
that that's what he did was was livid
 
01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
because she knew full well this
 
01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
legislation would not have one iota
 
01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
effect on the marketplace on Facebook
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
Marketplace so clearly the bill and as
 
01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
in its current form as problematic
 
01:13:59.570 --> 01:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
because it's in the consumer protection
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
statute and it's not a consumer
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
protection issue it is a criminal action
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
that there is criminal activity going on
 
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:12.020 align:start position:0%
it's in the wrong statute and I urge the
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor that to bring this bill by
 
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
assuming she's going to bring it back
 
01:14:18.649 --> 01:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
again next year to
 
01:14:21.169 --> 01:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
put it in a different statue put it in a
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
different RSA a different place that
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
where it truly reflects what she was
 
01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
so it was a statute that was the problem
 
01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
that fundamentally the statue is the
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
problem but enforceability seemed insane
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
and seemed impossible and it it's it's I
 
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
know that we had to feel good build but
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
you know certainly we had testimony from
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
um an Assistant Attorney General that
 
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
showed that it was going to be a problem
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
he made it clear that enforceability
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
would be extremely important so are you
 
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
again again why it reinforces the
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
argument it should be out of that
 
01:14:57.050 --> 01:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
statute it should not be in the consumer
 
01:14:58.850 --> 01:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
protection statute that it should be in
 
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
the criminal statute if they're gonna if
 
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
they're gonna go forward with it at all
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
but again forcibility across state lines
 
01:15:06.530 --> 01:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty complicated issue yeah
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
yes representative Terry Mr chair as if
 
01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:12.620 align:start position:0%
we needed more let me remind
 
01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:15.780 align:start position:0%
uh all of us that there was also an
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
issue with the dollar limits that there
 
01:15:19.729 --> 01:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
was a threshold and the threshold was
 
01:15:19.739 --> 01:15:20.570 align:start position:0%
was a threshold and the threshold was
set

01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
set
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
high so high that there would be people
 
01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:24.659 align:start position:0%
who would Escape
 
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
responsibility under the statute because
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
of the of the dollar threshold limits so
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's also had to be 200. there's a
 
01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
lot of work that really needs 200
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
transactions 200 transactions so there's
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
a lot of work that needs to be done on
 
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
this it needs to be completely reworked
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
okay got it and there is federal
 
01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
legislation uh that is modeled you know
 
01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:45.780 align:start position:0%
that they're working on and they keep
 
01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
hoping that it was going to pass but for
 
01:15:50.689 --> 01:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
some reason it got put off so
 
01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
yes representative Abington
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
so uh I I do support the bill I just
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
support the concept although I recognize
 
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
there's there's a dispute under whether
 
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
or not it should be handled on the
 
01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act
 
01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:05.580 align:start position:0%
um because this would allow people to
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
have recourse through both civil and
 
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
Criminal Courts I would say that I'm not
 
01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
going to object to it being under the
 
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
um but I will re-emphasize that the the
 
01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
the problem of organized crime and I
 
01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
mean very well organized the problem of
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
shoplifting the problem of having items
 
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
that are specifically targeted by it by
 
01:16:31.729 --> 01:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
a group that this that this is a major
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
International issue as a matter of fact
 
01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
a lot of our our products get taken out
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
of retail stores and then shipped
 
01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.510 align:start position:0%
of retail stores and then shipped
overseas

01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
overseas
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
um they're they're very large organized
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
groups that are doing this
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
um I have no no question in my mind that
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
they'll eventually find some way to get
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
out of this but if if
 
01:16:52.679 --> 01:16:53.689 align:start position:0%
out of this but if if
um

01:16:53.689 --> 01:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
the retail sector is is Big the we had
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh representatives of uh retail coming
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
in and saying that they needed this
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
their over 20 states where it's passed
 
01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:06.659 align:start position:0%
you know either the house or Senate and
 
01:17:08.209 --> 01:17:08.219 align:start position:0%
quite a few that have passed both houses
 
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
both bodies have been signed into law
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
the state level I felt that that that it
 
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
really is the state's kind of limited
 
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction or limited purview to
 
01:17:19.729 --> 01:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
protect us from the wrongdoing of others
 
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
to protect us from force and fraud to
 
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
protect us from
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
theft and other other types of crimes
 
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
and there was another argument that I
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
saw online that was made and that is
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of fraudulent
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
material that's that's out there that's
 
01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
being sold online where there's
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely no way to trace it back and
 
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
if people are buying
 
01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
baby formula or food for their kids or
 
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
some such thing that there are a lot of
 
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
safety issues and people need to be able
 
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
to trace it back to an actual seller if
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
somebody's a large-scale seller it's uh
 
01:17:54.649 --> 01:17:54.659 align:start position:0%
I've I've had to do this you know
 
01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
similar type of work for my legislative
 
01:17:59.450 --> 01:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
campaign just for you know online
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
advertising so I don't see that or even
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes even just to rent a car just
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
to put a car on the road so I don't feel
 
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
that it's an onerous burden and I feel
 
01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
that the the need to protect the public
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
from fraud and from theft and the need
 
01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
to protect our retail businesses small
 
01:18:18.169 --> 01:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
and large is is big enough a concern
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
that I'm willing to
 
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
you know wave my regular
 
01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
philosophy and say that that if people
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
are going to sell they need to they need
 
01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
to be registered so we so that people do
 
01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
have recourse
 
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else
 
01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
see none so the motion by me is to not
 
01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
