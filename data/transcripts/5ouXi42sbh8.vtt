00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
so we're going to be passing judgment on
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
eight retained bills this morning
 
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
to refresh your memory there are two
 
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
things we can do with a retained bill at
 
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
this stage of the session
 
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
one is recommendable for future
 
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
legislation the other is do not
 
00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 align:start position:0%
recommend the bill for future
 
00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:29.810 align:start position:0%
recommend the bill for future
legislation

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
so those are the decisions that we'll be
 
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
making today
 
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
now we have three out of the eight bills
 
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
that were heard by a subcommittee so for
 
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
those three bills we're going to go
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
straight to
 
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
an executive session
 
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
the other five bills were not heard by a
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we're going to have a
 
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
brief work session on each of those
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
bills before we move into executive
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
session to make the final determination
 
00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
now I mentioned earlier that today's
 
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
session was going to be a little bit
 
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.070 align:start position:0%
session was going to be a little bit
unusual

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
unusual
 
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
and here's the reason why
 
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
at 10 50
 
00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 align:start position:0%
this morning we're going to take a break
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
from committee work we're not going to
 
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
recess the session we're just going to
 
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
take an extended break
 
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
and the reason for the break is that
 
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a news conference
 
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
downstairs in the lob lobby at 11
 
00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
o'clock and
 
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
some of us on the committee
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
will be participating in that news
 
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
conference so we will take a break
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
from about 10 50 until about 11 30 to
 
00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
participate in that news conference then
 
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
we will resemble reassemble in this room
 
00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
at 11 30 to finish whatever work that we
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
haven't accomplished up to that point
 
00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
if it should be the case that we finish
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
all eight bills before then
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
we will simply adjourn the meeting and
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
say goodbye to each other for the uh for
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
the session
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
for those of you who came in late we did
 
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
take a group picture right before the
 
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
session started uh I hope you were here
 
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
in time to get in in the picture if you
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
weren't we made attempt it again
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
afterwards but
 
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
that might be difficult with people
 
00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:30.419 align:start position:0%
having to go downstairs
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
Etc et cetera but we'll see how that
 
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
works out
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Pitts did you have
 
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
the news conference will be about the
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
do I know that I said we know that we do
 
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
actually oh okay
 
00:07:58.969 --> 00:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
okay we do
 
00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:02.510 align:start position:0%
all right so
uh

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520 align:start position:0%

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
you can all enjoy the news conference
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
later if you so choose but let's get to
 
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
the work of the committee
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
I'd like to open a work session on House
 
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
Bill 213
 
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:17.180 align:start position:0%
and ask the committee if anyone has any
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
concerns any issues any comments they'd
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
like to make about House Bill 213 to
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
refresh your memory that was relative to
 
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
the elimination of useful thermal energy
 
00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:31.139 align:start position:0%
from renewable energy classes
 
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
does anybody want to make a comment
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
Representatives opsich
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah my comment would be I would
 
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
think that this is a this is a bill that
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
we should not recommend for approval
 
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
because as the chairman himself has said
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
next year will be the year of biomass
 
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
and I think this is directly related to
 
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.870 align:start position:0%
and I think this is directly related to
biomass

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
biomass
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative
 
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.550 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative
Harrington

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
Harrington
 
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
yeah I would recommend for this uh
 
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
legislation on this because we've just
 
00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
all been talking about the increase in
 
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
electric prices and this is simply a
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
buried tax in electric rates the
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
electric grade pay shouldn't be paying
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
for useful thermal energy we think
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea we ought to tax
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
something else where people can see it
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
we all talk about transparency if you
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
ask the Thousand electric rate payers in
 
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think maybe other than
 
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
the ones who are directly benefiting
 
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
from this through this subsidy probably
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
one or two of them would know that
 
00:09:32.449 --> 00:09:32.459 align:start position:0%
they're paying for useful thermal energy
 
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
as part of their electric rates we need
 
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
to do whatever we can to lower electric
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
rates and we always should push for
 
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
transparency in government and not hide
 
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
taxes for some place where no one can
 
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
okay any further comment representative
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman
 
00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:54.779 align:start position:0%
um well I I look at this bill and say
 
00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
that uh it may have
 
00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.150 align:start position:0%
that uh it may have
um

00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
it may have some uh use at some point
 
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
but I don't think this particular bill
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
as it is right now is ready uh to go
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
because we do have significant
 
00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:13.019 align:start position:0%
disagreement about whether it is of
 
00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:16.019 align:start position:0%
value to the rate payers and is of value
 
00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:19.019 align:start position:0%
to how we're operating as far as the
 
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
energy portfolio that we're running
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
right now in New Hampshire we don't have
 
00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:25.019 align:start position:0%
any information to indicate that this is
 
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
a good decision and I don't want to see
 
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
us making any more poor decisions around
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
thermal energy and its value to our
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
energy portfolio so I would be in favor
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
of letting this bill go if something
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
comes back in the next session that's a
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
different story but this particular bill
 
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to have a
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
have appropriate vetting so that we know
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
that it would be useful
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Kelly Pitts
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to preach for the last time I
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is dead
 
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
and and I've been saying that for two
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee meetings it's not it's not a
 
00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:04.019 align:start position:0%
bill anymore
 
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
what has to happen if you want to move
 
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
it forward
 
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
and the committee recommends that and
 
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
that's all we're doing recommend or not
 
00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:14.459 align:start position:0%
recommend and then it's up to the people
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
who are here next year to file new
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
legislation or not file new legislation
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
so I I want everybody to understand that
 
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll remind members to turn
 
00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:35.339 align:start position:0%
your microphone off after you finish
 
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
speaking representative oxenham
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair Vos for taking my
 
00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:45.779 align:start position:0%
comment this bill is very much in the
 
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
tradition of the last six to ten years
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
of energy bills coming out of this
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee bills reviewed by this
 
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
committee it's all about trying to gut
 
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
the policies that we instituted to
 
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
assist renewable energy and to assist
 
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency which are the two
 
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
proven ways to reduce costs reduce rates
 
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
and reduce people's bills I had hoped
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
that after the recent Embrace of biomass
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
by the Republican majority that we had
 
00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:23.339 align:start position:0%
seen and ended this kind of Bill and I
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
certainly thought this bill would have
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
been swept under the carpet at the
 
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
beginning of this meeting I'm delighted
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
that it was called out and then we
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't point to this as absolutely a
 
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
picture-perfect example of Republican
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
policy on energy and it's the reason we
 
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
have the highest rates the highest bills
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
um boring only Hawaii we need to be
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
investing money we have thrown away a
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
million and a half dollars of Reggie
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
money which was not invested which did
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
not decrease people's costs which did
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
not weatherize homes
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
and the RPS we have had to close down
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
our programs because there's no money
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
because wreck sweeping means we don't
 
00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
have alternative compliance payments I
 
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
would like to see this bill recommended
 
00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
for further action just to bring to
 
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
everyone's notice what kind of policies
 
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:21.180 align:start position:0%
have been put forward during this
 
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.069 align:start position:0%
have been put forward during this
session

00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any further comment
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the work
 
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 213 and open an
 
00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 213 and
 
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:38.300 align:start position:0%
I recognize
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I'd like to
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
make a motion Mr chairman
 
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
I would move that we recommend this bill
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
for further legislation
 
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Thomas second
 
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that we
 
00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:54.779 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill for future
 
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:00.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:02.540 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk to call the roll on
 
00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
the question of
 
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation on
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
House Bill 213.
 
00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:18.790 align:start position:0%

the clerk is doing his uh due diligence
 
00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:25.139 align:start position:0%
on paperwork so it'll take just a second
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%

00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
the committee votes to recommend this
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
bill for future legislation I'll close
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
the executive session on House Bill 213.
 
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
now I'd like to open a work session on
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1248 this is a bill relative
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
to replacement power for net metering
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
customer generators
 
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.970 align:start position:0%
customer generators
and

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
ask the committee if anybody has any
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
comment on this legislation I'll just
 
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
refresh everyone's memory that this bill
 
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
sought to require
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
renewable energy generators who
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
are intermittent to acquire replacement
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
power for the periods of time when
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
they're not producing power of Their Own
 
00:17:54.289 --> 00:17:54.299 align:start position:0%
but the bill provided no mechanism to do
 
00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
that and had many other flaws and that's
 
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
why it was moved to interim study there
 
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
has been no new developments on
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
by the prime sponsor on how to fix the
 
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
Bill's flaws
 
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have any comments to
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
make representative samsich
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
well I would just I would just point out
 
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
that in most cases when you have a
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
renewable energy project uh the the
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
entities the businesses that engage in
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
this will require some type of
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
compensation or replacement anyway so I
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
don't think that that is that a bill is
 
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
needed for that it is already happening
 
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.230 align:start position:0%
needed for that it is already happening
now

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
okay any further comment representative
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chair yeah and just
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
to add on to that for folks who are
 
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
smaller generations and who are not
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
entered into those kind of pp
 
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
uh Arrangements uh
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
they basically are
 
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
adding uh Supply locally so that
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
additional energy doesn't have to be
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
brought into the supply from out of
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
state so they were always designed to be
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
an adder and not uh the same as you know
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
the firm energy that we require to be at
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
a higher rate so it it's a it's a plus
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
and I think this bill took us in the
 
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
wrong direction trying to say that it
 
00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:18.419 align:start position:0%
needed to be something that it's not
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
intended to be so
 
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
that's all okay any further comment
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGee seeing
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
none I'd like to close the work session
 
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
and open an executive session on House
 
00:19:33.169 --> 00:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
Bill 1248 and I recognize representative
 
00:19:33.179 --> 00:19:37.250 align:start position:0%
Bill 1248 and I recognize representative
Platt

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
yes I move to not recommend
 
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
I recognize representative Thomas second
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that we not
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill for future
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
legislation is there any further comment
 
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
or discussion
 
00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:55.700 align:start position:0%
I would just say in support of my motion
 
00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
there's no way to enforce first of all
 
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
if we were to require replacement power
 
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh second there uh since they never got
 
00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:09.059 align:start position:0%
a capacity payment there's no obligation
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh so those are the two killers right
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
there and if ISO New England if it grows
 
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
enough to be a problem ISO New England
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
will point it out and at some future
 
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
gate but right now that since they don't
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
counter Mis capacity that's all they
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
make that up through their
 
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
capacity Market with other resources
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
okay any further discussion who seconded
 
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
that sorry representative Thomas
 
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
seconded the motion
 
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none I'll ask the work clerk
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%

open a work session on HB 1635.
 
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
this bill was relative to the purchase
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
of the output of limited electrical
 
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.140 align:start position:0%

qualifying storage systems
 
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
we sent this bill to interim study as
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
you'll all recall because it was super
 
00:22:56.529 --> 00:22:56.539 align:start position:0%
seated by a Senate bill Senate Bill 321
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
which passed out of this committee with
 
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
an amendment was concurred by the the
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
Senate and was eventually signed by the
 
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.890 align:start position:0%
Senate and was eventually signed by the
governor

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
and representative McGee who originally
 
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
filed this bill agreed that it was no
 
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:15.539 align:start position:0%
longer necessary having been superseded
 
00:23:15.539 --> 00:23:16.549 align:start position:0%
longer necessary having been superseded
by

00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
uh Senate Bill 321

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
need to have on this particular
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%

not present representative partial yes
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
okay that would make it 18 of the chair
 
00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.630 align:start position:0%
okay that would make it 18 of the chair
yes

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
that would make it 18-0 and four not
 
00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.770 align:start position:0%
that would make it 18-0 and four not
present

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
okay by a vote of 18 to nothing the
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
committee recommends not recommended for
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
future legislation on HB 1635 I'll close
 
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
that public hearing
 
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
or uh executive session rather
 
00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
and the next bill on our list is HB 1644
 
00:25:39.049 --> 00:25:39.059 align:start position:0%
and because there was a subcommittee on
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
this particular bill there's no need for
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
any a work session so I'm going to open
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
an executive session on HB 1644 and
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
the motion is to the motion is for
 
00:25:59.390 --> 00:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
further legislative action whatever that
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
might be somebody speak to my motion
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
yes after we get a second uh
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative Platt is recognized oh
 
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
second it's been moved and seconded to
 
00:26:12.409 --> 00:26:12.419 align:start position:0%
recommend right it's been moved in
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
second and that we recommend for future
 
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
legislation House Bill 1644 and
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas is recognized to
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
speak to the motion yes uh during our
 
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
work session it was um uh decided that
 
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.970 align:start position:0%
work session it was um uh decided that
uh

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:27.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
something addition should be done on
 
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
this subject matter and what came to
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
light were perhaps education might be
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
needed for people on the pros and cons
 
00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
of RF radiation and also what came to
 
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
light was perhaps a lack of
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of what local communities
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
can do in terms of the tower placements
 
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
so because of this additional
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
information that came forward and really
 
00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
not for anything else we we decided that
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's room for further
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
legislative action to that might want to
 
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
cover those particular subjects and
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
that's that was the emphasis and the
 
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
basis for the recommendation for further
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
legislative action there was uh no other
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
question for you representative Thomas
 
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
what was the subcommittee vote on that
 
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
legislation subcommittee vote I believe
 
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.750 align:start position:0%
legislation subcommittee vote I believe
was

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
four to one
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh representative white was not present
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
and uh so it was
 
00:27:33.169 --> 00:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
five to one excuse me five to one
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
because uh representative bresney was
 
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
part of our committee so it was five to
 
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.450 align:start position:0%
part of our committee so it was five to
one

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
okay is there any further discussion on
 
00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation representative
 
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.529 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation representative
oxenham

00:27:45.529 --> 00:27:45.539 align:start position:0%
oxenham
 
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking this
 
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
question uh clarification you mentioned
 
00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:51.059 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
lack of understanding of what local
 
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
communities can do in terms of citing
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
could you share with us what your
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee may have discovered about
 
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
this that we did not hear in the
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
original public hearing
 
00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:06.110 align:start position:0%
original public hearing
uh

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.730 align:start position:0%
uh
basically

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:07.740 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.930 align:start position:0%
basically
uh

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
we learned that in terms of Aesthetics
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
or other
 
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:15.890 align:start position:0%
or other
um

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh or in terms of um safety in terms of
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
if a tower were to fall down and hit a
 
00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:23.779 align:start position:0%
particularly critical item like a school
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh that the towns would have reason to
 
00:28:30.289 --> 00:28:30.299 align:start position:0%
decide where a tower could be placed
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
along those lines and there seemed to be
 
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
a lack of understanding that some towns
 
00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.070 align:start position:0%
a lack of understanding that some towns
uh

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
recognize that fact and so we we felt
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
that additional information and
 
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
education would be needed in case towns
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to take those things in into
 
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
consideration also it was brought up by
 
00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:51.539 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Pitts that uh there
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
was a lot of Education or a lot of
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding that may not be out
 
00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:57.799 align:start position:0%
there to the local public and perhaps
 
00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:00.260 align:start position:0%
some entity from the state agency
 
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
perhaps something like Department of
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
energy we don't know might be able to
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
put out some education for people to
 
00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:10.700 align:start position:0%
better understand what is or isn't
 
00:29:14.289 --> 00:29:14.299 align:start position:0%
safe in involving RF radiation
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
those things came to light during the
 
00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
the work session and so for those
 
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
reasons we felt that some type of
 
00:29:22.669 --> 00:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
legislative action might be warranted in
 
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
the future so that's why we we voted
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
that way thank you representative Callie
 
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:35.210 align:start position:0%
that way thank you representative Callie
Pitts

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:36.419 align:start position:0%
but I think
 
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
I think that what
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not discussing here or what we need
 
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:43.559 align:start position:0%
to stick to is what we are doing here
 
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
and not the content and and that sort of
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
thing I think I would I would ask the
 
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
chair to review just the caption of what
 
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
the bill is because I don't know if this
 
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
is being filmed or not because a lot of
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
people don't know what 1644 is
 
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
so I would just say that's what it is
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
but ours is not to go through the the
 
00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
details ours is to just do we think we
 
00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and I apologize for not
 
00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
reading the title of the bill the bill
 
00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
is relative to the placement of
 
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
telecommunication antenna and
 
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
establishing a registry for residents
 
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
who are experiencing biological symptoms
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
from Wireless radiation exposure is
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
there any further discussion from
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
representative sausage
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas I just wanted to
 
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
ask in regard to the the study committee
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
uh was there any talk about uh the
 
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
impact of these towers on real estate
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
values I know this is happening in
 
00:30:48.769 --> 00:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
various places in the country where uh
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
when these towers are very close to
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
residential areas uh there there is a
 
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
genuine impact on real estate values was
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
there any discussion about that in the
 
00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
study committee not directly no
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
um the discussion was primarily around
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
safety or fire hazards on Towers if they
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
were too close some particular critical
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
facility if they were to fall or catch
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
fire it could present some type of a
 
00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:16.980 align:start position:0%
safety hazard that way but nothing about
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
property values during that discussion
 
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
representative nodder
 
00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I was the one no
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
vote on the subcommittee because I have

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
public housing authorities or housing
 
00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:10.500 align:start position:0%

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.950 align:start position:0%
authorities and the peas Development
Authority

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.910 align:start position:0%
Authority
um

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:17.780 align:start position:0%
so the discussion went broader than that
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
indicating that there there was
 
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to address some of the
 
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
issues associated with Municipal
 
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
boundaries not and and utility
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
boundaries not being coincident and and
 
00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:37.940 align:start position:0%
therefore this bill could correct that
 
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
potentially but the bill is written
 
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't correct that so we had
 
00:39:47.569 --> 00:39:47.579 align:start position:0%
a a vote of two to one
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
um in favor of
 
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
A continuing on with the legislation
 
00:39:59.930 --> 00:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
but to be amended to address these uh
 
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
issues that are not in the bill and and
 
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
um so I was the one member who said no
 
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
the bill is currently written does not
 
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
address that so I voted no
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
thank you any future further discussion
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair yes as one
 
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
of the people that voted for the
 
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
recommendation to move forward that was
 
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
to bring it to the attention of this
 
00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
body understanding as
 
00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Pitts has told us
 
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
repeatedly that we're not going to
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
change the bill today but to go on to
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
the record as saying this is a bill
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
where there is a demonstrated need for
 
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
action and I strongly encourage someone
 
00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
on the committee and I think I have a
 
00:40:50.089 --> 00:40:50.099 align:start position:0%
candidate to to file a bill at the next
 
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
legislative window but I I passed out
 
00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
once again the the color picture this is
 
00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
a problem the municipal Association is
 
00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
now involved they will be lobbying in
 
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
favor of action to rectify this problem
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
because ninety percent of the towns in
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
our state cannot use this legislation
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
because their their population is too
 
00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:14.099 align:start position:0%
small their load is too small and or as
 
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
is the case for the town that I
 
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
principally represent they have three
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
utilities for a town of 3 400 people and
 
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
coming up with with the load of one
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
megawatt is uh you know you're not going
 
00:41:28.609 --> 00:41:28.619 align:start position:0%
to be able to find a cost-efficient way
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
to to go forward so just just wanted to
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
put that in the record that as our chair
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
said in May this is a problem and it
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed and I strongly
 
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
encourage everyone to support the bill
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to you next year thank you
 
00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion on
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call

don't we have to pass emotion
 
00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
is that the committee consensus yes
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
all right well we will dismiss my motion

00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
all right we're Consulting with an
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%

00:45:01.849 --> 00:45:01.859 align:start position:0%
so the official uh the the expert
 
00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.220 align:start position:0%
recommendation is we do have to vote on
 
00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
a motion to not recommend okay we can't
 
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
just turn down emotion we have to vote
 
00:45:14.089 --> 00:45:14.099 align:start position:0%
positively on a motion
 
00:45:14.099 --> 00:45:17.150 align:start position:0%
positively on a motion
so

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
we just we just had an opinion from
 
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.230 align:start position:0%
we just we just had an opinion from
um

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee staff so
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask the clerk to call the
 
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
role on the question of not recommended
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
for future legislation motion has to be
 
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
oh you withdrew it I didn't hear you do
 
00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
that I agree I thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
will remake the motion to not recommend
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
for future legislation
 
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
a second representative Thomas seconds
 
00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
the motion okay so now we can go forward
 
00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
please call the roll Mr clerk yeah but
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
that will take me a moment because this
 
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:01.140 align:start position:0%
is catching me all by surprise okay
 
00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:04.849 align:start position:0%
is catching me all by surprise okay
people

00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:07.619 align:start position:0%
for me it's a waste of time
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:34.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
I believe Masons would say that if a
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
motion is defeated then you have to make
 
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
a new motion
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
to State your position so
 
00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:50.099 align:start position:0%
I think we're doing the right thing here
 
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
and as soon as the clerk is ready we're
 
00:46:56.089 --> 00:46:56.099 align:start position:0%
going to do it I'm emptying the last
 
00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
vote tally
 
00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:00.020 align:start position:0%
so I can redo it
 
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.400 align:start position:0%

okay by a vote of eleven to six the

committee adopts the recommendation that
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
we not recommend this bill for future
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
legislation so I'll close the executive
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
session on Senate bill 259.
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
now we are going to take a break
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
until 11 30 we have two bills to finish
 
00:49:23.569 --> 00:49:23.579 align:start position:0%
at 11 30. I suspect that
 
00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099 align:start position:0%
we will be able to finish those by noon
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
time which would be
 
00:49:31.849 --> 00:49:31.859 align:start position:0%
a welcome finish to our
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%

01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
okay while we're waiting for the
 
01:41:42.050 --> 01:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
stragglers to return to the committee
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
room here
 
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
I would like to open a work session on
 
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 264.
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
which is a bill relative to certain
 
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
references to the Department of energy
 
01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
and transferring authority over the
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
low-income electric electricity
 
01:42:01.129 --> 01:42:01.139 align:start position:0%
assistance program to the Department of
 
01:42:01.139 --> 01:42:03.229 align:start position:0%
assistance program to the Department of
energy

01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:42:07.850 --> 01:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
and I would remind members that when we
 
01:42:10.129 --> 01:42:10.139 align:start position:0%
had the public hearing on this bill the
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
department of energy and the Public
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission were in
 
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
disagreement about
 
01:42:18.609 --> 01:42:18.619 align:start position:0%
uh the authority over the low-income
 
01:42:21.290 --> 01:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
electricity assistance program
 
01:42:24.770 --> 01:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
and the transfer to the Department of
 
01:42:30.050 --> 01:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
energy was uh the department of energy
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
withdrew its request for the transfer of
 
01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
that Authority so this bill was sent to
 
01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
interim study because of that and
 
01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:41.030 align:start position:0%
interim study because of that and
um

01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
it would appear that the the question is
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
moot at this point is there any
 
01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
discussion on this uh Mr chairman Bill
 
01:42:53.090 --> 01:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
64 264. representative Harrington thank
 
01:42:54.770 --> 01:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
you uh I might just say since we have a
 
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative of the Department of
 
01:42:57.890 --> 01:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
energy here would it be appropriate to
 
01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
ask him what their present position is
 
01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely
 
01:43:06.649 --> 01:43:06.659 align:start position:0%
well sorry Griffin but I guess you're on
 
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
the hook so what is the Department of
 
01:43:11.450 --> 01:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
Energy's current position on Senate bill
 
01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:15.109 align:start position:0%
Energy's current position on Senate bill
264.

01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate you being here and
 
01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
being willing to
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
01:43:28.729 --> 01:43:28.739 align:start position:0%
Griffin Roberge State energy program
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
manager with the Department of energy
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
I believe the department just wanted to
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
confer with the puc a little bit more on
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
the programmatic structure of this
 
01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
change before moving forward with it
 
01:43:42.890 --> 01:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
additionally there are also some
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
language changes as I think you might
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
all recall from this I think you should
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
say on veto day with House Bill 1223
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
there was some additional language in
 
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
there that would restrict the puc from
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
making any modification to the SBC to uh
 
01:43:58.970 --> 01:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
for the electric assistance program as
 
01:44:00.590 --> 01:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
you recall that bill put an additional
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars into the electric
 
01:44:05.209 --> 01:44:05.219 align:start position:0%
assistance program to shore it up so I
 
01:44:06.590 --> 01:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
think at this point the department of
 
01:44:08.689 --> 01:44:08.699 align:start position:0%
puc would like further discussion on
 
01:44:11.290 --> 01:44:11.300 align:start position:0%
this bill before moving forward
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on Senate bill or
 
01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
actually before we do that any further
 
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
questions from Mr robarge from the
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
committee representative Kelly Pitts I
 
01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:25.860 align:start position:0%
have a question a real question when do
 
01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
you expect that some of this money will
 
01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
start flowing
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming that and maybe I
 
01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
shouldn't assume that rules have to be
 
01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
developed and uh thank you for the
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
question I guess a question back to you
 
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
are you talking regarding the electric
 
01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
assistance program or all the various
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
programs that were under HP 2023 various
 
01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
programs various programs so uh the
 
01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
electric assistance program to the best
 
01:44:49.729 --> 01:44:49.739 align:start position:0%
of my knowledge is something that's been
 
01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
continually going
 
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
um consumers residents can apply to
 
01:44:55.609 --> 01:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
their Community Action Program and
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
obviously have to meet eligibility
 
01:44:59.209 --> 01:44:59.219 align:start position:0%
standards to access that funding the
 
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
additional 7 million into that program
 
01:45:04.370 --> 01:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
it's just meant to shore it up because
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
we anticipate increased demand in terms
 
01:45:09.729 --> 01:45:09.739 align:start position:0%
of the other one-time benefits the 200
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
one-time electric benefit and the 450
 
01:45:16.129 --> 01:45:16.139 align:start position:0%
dollar fuel assistance benefit I believe
 
01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge that those
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
contracts with the cap agencies were
 
01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
recently approved at governor and
 
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
Council I imagine the program will
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
likely be underway soon I just would be
 
01:45:29.209 --> 01:45:29.219 align:start position:0%
hesitant to give a specific timeline or
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
anything like that but I know the I know
 
01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
there's certainly an urgency to get
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
those up and running sooner rather than
 
01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:34.970 align:start position:0%
those up and running sooner rather than
later

01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
will uh gas be included natural gas be
 
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
included in those programs
 
01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:44.689 align:start position:0%

so representative Mann you were here
 
01:49:29.149 --> 01:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
when the question was put and even
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
though you did not hear the discussion
 
01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
there's some question about whether you
 
01:49:36.770 --> 01:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
whether you need to vote uh on the
 
01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:38.390 align:start position:0%
whether you need to vote uh on the
question

01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:49:41.090 --> 01:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
we've asked the clerk okay and we're
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for an answer I'll vote no
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
okay representative Mann votes no
 
01:49:46.679 --> 01:49:48.410 align:start position:0%

01:49:51.290 --> 01:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
yes five no
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
and uh five not present
 
01:49:57.229 --> 01:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
okay by a vote of 12 to 5 the committee
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
adopts the recommendation of not
 
01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation on
 
01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 264. so we'll close the
 
01:50:08.629 --> 01:50:08.639 align:start position:0%
executive session on Senate bill 264.
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
and go to the final bill of the day and
 
01:50:14.810 --> 01:50:14.820 align:start position:0%
this bill was referred to a subcommittee
 
01:50:16.490 --> 01:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
so we do not have to have a work session
 
01:50:18.770 --> 01:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
on it now we'll go straight to an
 
01:50:22.010 --> 01:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
executive session on Senate Bill 269 and
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I will read the title of the
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill Senate Bill 269 establishing a
 
01:50:37.570 --> 01:50:37.580 align:start position:0%
commission to study energy saving
 
01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs
 
01:50:43.129 --> 01:50:43.139 align:start position:0%
representative murder
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
yes we had a meeting on Tuesday on this
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
work session on this bill in a chemo
 
01:50:48.719 --> 01:50:49.490 align:start position:0%
work session on this bill in a chemo
um

01:50:49.490 --> 01:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
five to one vote not to recommend for uh
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
for the legislation
 
01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's so that is your emotion and
 
01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
that's my motion that's recommended
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas second
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
moved and seconded that we judge Senate
 
01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
Bill 269 to be not recommended for
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
future legislation is there any
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Mann
 
01:51:14.930 --> 01:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
please use your microphone
 
01:51:16.850 --> 01:51:16.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
um what's my option to can I discuss
 
01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
anything about the bill or anything
 
01:51:24.370 --> 01:51:24.380 align:start position:0%
about that what is it
 
01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
yes you can you can you can discuss the
 
01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation was five to one
 
01:51:32.090 --> 01:51:32.100 align:start position:0%
not to recommend right but we don't have
 
01:51:33.649 --> 01:51:33.659 align:start position:0%
to follow them but we're all going to
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
vote and we don't have to vote yay on
 
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
that we can vote nay thank you okay
 
01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
um well my discussion would be
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I hope it's more more
 
01:51:46.129 --> 01:51:46.139 align:start position:0%
coherent then
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays but anyway
 
01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:48.530 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays but anyway
um

01:51:48.530 --> 01:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
the bill has an awful lot of content
 
01:51:54.649 --> 01:51:54.659 align:start position:0%
about Energy Efficiency and uh however
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency is a wide wide wide
 
01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:57.770 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency is a wide wide wide
subject

01:51:57.770 --> 01:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
subject
 
01:52:00.050 --> 01:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
and it's not well understood
 
01:52:02.450 --> 01:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
um one of the areas that's got the
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
biggest Financial impact to the state is
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency of buildings we call
 
01:52:10.370 --> 01:52:10.380 align:start position:0%
it building Energy Efficiency and what
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
happens with that is
 
01:52:13.609 --> 01:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
um you know it's about where the
 
01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:16.139 align:start position:0%
building is able to resist winter cold
 
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
and summer heat essentially without
 
01:52:21.770 --> 01:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
spending excess of energy
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
so there's a big impact with that and um
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
one of the impacts one of the pieces of
 
01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
that is that buildings are heated and
 
01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
there's a great deal of fossil energy
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
spent in heating buildings it's not just
 
01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
electrical energy that we're talking
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
about saving so if you can reduce the
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
amount of air conditioning or heating or
 
01:52:47.810 --> 01:52:47.820 align:start position:0%
building needs you're saving both
 
01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
electricity and
 
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
CO2 generation but that's different
 
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
subject and the cost for fuel
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
and there's other various things first
 
01:53:02.689 --> 01:53:02.699 align:start position:0%
of all um it seems that a long-term
 
01:53:05.149 --> 01:53:05.159 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency program if we
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
scheduled one to do Energy Efficiency
 
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
for buildings
 
01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
could produce uh an accelerating would
 
01:53:15.070 --> 01:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
produce an accelerating
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
return on investment and the reason for
 
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
that is that every building that you
 
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
insulate will stay insulated for the
 
01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
rest of it's live until it burns down or
 
01:53:25.689 --> 01:53:25.699 align:start position:0%
something so
 
01:53:28.370 --> 01:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
those all build up and if you graph it
 
01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
out the return on investment
 
01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
goes up with a square function in other
 
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
words it accelerates so over time you
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
get to the point where the previously
 
01:53:43.370 --> 01:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
done Energy Efficiency work saves enough
 
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
money for the economy for the economy to
 
01:53:47.209 --> 01:53:47.219 align:start position:0%
keep spending it on More Energy
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
Efficiency for to finish the job with
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
all the other buildings so it's a really
 
01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
major major subject area the financing
 
01:53:58.669 --> 01:53:58.679 align:start position:0%
the benefits how it has to be done the
 
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
quality control
 
01:54:03.530 --> 01:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
you know what a focus is and so on that
 
01:54:06.050 --> 01:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
really needs work and
 
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
um so I highly recommend that this um
 
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
that this bill that we passed this um
 
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
I recommend this bill for further study
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
because it is a very important and
 
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
useful Bill thank you although I would
 
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
perfectly well admit it's as written it
 
01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
needs a lot of amendment thank you
 
01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh further discussion
 
01:54:33.530 --> 01:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
I voted against this bill coming through
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
and I I would do it again we've been
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
doing Energy Efficiency
 
01:54:42.530 --> 01:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
for as long as I can remember we started
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
out with plastic and tape we've moved to
 
01:54:46.609 --> 01:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
Total insulation we've done light bulbs
 
01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
we've been working on this forever
 
01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
however my feeling on this bill was we
 
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
don't need another commission
 
01:54:58.370 --> 01:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
we studied it to death we know what we
 
01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
01:55:01.850 --> 01:55:01.860 align:start position:0%
and instead of doing this we need to
 
01:55:06.890 --> 01:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
just do it and I do believe that
 
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
there are members of this Legend the
 
01:55:12.649 --> 01:55:12.659 align:start position:0%
next legislature who will introduce
 
01:55:17.090 --> 01:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
legislation to do just that thank you
 
01:55:19.370 --> 01:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative samsich
 
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
um well I greatly respect my colleague
 
01:55:30.109 --> 01:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
representative Mann's comments about
 
01:55:32.209 --> 01:55:32.219 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
I also agree with representative Kelly
 
01:55:39.050 --> 01:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
Pitts that
 
01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:40.010 align:start position:0%
Pitts that
um

01:55:40.010 --> 01:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:42.169 --> 01:55:42.179 align:start position:0%
that a commission like this is totally
 
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
unnecessary we already know that
 
01:55:46.609 --> 01:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
weatherization works we know why it
 
01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
works a low-income residents have
 
01:55:51.470 --> 01:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
already been receiving weatherization
 
01:55:54.649 --> 01:55:54.659 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs it has been
 
01:55:57.410 --> 01:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
demonstrated to work so the only way I
 
01:55:58.850 --> 01:55:58.860 align:start position:0%
would ever vote for a commission like
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
this is if itself through its
 
01:56:03.410 --> 01:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
discussions and hot air could generate
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
some energy on its own otherwise I think
 
01:56:08.689 --> 01:56:08.699 align:start position:0%
it's a waste of time and money
 
01:56:13.010 --> 01:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:15.590 --> 01:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh representative Mann I'll
 
01:56:22.810 --> 01:56:22.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
well we do appreciate the education
 
01:56:29.209 --> 01:56:29.219 align:start position:0%
you've given us about Energy Efficiency
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
and building rather whetherization but
 
01:56:34.129 --> 01:56:34.139 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that's mostly about a
 
01:56:36.649 --> 01:56:36.659 align:start position:0%
commission so keep that right and I
 
01:56:38.810 --> 01:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
think uh if you notices all the
 
01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are involved
 
01:56:44.570 --> 01:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
the governor the
 
01:56:47.209 --> 01:56:47.219 align:start position:0%
all the utilities
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's just a wide range of people and
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
they all have different perspectives the
 
01:56:53.590 --> 01:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
utilities for example have been getting
 
01:56:56.689 --> 01:56:56.699 align:start position:0%
decent money to help with Energy
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
Efficiency by uh buying new
 
01:57:02.330 --> 01:57:02.340 align:start position:0%
refrigerators for
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
you know low-income customers
 
01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
now that saves a little electricity but
 
01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's insignificant and that money might
 
01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
better be spent
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
weatherizing three or four little houses
 
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot to do in that
 
01:57:20.209 --> 01:57:20.219 align:start position:0%
commission this is a major major subject
 
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
area very poorly understood it's almost
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
laughable we talk about Energy
 
01:57:27.709 --> 01:57:27.719 align:start position:0%
Efficiency as if we all knew all about
 
01:57:30.649 --> 01:57:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:32.510 --> 01:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
I'm the only person in this committee
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
that has done any analysis mathematical
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
analysis of what the well how the thing
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
goes how it's done
 
01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
I've been involved in several Energy
 
01:57:43.609 --> 01:57:43.619 align:start position:0%
Efficiency projects my house cannot be
 
01:57:45.770 --> 01:57:45.780 align:start position:0%
made more Energy Efficiency it was
 
01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:47.750 align:start position:0%
made more Energy Efficiency it was
designed

01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
designed
 
01:57:51.530 --> 01:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.169 --> 01:57:54.179 align:start position:0%
I even have
 
01:57:56.750 --> 01:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
a cold roof separating it from the real
 
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
roof because if we had our shingles on
 
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
an insulated roof that we have
 
01:58:06.169 --> 01:58:06.179 align:start position:0%
the sun would curl them up and they'd
 
01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
rot away from the Heat
 
01:58:11.689 --> 01:58:11.699 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot to know about this and
 
01:58:14.570 --> 01:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
I I so tried to make that clear
 
01:58:16.850 --> 01:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
yesterday but I certainly
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sounding more like an old man but um
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh so I I really think a commission uh
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
that is a serious commission could
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
really dig into this and hopefully you'd
 
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
have members on it that had a very
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
strong point of view so we could have
 
01:58:35.570 --> 01:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
some really solid discussions thank you
 
01:58:37.970 --> 01:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll end it there I won't say
 
01:58:40.129 --> 01:58:40.139 align:start position:0%
another word
 
01:58:42.050 --> 01:58:42.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I'd also remind the
 
01:58:44.089 --> 01:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
committee members that the Energy
 
01:58:46.189 --> 01:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
Efficiency landscape is going to change
 
01:58:48.350 --> 01:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
fairly significantly going forward
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
because the so-called inflation
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
reduction Act
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh sends a lot of money to the states to
 
01:58:59.330 --> 01:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
do Energy Efficiency and New Hampshire
 
01:59:02.689 --> 01:59:02.699 align:start position:0%
is in line to get tens of millions of
 
01:59:05.810 --> 01:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
new dollars for Energy Efficiency so
 
01:59:09.290 --> 01:59:09.300 align:start position:0%
the distribution and expenditure of that
 
01:59:12.729 --> 01:59:12.739 align:start position:0%
money is going to be of significant
 
01:59:16.189 --> 01:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
discussion and concern over the next uh
 
01:59:19.129 --> 01:59:19.139 align:start position:0%
several years
 
01:59:21.410 --> 01:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
see no further discussion on the
 
01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
question I would like to ask the clerk
 
01:59:26.689 --> 01:59:26.699 align:start position:0%
to call the roll on the question of not
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%

your constituents and I'm very grateful

um this committee whoever comes back on
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
it is never going to be the same as far
 
02:02:37.490 --> 02:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
as I'm concerned I was first served here
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
in 2002 and uh Jackie was on there at
 
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
that time and I just got envisioned the
 
02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
committee without her she lost into
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
primary I know the committee and the
 
02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
house of New Hampshire House of
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
Representatives a better place with her
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
in it and we'll miss you a lot Jackie
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Harrington and
 
02:03:04.729 --> 02:03:04.739 align:start position:0%

02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
completed uh
 
02:03:15.470 --> 02:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham as a comment I'd
 
02:03:16.970 --> 02:03:16.980 align:start position:0%

illness to supply very needed services
 
02:03:35.629 --> 02:03:35.639 align:start position:0%
for this committee but again the the
 
02:03:37.729 --> 02:03:37.739 align:start position:0%
fact that the fights never degenerated
 
02:03:39.770 --> 02:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
into fist fights the fact that there was
 
02:03:42.169 --> 02:03:42.179 align:start position:0%
no name calling and we could uh you know
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%

02:04:02.089 --> 02:04:02.099 align:start position:0%

02:04:12.070 --> 02:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
you have gotten a reprieve thank you
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas yes thank you I
 
02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:17.159 align:start position:0%
just want to add for the record
 
02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
what we've gone through in these last
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
two years here is nothing short of his
 
02:04:26.089 --> 02:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
historic and two years in so many ways
 
02:04:28.490 --> 02:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
could feel like 10 years because the of
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
where we were two years ago to where we
 
02:04:35.089 --> 02:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
are now is like night and day and if you
 
02:04:36.589 --> 02:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
can think back of what we went through
 
02:04:39.229 --> 02:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
starting two years ago so many things
 
02:04:42.470 --> 02:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
happened so many things uh changed so
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
many historic events happened and I
 
02:04:47.330 --> 02:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
think anyone that is was here present
 
02:04:49.850 --> 02:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
who is not coming back and those that
 
02:04:51.890 --> 02:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
are coming back need to understand this
 
02:04:55.010 --> 02:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
was truly a historic period in time for
 
02:04:57.169 --> 02:04:57.179 align:start position:0%
being a legislator in the state of New
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%

minority party the whole nine yards this
 
02:05:09.050 --> 02:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
has truly been a whirlwind of just a
 
02:05:10.609 --> 02:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
mixed bag of a lot of things that we had
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%

02:05:16.250 --> 02:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
