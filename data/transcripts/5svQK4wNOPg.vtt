00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
right i open the committee of conference
 
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
on uh house bill 1099
 
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.590 align:start position:0%
on uh house bill 1099
with

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh amendments and
 
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
this as it's presented to us
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
has four parts to it the original bill
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
and then three add-ons and what i'd like
 
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
to do is discuss briefly each one of
 
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
those four sections
 
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
get a sense of where we are and then
 
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
come back and
 
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
decide what we want to do
 
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
so the first section you'll see is
 
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
relative to medical freedom in
 
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.469 align:start position:0%
relative to medical freedom in
immunizations

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
and clarifies that no person shall be
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
required to receive a covet 19
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
vaccination in order to receive benefits
 
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
or services from dhhs
 
00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
the health and human services committee
 
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.390 align:start position:0%
the health and human services committee
even

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
even
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
amended this section
 
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
but i'm checking that right now okay
 
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.950 align:start position:0%
but i'm checking that right now okay
and

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
all right mata or mr chair thank you um
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay i'm i'm just i'm looking at the
 
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
matrix and i think this is going to be
 
00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
very helpful once i figure out how to
 
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
read it
 
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.950 align:start position:0%
read it
uh

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the page that was also
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
wednesday go ahead yeah the bottom of
 
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
the page one communicable disease and
 
00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
then it runs onto the second page what
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
what is that supposed to represent it
 
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
was that to represent an amendment that
 
00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
both the house and the senate had
 
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
specifically to 1099 or to another bill
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
i believe it shows that we were in
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
agreement on that but
 
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.150 align:start position:0%
agreement on that but
um

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
is that relative to 1099 or a different
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill i think to 1099 but the word i got
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
republican leader of the house is this
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
is moot
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
because um
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's already been handled in other
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that's passed so the first
 
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
thing is really
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
and in other words if we kill it we're
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
not really killing anything is the word
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
hunt we're looking at the first part you
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
did you find what you were looking for
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
i was showing you the introduced thing
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the house pass
 
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
and the senate that the provisions
 
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
people's thoughts on
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
section one here i i
 
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
i could see myself concurring on that i
 
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.830 align:start position:0%
i could see myself concurring on that i
i

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
my memory is not great but i think that
 
00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
this may have gone through division
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
three and i had a chance to work with
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
representative cushman to to make some
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
adjustments that the senate bought off
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
on and
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
once again republican leaders said that
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
it was not needed because it is
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
now been handled elsewhere which
 
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
to me never means kill it it just means
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
we we really mean it now because we said
 
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
it twice
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
just senator yeah just a question so was
 
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
it handled in another bill
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
this session or it's already an existing
 
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.949 align:start position:0%
this session or it's already an existing
law

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
seeing nothing further
 
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.350 align:start position:0%
seeing nothing further
section

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.630 align:start position:0%
section
two

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
is about the special supplemental
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
nutrition program for work farmers
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
market and so on
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative edwards we were talking
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
about this beforehand
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes yes mr chair i
 
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.190 align:start position:0%
uh yes yes mr chair i
um

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
this did come to division three and i
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
did have an opportunity to talk to the
 
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.470 align:start position:0%
did have an opportunity to talk to the
advocate

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
or lobbyist for this
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
and what
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
we concluded from that conversation i
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
think i may have talked to you also
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
senator whitley
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
was that the 300 000 couldn't be spent
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
anyways because
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh the money can only be paid out july 1
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
to september 1 something like that and
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
there was just no way in this initial
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
year that they were going to be able to
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
get the program up and running
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
and so what i
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
had been willing to do in division three
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
but i i guess i dropped the ball which
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
is on a workload issue i don't know what
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
it was but was uh to go ahead and seed
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
the program with like 10 000 or 15 000
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
that would let um the department go
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
forward with things like rfp rfi
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
and and also
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
in order to execute the program they
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
have to have vouchers
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
and the vouchers get handed out and so
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
they need to print the vouchers so i
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to give them enough money to get
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
sort of the administrative
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
overhead taken care of but it didn't
 
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%
need anywhere near 300
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
000. please
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
so i had a different understanding and i
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
don't know if someone from the
 
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.470 align:start position:0%
don't know if someone from the
department

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
is here
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
is the lisa from the department here
 
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.590 align:start position:0%
is the lisa from the department here
henry

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
henry
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
here john's here on the back
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
so my understanding when we came up with
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
this number we developed it so that
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
the coupon that people brought to the
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
farmers market was 30
 
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.829 align:start position:0%
farmers market was 30
because

00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
it's expensive to go to the farmer's
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
market and so you need to make the
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
coupon enough money so people will go
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
so i think we had some discussions
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative about the administrative
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
side of it and whether
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
they needed that much on the
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
administrative side but we do need
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
so i actually think i have a pretty good
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
memory on this which is rare
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
but what what i what i'm awfully sure of
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
is that they couldn't stand up the
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
program this year from july 1 to
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
september 1. so they didn't need 30
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
because they couldn't get it into the
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
marketplace so
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
but and and then if they were to start
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
this program with the
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
vouchers july 1 of next year
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
that's the next fiscal year that's the
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
next budget
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
so i was willing to seed it
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
and i i it was either 10 000 or 15 000
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
because they just didn't need they
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't spend the rest of it and july 1
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
is the new fiscal year anyways so
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
but but mr williams has a perfect memory
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
up for the record john williams
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
legislative director for health and
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
human services and i'm actually
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
fortunate uh the department doesn't have
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
anyone here today to respond to your
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
questions and to um
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
and to reflect uh your memory of this
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
particular bill but i do want to say to
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
um to the bill that department was
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
supportive and supports the underlying
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
bill and we do have representatives who
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
could answer your questions here from
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
the audience so uh chairman pearson if
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
they could be allowed to come up they
 
00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:22.839 align:start position:0%
can address your questions a team to the
 
00:12:22.839 --> 00:12:24.550 align:start position:0%
can address your questions a team to the
front

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
front
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify they're they're not
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
with the department but they're very
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
good morning i'm tiffany dodier from new
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire hunger solutions and i've had
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
some conversations with uh rep edwards
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
and and senator whitley and um also lisa
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
sirois at the department so last
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
conversation that we had um
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
lisa cervois was that
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
the seed money would be much appreciated
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
and that i can't speak to exactly if
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to spend the
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
money this year but the the
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
the likelihood of being able to get the
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
program up and running this year would
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
be a challenge for the department so not
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
speaking for the department this is
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
again third person conversation so um i
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
think that that they would be completely
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
happy with with seed money as well
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
such as the seed money as representative
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
edwards may have mentioned
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
um i can't speak to the exact amount i
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
know yeah i know i think that her and i
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
had spoken more around the 30 000 but i
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
but it would be quite difficult to get
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
the whole program up and running in six
 
00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:32.470 align:start position:0%
the whole program up and running in six
weeks

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
correct or actually it'll be less than
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
six weeks because this has to pass house
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
hi good morning for the record my name
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
is rebecca boykovsky i'm the kids count
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
policy director in futures and i've been
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
working with tiffany and
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
our state partners on this and i just
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
want to concur with that understanding
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
around the challenges of implementing
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
but how important the seed money really
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
senator yeah so
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that that's helpful um
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
the other piece to it was that
 
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.790 align:start position:0%
the other piece to it was that
the

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the department
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
had already made the request to the
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
federal government or sort of let the
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
federal government know so they're ready
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
to go as my understanding
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
um ready to go
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
they have the approval from the federal
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
they have the yes they have the approval
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
from the federal government the dates
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
are fuzzy to me about i think i think
 
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
that they can implement it in the next
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
um the next summer and still use the
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
same plan and that's that would be fine
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
i think the plan is approved for either
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
this year or next year and i think
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
they've already had some communication
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up thank you so
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
you may have heard
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
in the news that there's a shortage of
 
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
infant formula
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
and the vast majority of people who are
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
having trouble accessing the formula are
 
00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.750 align:start position:0%
having trouble accessing the formula are
wic

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
wic
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
recipients is that your understanding
 
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.509 align:start position:0%
recipients is that your understanding
yes

00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and so i i certainly understand the
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
need to be fiscally responsible i just
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
want to make sure if there is any chance
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
we can get this going that we have give
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
so maybe some somewhere between 300
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
thousand is the right number i just it's
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
also three hundred thousand dollars is
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
budget dust particularly when we're
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
talking about you know hungry babies and
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
hungry children and so you know i'm
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
wondering if we can come up if you had
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
any thoughts about a middle ground on
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
the number
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'd be really hesitant to speak on on
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
behalf of the department i'm not sure if
 
00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:30.710 align:start position:0%
behalf of the department i'm not sure if
you

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
have any representative edwards
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify this this
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
we all care about babies
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
but this money this program is not going
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
to help a single mother
 
00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:44.629 align:start position:0%
to help a single mother
get

00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
a baby food as i understand it right
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
this is this is for the farmers markets
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
the free vegetables the tomatoes that
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
sort of thing this is not the baby
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
formula crisis right
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
or wrong can they can they go to a
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
farmer's market and buy baby formula
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
no um you can't buy baby formula if i
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
can speak i think
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
not speaking for senator whitley but i
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
think we're talking about alleviating
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
some of the financial burden um i think
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
that neither tiffany nor i should speak
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
to what the department can do
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that is vitally important
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
and it's a great program for our state
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
so if there is a middle ground between
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
what senator whitley is suggesting and
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
what you are suggesting representative
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
edwards as advocates we really implore
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
you to consider that
 
00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:32.629 align:start position:0%
you to consider that
follow

00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
so this isn't just about fiscal
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility this is about
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
operational uh possibility this is the
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
the art of the doable here is to give
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
them the money to get ready for next
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
july because because as i understand it
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
these coupons need to be redeemed
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
within the july one and i forget if it
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
was september 1 or september 30
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
and if we fall outside of that deadline
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
then there they can't use the coupons in
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
in the current few months is
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
which is september 1 or september 30. i
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
september 30 i believe it is yes
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
so just to complete my thought
 
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.789 align:start position:0%
so just to complete my thought
um

00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
senator whitley i i like this program i
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
think you and i've worked on similar
 
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.630 align:start position:0%
think you and i've worked on similar
programs

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
and i i can assure you that from my
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
research and talking to people that if
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
we put seed money in for the
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
administrative overhead
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't have to it would you know 30
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
000 would be a lot but
 
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.110 align:start position:0%
000 would be a lot but
but

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
this isn't about being cheap this is
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
just about it takes time to stand up a
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
program and re reality should
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
interject itself into what we're doing
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and and i definitely
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate that my only hesitation it's
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
two things one it's possible that the
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
department can get going and i and i
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
know well i do know that because
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
there are we already have snap farmers
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
market program and so we already have a
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
vendor that does that now and so that
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
same vendor could just do it for wic
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
so we have a vendor that could do it so
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
my proposal would be at 100 000 um and
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
that that would give us enough if if
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
they were able to stand it up by
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
september right then there would be
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
money available if people were able to
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
and again i'm just i'm just a no at any
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
amount over 30 000 because i i really
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
did try to research this and understand
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
it because i i i want to respect you and
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
when it came to my committee i wanted to
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
make sure i knew what i was talking
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
about and so i'm i'm i'm trying to
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
respect your position without while
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
respecting the reality of what it takes
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
to get a program like this up and
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
operational 30 000 is the most i could
 
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.470 align:start position:0%
operational 30 000 is the most i could
go

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
senator greg
 
00:19:03.679 --> 00:19:05.190 align:start position:0%
senator greg
well

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.230 align:start position:0%
well
certainly

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable amount and the senate
 
00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:21.909 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable amount and the senate
can

00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
support that i believe
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
that you know we not only have to look
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
at the amount of time
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
can we
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
you know get the coupons out for this
 
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.750 align:start position:0%
you know get the coupons out for this
year

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.549 align:start position:0%
year
can

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
well i understand
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative edwards you say no
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
but i think that there are a lot of
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
motivated people out there who want to
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
do the right thing
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
for these mothers and children
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
and giving them the assets that they
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
need to do that
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
i believe is the right thing to do
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
and so my opinion
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
and from the nods that i've gotten from
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
my colleagues
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh that the senate position would be
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
that the hundred thousand dollars is the
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
the senator attributed this statement to
 
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.990 align:start position:0%
the senator attributed this statement to
me

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
but i'm passing on what i've been told
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
by the people who would run this program
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
they can't get the rfis they can't get
 
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
the coupons they can't get the marketing
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
out they can't hit
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
september 30th this year but they can
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
prepare and get ready for july one of
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
next year so uh it that's not me that's
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
the research and the people who i talk
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
to about it
 
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.789 align:start position:0%
to about it
okay

00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
again representative hunt how high would
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
you go starting with zero and going to
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
i would uh support my fellow
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative when he makes a
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation because he knows more
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
they can't spend all the 30 anyway
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
the other option is to actually hold
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
just for a little bit on this and
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
actually get lisa roy you know ask if
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
she can come and really give us some
 
00:21:11.919 --> 00:21:13.070 align:start position:0%
she can come and really give us some
confirmation

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
confirmation
 
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.470 align:start position:0%
confirmation
[Music]

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
we have other things to talk about maybe
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
she could well we do but
 
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.590 align:start position:0%
she could well we do but
um

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not ready to budge above 30 000
 
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.830 align:start position:0%
i'm not ready to budge above 30 000
either

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
so that's we'll come back to that after
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
we've had a minute to chew on it i mean
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
i think the program is a good one but
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
for right now
 
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.350 align:start position:0%
for right now
okay

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
item next in your printout it is page
 
00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:40.470 align:start position:0%
item next in your printout it is page
three

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
um it's another senate add-on its
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
association health plans
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
pilot program
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
yes let me speak to that
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
so um this uh piece of legislation uh
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
was in my committee commerce committee
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
and um i think it was almost unanimously
 
00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:06.789 align:start position:0%
and um i think it was almost unanimously
uh

00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
voted inexpedient
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.630 align:start position:0%
and uh
in

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
for several reasons one is that uh we
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
already have a statute similar in place
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
to allow alliances to be formed
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
but more importantly the idea of
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
limiting it i mean it turned to turn the
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
whole alliance thing upside down
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
because it had a limited amount of
 
00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:30.070 align:start position:0%
because it had a limited amount of
members

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
which is only has the potential of
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
creating an adverse selection process
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
and even more bizarre was that it was a
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
pilot program because
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
if you're going to put one of these
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
together it costs money to create it
 
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.430 align:start position:0%
together it costs money to create it
and

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
so why would anybody put money in if
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that it would
 
00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:49.909 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that it would
continue

00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:50.710 align:start position:0%
continue
so

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why the commerce
 
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.789 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why the commerce
committee

00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
voted it down and and we just
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why it would reappear
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
today in this bill
 
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.590 align:start position:0%
today in this bill
senator

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.470 align:start position:0%
senator
so

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
this was senator richard's bill i've
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
forgotten the number maybe
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
you remember the numbers um i don't know
 
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
why we wouldn't do it
 
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.110 align:start position:0%
why we wouldn't do it
it

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me for a thousand
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
um insured lives
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
it's a small number in the overall
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
scheme of things it would help us answer
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
you know questions potentially as to
 
00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:31.590 align:start position:0%
you know questions potentially as to
whether

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
associated health plans would have some
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
merit in new hampshire
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
you may be right there may be no takers
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
we've had this conversation
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
i don't know why we wouldn't do it so i
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
think the senate wants to
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
have this deal because we already have
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
that one we already have a lot right but
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
i understand the miwa law but
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
um it hasn't happened this
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
is affirmative in that the department of
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
insurance would um
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
develop and implement a pilot program
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
that's the difference
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
if there are no takers there are no
 
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.750 align:start position:0%
if there are no takers there are no
takers

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
takers
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
right but
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
it it defies
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
the reason why there's no takers
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
with even the meal outlaws in terms of
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
getting that pulling that together and
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
making it happen
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
and as uh i will always remember
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
senator ray white's comment is that you
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
can't it can't be viable
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
given that there the risk of someone
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
having a a cancer or having you know had
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
adverse you know
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
somebody in the plan that you needed a
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
minimum of three thousand lies and
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why none of these
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
other he was none of these you know the
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
the alliance forget what we call the
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
other program that has never gotten
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
gotten off the ground
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
and it was because you couldn't
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
the risk is too great unless you really
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
have a critical mass to make it viable
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
so you're you're pointing out that it
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened and i'm saying is it
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened because
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's not economically rational
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
and so to put this on the books just to
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
have it on the books
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
to waste the insurance department's time
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
trying to put a program together and
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
make other insurance companies pay for
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
it right because it's how
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
it works for the insurance department to
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know for just something to be on the
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
books is is wasting everybody's time nor
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
and it's also giving the false
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
impression that uh this opportunity
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
exists you know and when when in reality
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
it's never going to happen when we
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
already have a statute well if
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i might if you're correct
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
that nobody's going to bid on it it is
 
00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.630 align:start position:0%
that nobody's going to bid on it it is
repealed

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.029 align:start position:0%
repealed
um

00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
on july 1 of 2025 so i again i see
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely no harm
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
with the affirmative declaration that
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
the department should try to go forward
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
with it so i
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
since we've held on section
 
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.950 align:start position:0%
since we've held on section
three

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
i think the senate would ask we hold on
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
oh so what do we mean by hold on what
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
are we holding on until continue to
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
discuss it okay right we won't
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
unilaterally eliminate it yet
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
i don't have senate bill 286 so
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
therefore i don't have the fiscal note
 
00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.190 align:start position:0%
therefore i don't have the fiscal note
uh

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
with me
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
i don't remember it happening
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
i don't think it had a fiscal note but
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
i'll look it up uh was it senate bill
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
286. 286 the side by side far right
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
my computer turned on it look
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
so technically
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of fiscal note
 
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:15.190 align:start position:0%
in terms of fiscal note
um

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:15.990 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's i'll just read a couple of things
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
in it the insurance department indicated
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
it can assume the responsibilities
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
associated with this bill within its
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
existing infrastructure with no impact
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
to the operating fund where the program
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
is limited to a thousand participants
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
the department assumes
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
the impact on premium tax if any will be
 
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.990 align:start position:0%
the impact on premium tax if any will be
small

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
and in terms of appropriations there's
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
none in terms of revenue indeterminable
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
and expenditures zero
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
i was gonna about to say that's what i
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
would predict the fn would say
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
no it's not it's you know in terms of
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
the department's energy it's really
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
it's just gonna sit there anyways
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
because they know they know too they
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
know better than i do that
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
this is never going to be used no one's
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
ever going to pull this off
 
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.070 align:start position:0%
ever going to pull this off
and

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
i would say that i've taken the position
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
many times in the commerce committee
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
that if we actually had somebody coming
 
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.149 align:start position:0%
that if we actually had somebody coming
forward

00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
viably wants
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
a legislation when even comes to the
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
idea of buying health insurance across
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
state lines i say show me that one
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
insurance company who wants to sell it
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
across state lines show me somebody who
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
really is going to put this plan
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
together that has a viable market plan
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know has a plan to make it happen
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
then then the commerce committee would
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely jump with joy and pass it but
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
at this point you know we've we've
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
already been down this path so many
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
times we know
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
not reality
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
so you'll be a no
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
i would be a no okay
 
00:28:54.159 --> 00:28:54.950 align:start position:0%
i would be a no okay
and

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
having studied medical studies a little
 
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.389 align:start position:0%
having studied medical studies a little
bit

00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
and having listened to some conversation
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
about this i would agree that a thousand
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
participants is
 
00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:06.630 align:start position:0%
participants is
unwise

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
unwise
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
it's too small
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
so that'd be a no as well so i think
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
and the last section is
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
it starts on the bottom of page three at
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh day number seven
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
medicaid enhancement for children and
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
anyone wish to kick that one off
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
senator yes so this is something that um
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
both the senate health and human
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
services and the how you know house
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
really looked at a lot there was a lot
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
of discussion i know house finance also
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
looked at it a lot and got a lot of
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
testimony on it so it's
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
it is incredibly important right now
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
because it's this opportunity to extend
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
coverage in the medicaid program for
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
women from 60 days postpartum to one
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
year postpartum and so we know that
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.470 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
um

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
data and
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
evidence to show that you know if we can
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
keep moms healthy and keep them healthy
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
by uh affording them coverage we're also
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
keeping babies healthy and so you know
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
for a whole host of
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
reasons access to coverage is incredibly
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
important for women postpartum so it's
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
an opportunity from the federal
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
government i think we really have to
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
take advantage of
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
could i could the chair ask
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative webber to do a little
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
look up to see how our committee did
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
when this bill came to us please thank
 
00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:35.919 align:start position:0%
you representative edwards
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:30:39.919 --> 00:30:41.510 align:start position:0%
i don't know
407.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
407.
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill yeah
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
of course she does yeah and i'm sorry
 
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.070 align:start position:0%
of course she does yeah and i'm sorry
for

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
i would like to know how the um health
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
and human services committee of the
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
i do remember that now yes
 
00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.750 align:start position:0%
i do remember that now yes
okay

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
and while you got that up would you
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
division three i think probably passed
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
at 7-0
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
i i'm thinking
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
so what happened is just what happened
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
yeah you attached house bill 1210
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
so you supported the program
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
that was representative lang's vaccine
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
bill which
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
had a lot of debate so
 
00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:38.149 align:start position:0%
had a lot of debate so
we

00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
didn't concur with that bill
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
and we
 
00:31:42.159 --> 00:31:43.669 align:start position:0%
and we
attached

00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
attached
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
the medicaid piece to this bill
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
that's what happened
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
so in summary
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the house position on
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
this is that the two relevant committees
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
heard it agreed with it it went to the
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
house floor and i believe we passed this
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh just like a week ago
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
is that there's a researcher back here
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
what what what was the house vote on
 
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:23.029 align:start position:0%
what what what was the house vote on
this

00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
so the house position is we passed this
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
through committee through committee
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
through the floor
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
i know from being married to a doctor
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
there's this
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
lack of coming in when you should have
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
mr orm is patient
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
because you didn't want to pay the copay
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
now it has gotten very expensive and you
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
feel like bleep
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
so pay me now pay me more later
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative edwards so so just to put
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
this in context uh there was there this
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
is only picking up an additional 10
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
months for a wedge of of uh clients or
 
00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:08.950 align:start position:0%
months for a wedge of of uh clients or
patients

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's those that are above
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
some percentage i think i i don't
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
remember it exactly maybe it was 140
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
percent of the federal poverty up until
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
298 percent or 296 percent something
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
under 300 percent and in that wedge
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
there was an estimate that that would
 
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.149 align:start position:0%
there was an estimate that that would
include

00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
570 approximately
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
women that wouldn't have otherwise been
 
00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.029 align:start position:0%
women that wouldn't have otherwise been
covered

00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
covered
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
and then i think i recall that we
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
anticipated about a quarter of them
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
would actually need the services and
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
we'd be spending more money so so um so
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not solving the world
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're not boiling the ocean we're just
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
trying to help a relatively limited
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
number of people
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
get the additional postpartum care so
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
i i think given the house position i i
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative hunt
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't have any problems
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
with supporting it but um
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
other than i guess it's this games we
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
have things getting moved around from
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
one bill to another it's a little
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
tiresome because i went through this on
 
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.550 align:start position:0%
tiresome because i went through this on
friday

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
friday
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
and um uh
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
before you go there
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
four of my bills
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
were taken
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
um under advisement by the house and a
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
lot of things added to it so john please
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.869 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
senator gray
 
00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:45.990 align:start position:0%
senator gray
i

00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
think that the house accepting the
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
senate's position
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay well working backwards then
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
starting with this one
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
we are all
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
both groups senate and house yes on
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
yeah we actually
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
decided to vote yeah okay
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
four and three i think there were some
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
trade-offs in mind here or something um
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
i think we could um accept something
 
00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.310 align:start position:0%
i think we could um accept something
between

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
30 and 100
 
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.270 align:start position:0%
30 and 100
so

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
here's what i'd suggest mr chair okay
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
why don't we
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
um i need to give some thought
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
with representative hunt to
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
the associated plan piece
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
um why don't you think about what you
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
could live with between 30 and
 
00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.790 align:start position:0%
could live with between 30 and
100

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
and we come back in a day or two okay
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
and now the pilot sorry
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
and three
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
and hold on free
 
00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:24.710 align:start position:0%
and hold on free
okay

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
back to
 
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.310 align:start position:0%
back to
one

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.150 align:start position:0%
one
the

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
no person shall be required to receive a
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
covet back to receive service from dhhs
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think any of us have any trouble
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
with that the question is do we need it
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
because we both passed it and we'll pass
 
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.710 align:start position:0%
because we both passed it and we'll pass
it

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's my plan if it's good once let's
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
do it twice but okay well actually third
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
time charles well that's charm then sir
 
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:50.950 align:start position:0%
time charles well that's charm then sir
yes

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
representative i i just want to go back
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
to the horse trading idea over a number
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
between 30 and 100 000.
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
i i swear to god the amount of money
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
that they need to get this program
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
started is is
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
less than 30
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
any more that we put in there
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
is one of two things is going to happen
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
one it's just not going to get spent
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
because they can't spend it that much on
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
getting the program started and getting
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
the coupons printed
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
or worse they spend it on something else
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
and it's wasted or at least it's not
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
authorized so i didn't i'm not like just
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
picking 30 000 out of the air
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh it
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
you know that that just seems to me to
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
be the the maximum reasonable amount
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
that we should go to but
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
we can take a couple days to think about
 
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.190 align:start position:0%
we can take a couple days to think about
it

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh and if i may miss chair
 
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.870 align:start position:0%
uh and if i may miss chair
uh

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
if we're gonna wait two days anyway
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh certainly that will give us time to
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
bolster our argument that the money can
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
be spent
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
and that we will would request that time
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that consult with the
 
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.109 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that consult with the
department

00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
and try to make it say win-win for the
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
well i have a 10
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
well it's 12.
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's 12. i have another one that's going
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
if a committee of conference meeting
 
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.150 align:start position:0%
if a committee of conference meeting
recesses

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
recesses
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
the reconvening time should be posted on
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
and is this not a committee of
 
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:57.190 align:start position:0%
and is this not a committee of
conference

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's not what i'm reading in front of
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
me that was sent to me the key thing to
 
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.750 align:start position:0%
me that was sent to me the key thing to
read

read
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%

although

01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
the signatures on the committee support
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%

conference on um house bill 1439
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
relative to health care facility
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
visitation policies and you should have
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
a side by side each one of us has a side
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
by side
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
and we are there's basically about three
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
or four items at issue and
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask
 
01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.470 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask
my

01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
policy committee vice chair
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative leon if she would
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
speak to those because you have
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
something prepared
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
there are four differences between the
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
house and senate version the largest is
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
the placement
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
in the patient bill of rights versus in
 
01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
the licensing statute i think that
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's something that the house is going
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
to accept moving to the patient bill of
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
rights because we need to move forward
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
on something here
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
additionally there's a documentation
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
need so the house viewed that it was
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
very important that if there was a
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
patient who was contraindicated for
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
visitors that there was actually a
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
patient specific reason for that
 
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
contraindication for visitors and as
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
such if there was a contraindication
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
something would already be charted and
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
it would make sense to
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
note that the patient
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
what had their visitors asked to leave
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
because they had a significant event
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
that contraindicated those visitors
 
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
that's something that we are willing to
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
set aside at this point because
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
we are more important we're
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
much more concerned about the two other
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
ones the first letting people know that
 
01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
we've heard their voice we've heard too
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
many people that didn't have access to
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
their loved ones and simply adding the
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
four words at the beginning of this
 
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
section on the patient bill of rights no
 
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
patient left alone
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
will be a nice touchstone for those
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
people who have
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
had a traumatic past two years this
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
trauma has been in the healthcare
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
facilities with our heroes that have
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
been working on the front lines it's
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
also been in our families and in our
 
01:19:21.679 --> 01:19:22.390 align:start position:0%
also been in our families and in our
community

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
and we need to come together um and and
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
heal this and move forward so um the
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
first part would be to replace
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
um the first section
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
and just add the words no patient left
 
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
alone right after xxi xxiii i
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:40.239 --> 01:19:41.430 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
right on page one of the side by side on
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
the senate side between the xxii and the
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
a we would add the words no patient left
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
alone and hopefully that is something
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
that we can all agree upon in order to
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
just understand where everyone is coming
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
from the other section is really a
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
de-escalation issue
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
there are conflicts over visitation
 
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
policies and the easiest way to calm a
 
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
conflict is to be able to hand something
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
to somebody in black and white and say
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
hear the rules we're not doing anything
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
different for you these are the rules to
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
keep people safe
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
please read through them let me know if
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
you have a problem and then we can
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
discuss it but the rules are written and
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
they are here
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
the house had
 
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
had said that we were going to place
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
both the patient bill of rights and the
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
written hospital policy on the wall of
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
patient treatment rooms
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
we don't really need to wallpaper the
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
rooms but we do need to make it very
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
clear that this information is available
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
so we have the language to
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
put a notif an informational sign in all
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
patient treatment rooms to make the
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
patients and visitors aware of the
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
contents of this
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
the section of the patient bill of
 
01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:52.709 align:start position:0%
the section of the patient bill of
rights

01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
oh sorry aware of the contents of the
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights and their right
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
to receive a current printed copy of the
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
written hospital visitation policies
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
upon request
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
this is a great way when somebody starts
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit agitated
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
you hand them a copy and say you'll be
 
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.270 align:start position:0%
you hand them a copy and say you'll be
back

01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
we we went through a lot of work on
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
senate bill 459 for de-escalation to
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
reduce workplace violence and i believe
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
that this would go hand-in-hand with
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
that so i believe that these are two
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
very important changes
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
but i think that they still
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
honor the request to move this to the
 
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
patient bill of rights and to not add
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
any documentation requirements to our
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
stressed health care system today
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
in talking with various members of the
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
house health and human services
 
01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.189 align:start position:0%
house health and human services
committee

01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
i was particularly
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
happy to hear from
 
01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:49.590 align:start position:0%
happy to hear from
dr

01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
dr
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
woods i used his title deliberately
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
retired i think president of new
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire medical society a hand surge
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
and so on and he thought there was merit
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
again not to wallpaper the room with all
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
the rules but to have the salient ones
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
posted in each room with a reference to
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
where they can be found online there
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
they are we're not hiding anything we're
 
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
not saying you got to go out and punch
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
up something on your computer but basic
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
things are there
 
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
i also recall we were told that oh the
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals are pretty compliant with
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
these things and my response whenever
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
i'm given that statement is then you
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
have nothing to fear if you're already
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
doing a good job now you get extra
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
credit because it's posted so
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
um i would agree certainly very much
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
with that um i know from being part-time
 
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
chief executive officer of a small
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
medical facility when a certain thing
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
happens it's important to document it
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
and if a patient is told you can't
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
do such and such
 
01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
regarding visitors or visitors told that
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
put it on the chart rather than relying
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
on somebody's memory
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
later on that this might or might not
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
have uh taken place again it's
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
that with the title of this is
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
de-escalation as i said in the house
 
01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.590 align:start position:0%
de-escalation as i said in the house
hearing

01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
being clergy i have 47 years i've been
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
in hospitals a lot visiting a lot of
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
people and for the most part they do a
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
wonderful job they do try to accommodate
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
there are occasions when visitors are
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
unruly and need
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
to be dealt with there are other times
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
when an overstressed staff occasionally
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
misses something that they should have
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
done for the most part things have run
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
incredibly well so i come to the
 
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
hospital visitation policy bill uh not
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
hostile at all to the hospital but very
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
much wanting to um just let people know
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
who are overstressed that you've been
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
heard you've been valued senators
 
01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.189 align:start position:0%
heard you've been valued senators
um

01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i would uh first
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
of all uh i really appreciate
 
01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.870 align:start position:0%
of all uh i really appreciate
the

01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
keeping this in the patient bill of
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
rights rather than going into licensure
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
actually in the patient bill of rights
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
it may actually have more clout
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
because the licensure body looks at
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
technical issues but in terms of
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive nature and compliance with
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
your own policies
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's where you get into accreditation
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
which actually has more clout than
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
licensure if you're not accredited if
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
you're not accredited by cms you're in
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
trouble as a hospital you're not viable
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
and they look to
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
being compliant with your patient bill
 
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
of rights um whereas it's only the state
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
with licensure that would be like
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
looking at if it were sitting in license
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
for so i really appreciate
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
that um recognition of where this is
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
going to have the most impact and where
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
it sits most
 
01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.030 align:start position:0%
it sits most
um

01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.870 align:start position:0%
um
comfortably

01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
comfortably
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
i think the no patient left alone act
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
um i
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
this to me
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
i understand where it comes from
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
but no frontline healthcare worker over
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
the last two years has
 
01:25:14.239 --> 01:25:15.110 align:start position:0%
the last two years has
ever

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
ever
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
what we're really trying to do is to
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that under all potential
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances unless there's some really
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh overweening reason why it can't
 
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.110 align:start position:0%
uh overweening reason why it can't
happen

01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
the patient should not be without their
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
loved ones with people who care about
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
them but this is so broad
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
that it's almost like no patient should
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
continue to be neglected
 
01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:44.629 align:start position:0%
continue to be neglected
and

01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
physician who's practiced for over 30
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
years hospital-based medicine
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
this really could be taken and i know
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's not meant to be but it could be
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
taken as being incredibly inflammatory
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
and offensive
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
so if we can rephrase it in a way that
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
really targets what the bill is trying
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
the word smithing is would need to be
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
done but
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
um i would prefer it to say
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
no patient without their loved ones
 
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.510 align:start position:0%
no
qualified

01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
competent physician nurse lna
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
would ever leave a patient alone in fact
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
in covid when there were these really
 
01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
tough provider issues and and visitation
 
01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:42.870 align:start position:0%
tough provider issues and and visitation
issues

01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
we had i mean the the visuals of cmc
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
where the the
 
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
people were the nurses were doing
 
01:26:53.189 --> 01:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
signage back and forth and with the
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
families who couldn't come in and making
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
sure their loved ones had that
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
this to me doesn't capture the
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
commitment on the part of the
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
workers in the hospitals
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
and how much they care deeply about the
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
patients and making sure that their
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
loved ones can be there
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
so if we can come up with different
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
language i have no problem re-inserting
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
this but i do have a problem with these
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
words because i think it
 
01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.070 align:start position:0%
words because i think it
it

01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
it's brought too broad
 
01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
in that it also could say
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
don't neglect patience which
 
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
does not happen and it actually would be
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
malpractice so we shouldn't be
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
having something in statute that uses
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
those words in my book and that
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
and i see lucy has her hands up uh but
 
01:27:42.639 --> 01:27:43.350 align:start position:0%
and i see lucy has her hands up uh but
the

01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:50.950 --> 01:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
i was concerned about is
 
01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
how we
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
let patients know i would prefer
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
a system where
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
patients are provided with information
 
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
on admission
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
that they can have with them you know
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
there is a packet most hospitals and
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
paulo or steve can help me with this
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
i know my hospital has a bi-fold packet
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
that has all the patient information in
 
01:28:14.639 --> 01:28:15.510 align:start position:0%
that has all the patient information in
it

01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
you could either have that bi-fold
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
packet that actually would have
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
visitation policy on it
 
01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
you know as a part of the printed packet
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
on the inside maybe that's very
 
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.110 align:start position:0%
on the inside maybe that's very
prominent

01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
prominent
 
01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
you could have that bifold packet that
 
01:28:33.670 --> 01:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
also showed where to go online for it
 
01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:34.790 align:start position:0%
also showed where to go online for it

01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
many and one thing i'd add to this but
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
because i think it's really a great idea
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
many patients don't know that every
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
hospital has a patient advocate
 
01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
so having how to access the patient
 
01:28:48.639 --> 01:28:50.149 align:start position:0%
so having how to access the patient
advocate

01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
in that same information packet that
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
would go with the patient to the room it
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
would give them how to do a daily update
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
on visitation the family would have
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
access to it
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
but it would again get away from the
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
the rooms
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
which actually can get into sanitation
 
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.189 align:start position:0%
which actually can get into sanitation
issues

01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
some of these rooms if you
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
they're very careful about
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
what they put where especially in a room
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
that has
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
ventilation to prevent say the spread of
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
covet or tb or other airborne diseases
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
so my preference would be to have
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
if you're going to have required notice
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
and you want to broaden it
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
let's use a vehicle that's already there
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
this packet that's given at the
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
beginning of every hospitalization i'd
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
need to ask paul and steve what they
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
thought of that but
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
it would just be expanding what's
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
already given to the patient by
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
virtually every hospital
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
and then it moves with the patient so it
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
sits at their bedside it's accessible
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
and it'll be something the nurse could
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
then print out and give to them if
 
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's any question
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
and also senator while you're up um the
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
fourth item would be the
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
reason for denial of a visitor
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
for medical or therapeutic
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
contraindication should be documented
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
documented in the patient's medical
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
record um that was something the
 
01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
original sponsor wanted what do you
 
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
think about that
 
01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.189 align:start position:0%
think about that
um

01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
well you know
 
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
we already document so much and i'm not
 
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
sure that's
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
the clinical record is really for the
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
clinical record it's not it's not for
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
that if
 
01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:43.110 align:start position:0%
that if
um

01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
i don't see that as being something that
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh is appropriate in the clinical record
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
um the only place i could see it
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
possibly going would be in the nurses
 
01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:56.870 align:start position:0%
possibly going would be in the nurses
notes

01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
notes
 
01:30:58.550 --> 01:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
but then it would get
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
kind of lost in those so i you know i i
 
01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:02.950 align:start position:0%
kind of lost in those so i you know i i
would

01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
in my world having worked with emrs
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
they're all different they all have
 
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
different templates
 
01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.030 align:start position:0%
different templates
um

01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
and if you are having to put in
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
visitation policy in your emr
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's yet another thing and if you ask
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
any health care professional
 
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
you know what the emr is for it's for
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
things that are clinically appropriate
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
for the patient so i would prefer to not
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
have it in the emr is there another
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
place where it could be documented
 
01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:36.230 align:start position:0%
there might be you know
 
01:31:36.230 --> 01:31:37.669 align:start position:0%
there might be you know
[Music]

01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if there might be some
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
middle ground if you feel very strongly
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
on it that
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
patient's request or at the discretion
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
of the nurse rather than having it
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
happen every single time
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
that if a patient requested it it could
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
be put in the nurse's notes
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
the reason for it
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
but i think of it as one more thing we
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
have to document and i don't know
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
why it would be clinically necessary or
 
01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:15.430 align:start position:0%
why it would be clinically necessary or
appropriate

01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
and i also don't really know
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
what's going to be what that information
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
is going to be used for
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
in the future so
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
my guess would be if there is an issue
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
understood we already have a mechanism
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
for that if you look at
 
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
the uh and paulo or steve could probably
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
explain this or um
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know anybody from the hospitals
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
could explain
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
this role of the patient advocate when
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
we do have an issue we have people in
 
01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.550 align:start position:0%
we do have an issue we have people in
mind

01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
in my hospital we have somebody who'll
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
come up interview the patient and then
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
we'll start
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh an actual file that would track with
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
that patient but it doesn't go into the
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
medical record it goes into something
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:00.870 align:start position:0%
that is
uh

01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know legal that's accessible and
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
it's a document that goes along with the
 
01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
patient advocate
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
so but to
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
have an every time re you know
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
documentation of something that
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
likely will
 
01:33:15.679 --> 01:33:16.550 align:start position:0%
likely will
never

01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
never
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
be needed but if it is needed we have a
 
01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
mechanism all ready to document that
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
through the patient advocate program
 
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
and i believe that's a requirement of
 
01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.070 align:start position:0%
and i believe that's a requirement of
cms

01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
cms
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
or accreditation that you have to have a
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
department of patient advocate in every
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
hospital is that correct
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
or do you know
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
okay every hospital i've ever worked in
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
has had that role
 
01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.430 align:start position:0%
has had that role
um

01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
so that might be a better place for this
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
and that could also be explained in that
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
initial packet that we go out
 
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
senator bradley this is the opening
 
01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
salvo here
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
senator bradley
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
well i i agree with senator sherman i'm
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
glad that this is staying in the patient
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
bill of rights in terms of the emergency
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
medical records
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
i have the same concern that
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
senator sherman has
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
from a slightly different perspective i
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
guess i think we all know
 
01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:16.629 align:start position:0%
guess i think we all know
that

01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
just the amount of hours that
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
staff is having to work now
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
asking to do one more thing
 
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
um undermines patient care
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
when there ought to be whether it's
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
through the patient advocate or not um
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
some other way of doing it than
 
01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:35.669 align:start position:0%
some other way of doing it than
having

01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:34:35.679 --> 01:34:36.709 align:start position:0%
having
um

01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
nurses or whomever always document in
 
01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:41.350 align:start position:0%
nurses or whomever always document in
emr

01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
emr
 
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
this at a time that we're having a hard
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
time hiring people so
 
01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:47.270 align:start position:0%
time hiring people so
i

01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
would be opposed to doing it in the form
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
and of the other three items we're
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
looking at the title the build sponsor
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
wanted it no patient left alone act i'm
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
sure wordsmiths in the room
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
have a great alternative in fact i think
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call on representative
 
01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:23.270 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call on representative
weber

01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
that is the important thing
 
01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:27.189 align:start position:0%
that is the important thing
and

01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
obviously i think
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
we don't want to imply that they're
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
abandoned we want
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
them to have the best support
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
i put down patient visitation act but i
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
senator bradley that okay with you
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
senate patient support act
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
again i think
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
senator sherman and i work closely and
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
carefully with
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
the hospital association i'd want them
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
to look at any proposed language change
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
i mean these are their buildings
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
and the stress upon our
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
medical workers and our hospitals as
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
institutions has been
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
significant over the last couple of
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
years and so i think
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
we're not out thinking them
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important that they
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
look at this language and get back to us
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
i mean i would just note that the
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
sheet that
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
um representative leon
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
gave me with the exception of the title
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
the language is identical so
 
01:36:36.719 --> 01:36:38.709 align:start position:0%
the language is identical so
um

01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
page three uh senator bradley under um
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
information that is posted the question
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
as to whether the policy should be
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
online only
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
or should be posted
 
01:36:56.639 --> 01:36:57.990 align:start position:0%
or should be posted
and

01:36:57.990 --> 01:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
senator sherman
 
01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:00.870 align:start position:0%
senator sherman
gave

01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
gave
 
01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:02.149 align:start position:0%
gave
another

01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
yeah no i would agree with senator
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
sherman look i was told
 
01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:06.629 align:start position:0%
sherman look i was told
that

01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes these visitation policies
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
during cove would change multiple times
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
in a short period of time so
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
again whether i think senator sherman
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
brought up a good point about sanitation
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
i go back to
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
you know the actual workers being over
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
stressed were
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're being asked to do more with less
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
it seems like if we can refer people to
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
an updated policy change on a website or
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
hand them a piece of paper
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
that hasn't updated then you're not
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
having to
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know go through large hospitals
 
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
re-paper every room it just doesn't make
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
any sense to me
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
okay we've i've heard from three let me
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
weigh in a little bit here
 
01:37:56.159 --> 01:37:57.030 align:start position:0%
weigh in a little bit here
um

01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
it sounds like do we have consensus on
 
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
patient support act as the name
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
i love that name
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay so we're good on that one
 
01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:09.109 align:start position:0%
okay so we're good on that one
um

01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
well again again
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
i want
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
i mean we can tentatively
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
say we're okay
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
but i don't think myself i'm not signing
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
off on anything until the actual
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
language has been reviewed by you know
 
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
the people that run the 26
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals i'll be talking we'll be
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
talking and listening in a minute
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at us
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
we seem to
 
01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.790 align:start position:0%
we seem to
agree

01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
agree
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
that something should be documented
 
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.590 align:start position:0%
that something should be documented
somewhere

01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
in case there's a refusal
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
and a refusal
 
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
that could be escalating
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
and a refusal that could lead to a
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
having been asked on a couple of
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
occasions as a clergyman visiting a
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
hospital information about what went
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
down i know what went down and what i
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
said i saw was written down somewhere
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
and i think that was to protect numerous
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
not just the patient the visitor but the
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
hospital too
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
so we are looking at where is the best
 
01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:20.550 align:start position:0%
so we are looking at where is the best
place

01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
for that i think it would be helpful to
 
01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:24.629 align:start position:0%
for that i think it would be helpful to
again

01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
talk to the hospitals before we move
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
forward with this i feel very strongly
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
the electronic medical record is not the
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate place
 
01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
this is not a clinic i don't want to
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
minimize the therapeutic benefit of
 
01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.350 align:start position:0%
minimize the therapeutic benefit of
having

01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
family clergy and visitors it's really
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
important but it
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
this kind of legal documentation
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
i don't believe has any place in the emr
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
and just like senator bradley said it's
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
one more thing
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
on every patient
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
that they have to document on the other
 
01:39:59.119 --> 01:39:59.990 align:start position:0%
that they have to document on the other
hand

01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
i would defer to the hospitals do they
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
already have a mechanism
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
for when there is an issue with a
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
patient or with visitation or any issue
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
where do they already put that
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of their hospital documentation
 
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
i think that's what we need to get at
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
and if it already exists
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
i don't want to reinvent the wheel and
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
put that also in statute if there
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
already is a place for them to do that
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
i would leave that alone
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
the chair would like to call up miss
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
minihan and mr
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
rahern so we can uh
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
ask you these questions directly and
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
so i'll walk you through what i just
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
walked ourselves
 
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
as you know there's a back story there's
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of back stories behind this bill
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
and waving off certain parts
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
isn't can be inflammatory and i don't
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
want that i don't want it in my center
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
and believe me we've had conversations
 
01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:09.590 align:start position:0%
and believe me we've had conversations
with

01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
our staff as to maybe it's a little bit
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
more work maybe it's a pain in the neck
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
maybe the patient is a pain in the neck
 
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to defuse things here at the
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
same time i don't want
 
01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:20.470 align:start position:0%
same time i don't want
to

01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
over burden unnecessarily so
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
patient support act
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
it seems to be in some form quite
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
important to people
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative um for the
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
record paula manhan um for the hospital
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
association ann
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
steven hospital association
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
and you know with respect to patient
 
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
support act i i agree with senator
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
sherman um sort of the notion of leave
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
no patient alone
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
signals something that we're not doing
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
we're not leaving our patients alone and
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's not what this is about so patient
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
support act i don't have any real issues
 
01:41:59.350 --> 01:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
with um i mean this is in the patient's
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
bill of rights um so it's all about
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
patient's support um so i i don't think
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
i have
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
a real concern about that um i'm not
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
overly con
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
certain that it's necessary but if
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
there's a belief that that's
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh an important point and i understand
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
the importance of visitation nobody
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
needs to
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
convince me about the importance of that
 
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
but at the same time we have to
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
recognize that you know there are times
 
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
when we can't always do exactly
 
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
everything that we would like
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
to ensure the health and safety of our
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
patients our staff and our communities
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
and and unfortunately you know that
 
01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
tension um certainly um you know ran
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
headlong into one another um during this
 
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
period and i understand that um but i
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
think again what we're trying to do is
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we can
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
have patients visited by their families
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
and loved ones in the best way possible
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
in the safest way possible but as we've
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
said there are times when
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
we will need some flexibility um to to
 
01:43:05.590 --> 01:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
ensure the health and safety of our
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
patients and our staff
 
01:43:09.669 --> 01:43:09.679 align:start position:0%
and our visitors and and we believe that
 
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know certainly the the senate uh
 
01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
language comes much closer to that um so
 
01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
as it relates to patients uh safety act
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh patient support support i'm i'm i'm
 
01:43:22.950 --> 01:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'm okay okay senator sherman you want
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
to jump in on this yeah i just wanted to
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
ask a question you know
 
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
jumping forward can i ask about the emr
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
question i'd like to take it in order
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay i'll wait but hold that thought um
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
the second item is it should go
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh where should it go um
 
01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
patient bill of rights
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
did we like
 
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
yes the patient bill of rights works we
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
like that so we're in agreement on that
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's where it should be placed in the
 
01:43:51.990 --> 01:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
law okay so we're down to two and we're
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
two for two
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
and we're encouraged
 
01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:56.229 align:start position:0%
and we're encouraged
now

01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:43:56.239 --> 01:43:57.510 align:start position:0%
now
um

01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
reason for denial of a visitor i know
 
01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
from living with this daily that we've
 
01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:03.430 align:start position:0%
from living with this daily that we've
had

01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
occasions that were untoward
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
and we wrote it down somewhere
 
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
and i think emr is probably not the
 
01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
place i wish i'd asked my wife where do
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
we put that information but we put it
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere so where would be the best
 
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
place for a documentation of this
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
i guess our concern is and i think
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
senator sherman um touched on it as did
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
senator bradley we need flexibility and
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
i think i have been consistent
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire process dealing
 
01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
with this bill hospitals need
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility what exeter hospital has
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
might be very different than what
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock has versus a small
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
critical access hospital
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
in wolfeboro so that's our concern is i
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
don't think honestly it needs to be here
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
because it needs to be in statute
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
because they're already doing that
 
01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:55.270 align:start position:0%
because they're already doing that
so

01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:56.229 align:start position:0%
so
we

01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
to put it in statute we will need to go
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
back to find out what it would be called
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
but i think senator sherman made another
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
good point that they have patient
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
advocates i mean i have worked with
 
01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:10.159 align:start position:0%
hospitals um when there are issues that
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
they do have a patient advocate that
 
01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
gets involved um and they help with that
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
whole entire process so again to be
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
prescriptive is a problem um because
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
they they um they need that flexibility
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
because not every hospital um functions
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
dr sherman so if we just walk through
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
um the first
 
01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:36.629 align:start position:0%
um the first
iteration

01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0%
iteration
 
01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
we have to document
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
why there's a denial
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
in the heat of covid when things were at
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
their worst or even
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
last november when we were with the
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
delta surge
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
we had blanket policies across
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
the entire hospital no visitors i don't
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
know if we did that back i think we did
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
that both times but certainly in the
 
01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
height of the pandemic
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
about a year and a half ago
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
there were no visitors allowed in my
 
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
hospital 104
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
or over 100 beds
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
and we were surging so we had probably
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
100 130 patients
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
that would have meant that the nurse
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
would have had to write in every emr
 
01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.270 align:start position:0%
would have had to write in every emr
dead

01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
dead
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
the reason for denial is
 
01:46:23.189 --> 01:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
this is cdc
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
guidelines this is coming from the dhhs
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
that to me is unworkable
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
putting it in
 
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.590 --> 01:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
what would be something short of that if
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
there's a dispute well first of all we
 
01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
know that you all have documentation of
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
your hospital visitation policies like
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
that it's it's in the record of the
 
01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:47.270 align:start position:0%
that it's it's in the record of the
hospital

01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
so if there were any litigation which
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
has been brought up the hospital has the
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
records and the justification for their
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
hospital their hospital-wide policy
 
01:46:56.719 --> 01:46:57.750 align:start position:0%
hospital their hospital-wide policy
again

01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
no specific patient-based documentation
 
01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:02.070 align:start position:0%
no specific patient-based documentation
needed

01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
then you get down to the specific
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
patient based problems
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
when those disputes arise or if there's
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
an incident
 
01:47:12.390 --> 01:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
part of that is what we're trying to get
 
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
at with workforce safety
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare workforce safety and
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i will remind this body
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
the uh compulsory nature of the
 
01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
commission and of reporting was removed
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
by the house
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:29.270 align:start position:0%
you know that
that

01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
we had coming from the senate we had
 
01:47:31.119 --> 01:47:32.149 align:start position:0%
we had coming from the senate we had
that

01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
every hospital had to participate and
 
01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
that was removed by the house i believe
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
in the final version so it becomes more
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
voluntary i i may be incorrect but that
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
was something that came up and that's
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
not really so important as much as what
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here is make sure
 
01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
that if there is an individual
 
01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:50.950 align:start position:0%
that if there is an individual
issue

01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
where do you find documentation of that
 
01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:54.790 align:start position:0%
where do you find documentation of that
issue

01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
and i would propose
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
put that off
 
01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
of this bill not included in this for
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
two reasons number one
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
we have the hospital association sitting
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
here saying this is something that the
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
legislature would like to make sure
 
01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
is somewhere in the documentation of the
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
hospital and your homework assignment
 
01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.229 align:start position:0%
hospital and your homework assignment
for

01:48:20.229 --> 01:48:20.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
so we don't end up having to put it in
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
statute is to find out where that is
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
make sure it's uniform across all the
 
01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
hospitals i suspect that that is part of
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
your accreditation process and that
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
having an ability for a patient to bring
 
01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
a concern forward and have that
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
documented as part of accreditation
 
01:48:39.189 --> 01:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
because i served on the regulatory
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
committees my hospitals
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we need to put in
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
statute especially if it already exists
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
and i do believe for the reasons i've
 
01:48:50.229 --> 01:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
already stated that the emr is the wrong
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
place for it
 
01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:53.510 align:start position:0%
place for it
um

01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
sorry yes yes
 
01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
sorry um i would agree i also um we look
 
01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
at it there are always exceptions again
 
01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:01.830 align:start position:0%
at it there are always exceptions again
for

01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
in the case of labor and delivery in the
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
case of end of life in the case of a
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
child hospitals were able to make
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
accommodations when appropriate but
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
again this was on a case-by-case basis
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
and you can't legislate that um that's
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
what's very difficult
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
but that is what the conditions of
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
participation what
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
cms and the joint commission and dmv
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
require is that they have the documented
 
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
policy so like you said where it's the
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
80 20 rule it's almost like the you know
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
99 1 rule that the exceptions um will if
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
we put this in the patient bill of
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
rights i think that could cause um some
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
comp confusion so
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call in representative leon
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
on this uh thank you mr chairman um i do
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
think that there's some misunderstanding
 
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
about the um about this section here
 
01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:52.870 align:start position:0%
about the um about this section here
because

01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
it states that when visitors are
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
non-compliant with written hospital
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
policy that they can be denied so that
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
is separate than anything that would
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
require documentation because if we have
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
a blanket ban on visiting visitors
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's already covered separately by
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
section d
 
01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
the documentation is only for an
 
01:50:10.239 --> 01:50:11.830 align:start position:0%
the documentation is only for an
individualized

01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
individualized
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
medical or therapeutic contraindication
 
01:50:15.589 --> 01:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
if it's something that's more general to
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
the hospital population that would be in
 
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
the policy
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
this this was spoken about when somebody
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
was coding and there was a family member
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
who was thought that they might pass out
 
01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
there was something that was an invasive
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
thing there were cleaning wounds where
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
they knew that it was going to be
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
traumatic for a visitor to watch and and
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
those were the types of issues that were
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
brought to us about these
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
medically or therapeutically
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
contraindicated for the patient so i
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
think this is a lot narrower than has
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
been interpreted but i do think that
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
this is something that we can figure out
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
how it's handled in the hospitals but
 
01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
this is not a blanket documentation
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
requirement this is something for those
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
individualized cases where
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
where this is necessary for the patient
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
and then i guess i did have some other
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
questions but i can wait till we get to
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
those sections this section
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
that's how i rate it as well um
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
if somebody's threatening or violent
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
no emr is not where it goes but it goes
 
01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:12.390 align:start position:0%
no emr is not where it goes but it goes
somewhere

01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
and um i'm
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
of the mind that
 
01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:17.830 align:start position:0%
of the mind that
you've

01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
you've
 
01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:19.030 align:start position:0%
you've
heard

01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
what numbers of people are looking for
 
01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.669 align:start position:0%
what numbers of people are looking for
and

01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
my own preference is i could live
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
without this specific statement
 
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
some committee that i chair and tell me
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
what you've done
 
01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:35.350 align:start position:0%
what you've done
and

01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
i think it'll be good what you say but
 
01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
i think people need to know what's there
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
understood and i guess i would just you
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
know sort of echo the comment that paula
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
made was
 
01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not certain that this is something
 
01:51:49.119 --> 01:51:49.910 align:start position:0%
i'm not certain that this is something
that

01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
needs to be in statute um you know there
 
01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:54.639 align:start position:0%
are things that we can you know work
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
through um and i think again we're
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
looking as you said representatively on
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
sort of a narrow set of uh issues um but
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
again i don't know that that's um
 
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
a requirement for for for legislation or
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
for for something in statute um but
 
01:52:10.229 --> 01:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
we're certainly willing to come back and
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
and talk about that
 
01:52:14.070 --> 01:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
could you live with that
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
and the last one is
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
the avail the ready availability
 
01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:46.310 align:start position:0%
the avail the ready availability
of

01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
the bill of rights
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
not wallpaper
 
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
but not oh you got to go look for it
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
online somewhere but somewhere in the
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
middle what could you live with
 
01:53:00.070 --> 01:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
what i would what i would suggest is um
 
01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
let us come back um
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
again i don't know that we need to
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
legislate this issue um but let us work
 
01:53:09.669 --> 01:53:09.679 align:start position:0%
with the hospitals to try and figure out
 
01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
what is the most
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
effective and efficient way of of
 
01:53:15.189 --> 01:53:15.199 align:start position:0%
informing our patients of what those
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
policies are and how they can find more
 
01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:20.629 align:start position:0%
policies are and how they can find more
information

01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
senator sherman talked about
 
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
you know documentation that people get
 
01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
when they come into the hospital when
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
they're admitted um i don't have 26
 
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
versions of those in front of me so i
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
can't tell you exactly what each one of
 
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
them would have but i think that's
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
something that we can certainly um you
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
know work with our members to help make
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
sure patients are informed of of what
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
those uh you know what those policies
 
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
are and how they can uh you know find
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
more information if if if not just
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
asking um you know the representative
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:56.149 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman it sounds that
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
this would be um an issue of hospital
 
01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:02.229 align:start position:0%
this would be um an issue of hospital
policies

01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
policies
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to say that every
 
01:54:05.119 --> 01:54:06.310 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to say that every
that

01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
a written copy of the current visitation
 
01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
policies will be made available upon
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
request consistent with hospital policy
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
i actually just reviewed the
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
conditions of participation for critical
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
access hospitals which are a little
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
different than pps hospitals but this
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
section is is similar
 
01:54:27.669 --> 01:54:27.679 align:start position:0%
and that is a requirement already that
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
is why we don't believe that some of
 
01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
this needs to be in statute and state
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
statute because they're already
 
01:54:36.149 --> 01:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
complying with this um and um there are
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
hospital policies that's why the
 
01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals have risk management
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
committees and um and departments to
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are um pa protecting
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
patients and this is all again all about
 
01:54:46.639 --> 01:54:47.669 align:start position:0%
patients and this is all again all about
patients

01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
look into that as well but i i believe
 
01:54:56.070 --> 01:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
that they already make it available when
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
i know i've seen them when you register
 
01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
um they put the patient bill of rights
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
up there um but i think it could also be
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
in the packet so i don't believe we need
 
01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
to legislate this
 
01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
is the one who edits the quarterly
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
newsletter for our medical facility
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
it occurred to me some years ago that
 
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's not enough that when my medical
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
our patients need to know what we know
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
and to say we have a policy
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
to each other
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
isn't enough when the patients need to
 
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
know we have a policy on this available
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
upon request
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
and so i use our newsletter as a vehicle
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
each quarter
 
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
to inform the patients of specific
 
01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:43.350 align:start position:0%
to inform the patients of specific
things

01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
we've never been challenged they trust
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
us they love us we do great care they
 
01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
know we know but they now know what we
 
01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:51.109 align:start position:0%
know we know but they now know what we
know

01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
and that's the one link that's missing
 
01:55:58.070 --> 01:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's behind this bill is this fear and
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
this panic and there's this and this
 
01:55:59.599 --> 01:56:00.390 align:start position:0%
this panic and there's this and this
that

01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
and sometimes
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
more communication than necessary may be
 
01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:05.990 align:start position:0%
more communication than necessary may be
necessary

01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:56:08.310 --> 01:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
and that's what's behind this
 
01:56:11.189 --> 01:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
and i personally would be willing to say
 
01:56:11.199 --> 01:56:12.070 align:start position:0%
and i personally would be willing to say
well

01:56:12.070 --> 01:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
there was this uh political figure a
 
01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
number of years ago who was asked if he
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
trusted the commune the communists in
 
01:56:19.599 --> 01:56:21.030 align:start position:0%
trusted the commune the communists in
ussr

01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
ussr
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
and he said yes trust but verify
 
01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
so to get back
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
on this to say here is what we're doing
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
or we could do
 
01:56:32.159 --> 01:56:33.189 align:start position:0%
or we could do
to

01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:33.199 --> 01:56:34.550 align:start position:0%
to
honor

01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
honor
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
the concerns the fears the paranoias the
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
would go a long way
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to say yeah we get what
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
you're coming from and this is what
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
and maybe we can do a little bit more i
 
01:56:51.430 --> 01:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
could live with that as long as the
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
report comes back to me fairly quickly
 
01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
because this legislation file period in
 
01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
the fall
 
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
and if on these two items
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
there isn't adequate response which
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
i don't expect i think there will be
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
adequate response but if there isn't
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
then we can file a bill and we'll know
 
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
why we can file it so i mean that would
 
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
be my deal
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
i'd still like to have the written stuff
 
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
have it clear that the patient is able
 
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
to get the written policy and the
 
01:57:25.510 --> 01:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
patient advocate information upon
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
request in some way consistent with
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
hospital policies without dictating the
 
01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:30.629 align:start position:0%
hospital policies without dictating the
requirements

01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:30.639 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
and i would just suggest representative
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
leon that that is redundant
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
because i think it's already provided
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i would just need a couple a few
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
minutes to just find it but i i believe
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
that it is already that is already um
 
01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
provided upon request so it's somewhat
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
redundant um i don't know that the bill
 
01:57:54.070 --> 01:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be amended to incorporate that
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
but my one question is if the patients
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
can i i can't speak neither can you for
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
every patient but um it is like i said
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
we it is posted um when they are going
 
01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
through the admission process and it
 
01:58:15.189 --> 01:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
probably is in the in the packets that
 
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
they also receive when they're um
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
admitted but i i have to confirm that
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
and i would just suggest you know
 
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
putting it in state statute doesn't
 
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that that patient would
 
01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
be more informed um so again as i
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
suggested you know let us work with our
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
members to you know ensure that that
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
information is being provided and if we
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
come back and and we tell you that
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's not happening then you'll have a
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to move forward on
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
something else um but again i i i
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
believe that you know our members want
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
to do everything they can to ensure
 
01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
their patients you know get the right
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
care at the right time at the right
 
01:58:54.390 --> 01:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
place and the right way and that they're
 
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
supported throughout that process that's
 
01:58:58.470 --> 01:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's what we are committed to doing
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
that's what our members are committed to
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
doing um and again you know we're happy
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
to come back and share that information
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
whichever version of this is accepted
 
01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:11.510 align:start position:0%
whichever version of this is accepted
today

01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
will include
 
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
the words each healthcare facility
 
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
license pursuant to rsa 151 colon 2
 
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
shall post on its website and it lists a
 
01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
bunch of things you're going to have
 
01:59:22.159 --> 01:59:23.589 align:start position:0%
bunch of things you're going to have
that

01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
whichever version we agree to
 
01:59:28.629 --> 01:59:28.639 align:start position:0%
would just suggest some of us are just
 
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
suggesting it might be teased out a
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more specifically for the
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
patient and you're going to come back
 
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
and say
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
this is what you have been doing you
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
might even want to say and pursue into
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
this conversation
 
01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
plus we're going to do this as well
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
and that would be very helpful and
 
01:59:52.709 --> 01:59:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
and they have a reality of their own and
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
we all want to
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
defang them as much as we can
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
we all want we all want to find ways to
 
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
work of course we do and remember i deal
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
well i think we're there
 
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
are we there
 
02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:10.790 align:start position:0%
are we there
um

02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:17.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:18.629 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

02:00:18.629 --> 02:00:18.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's in the patient's bill of rights
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
we agree with that
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh we are going to
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
punt on the reason for denial but
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to get back to us on that
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
and we are going to
 
02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:38.390 align:start position:0%
and we are going to
punt

02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
punt
 
02:00:41.189 --> 02:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
on exactly other than the website the
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
information is available and they're
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
going to get back to us on that
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
so in those last two cases we would
 
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
agree with the
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
senate's version
 
02:00:53.189 --> 02:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
are we there i'm assuming that
 
02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
the information is in fact provided i'm
 
02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
i'm great with that if we find out that
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
there's a lack i definitely appreciate
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
support in passing this next year if we
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
need to do something and if that's the
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
case then i can agree with this today
 
02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
so i think we're
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
i'll go down to ols and
 
02:01:19.510 --> 02:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
it succeed to senate on points three and
 
02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:23.189 align:start position:0%
it succeed to senate on points three and
four

02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
actually i think it is exceed the senate
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
on two
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
um i think it would simply be inserting
 
02:01:31.589 --> 02:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
the words patient support act um and i
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
can figure out exactly the lines that's
 
02:01:38.070 --> 02:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:41.109 --> 02:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
um that's what i have senator okay okay
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:52.070 --> 04:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:55.590 --> 04:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
to call in to session the committee of
 
04:03:55.600 --> 04:03:57.189 align:start position:0%
to call in to session the committee of
conference

04:03:57.189 --> 04:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
conference
 
04:03:59.389 --> 04:03:59.399 align:start position:0%
meeting on house bill
 
04:03:59.399 --> 04:04:01.269 align:start position:0%
meeting on house bill
1662

04:04:01.269 --> 04:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
1662
 
04:04:01.279 --> 04:04:02.710 align:start position:0%
1662
and

04:04:02.710 --> 04:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:04:03.390 --> 04:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
would you
 
04:04:03.400 --> 04:04:05.590 align:start position:0%
would you
[Music]

04:04:05.590 --> 04:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:04:09.510 --> 04:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
this is the mother of side by sides
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
and it explains the fact that we have
 
04:04:13.590 --> 04:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
four parts
 
04:04:15.269 --> 04:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
04:04:15.279 --> 04:04:16.710 align:start position:0%
to this bill
now

04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:04:16.720 --> 04:04:17.670 align:start position:0%
now
and

04:04:17.670 --> 04:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:04:20.790 --> 04:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
i would like to go through each section
 
04:04:23.990 --> 04:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
bit by bit to see
 
04:04:28.150 --> 04:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:29.990 --> 04:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
the first part establishes a data
 
04:04:32.229 --> 04:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
privacy an information technology
 
04:04:35.830 --> 04:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
security governance board within dhhs to
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
oversee data privacy risk calculation
 
04:04:41.189 --> 04:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
and risk mitigation efforts and provides
 
04:04:43.349 --> 04:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
for two employees with the department to
 
04:04:45.670 --> 04:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
accomplish these objectives
 
04:04:48.469 --> 04:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
one of my joys is chairman of the joint
 
04:04:50.950 --> 04:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
legislative dhhs
 
04:04:53.269 --> 04:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
oversight committee is watching the
 
04:04:55.110 --> 04:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
development of this program under
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
04:05:00.070 --> 04:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
we had at least three of our monthly
 
04:05:03.189 --> 04:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
meetings in part devoted to this because
 
04:05:05.110 --> 04:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
we want to do two things at once if
 
04:05:08.550 --> 04:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
possible number one provide usable
 
04:05:12.150 --> 04:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
helpful data and number two make sure
 
04:05:15.110 --> 04:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
the security is the best it can be and
 
04:05:16.790 --> 04:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
with those two
 
04:05:19.590 --> 04:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
necessities how can it happen so i'm
 
04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
going to ask representative edwards to
 
04:05:23.429 --> 04:05:23.439 align:start position:0%
say a few words about uh
 
04:05:25.110 --> 04:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
what he pulled off
 
04:05:27.990 --> 04:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh thank you mr chair i this is
 
04:05:30.150 --> 04:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
really a great team effort with the
 
04:05:31.990 --> 04:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
department and with the department of
 
04:05:32.000 --> 04:05:33.110 align:start position:0%
department and with the department of
i.t

04:05:33.110 --> 04:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
i.t
 
04:05:33.120 --> 04:05:33.910 align:start position:0%
i.t
uh

04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:05:33.920 --> 04:05:34.950 align:start position:0%
uh
both

04:05:34.950 --> 04:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
both
 
04:05:37.189 --> 04:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
departments have shown strong support
 
04:05:39.990 --> 04:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
for the idea of establishing a privacy
 
04:05:42.830 --> 04:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
functional capability within
 
04:05:45.349 --> 04:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
their departments
 
04:05:45.359 --> 04:05:46.389 align:start position:0%
their departments
um

04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:48.630 --> 04:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
i i think uh
 
04:05:52.309 --> 04:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot to 1662 that they
 
04:05:54.710 --> 04:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
could choose to do on their own without
 
04:05:56.309 --> 04:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
04:06:00.150 --> 04:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
but if we were to not pass 1662
 
04:06:03.349 --> 04:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
the issue with that would be that um the
 
04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
funding to to create two new positions
 
04:06:09.510 --> 04:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
with entirely new skill sets would not
 
04:06:12.309 --> 04:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
happen and what is the new skill set you
 
04:06:14.550 --> 04:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
really need to have somebody who
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
understands cyber security understands
 
04:06:21.110 --> 04:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh privacy principles and understands
 
04:06:24.389 --> 04:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
business process flows so that they can
 
04:06:26.710 --> 04:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
identify weaknesses and and come up with
 
04:06:29.110 --> 04:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
mitigation strategies for them and the
 
04:06:30.550 --> 04:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
department when they've tried to do
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
these privacy impact assessments have
 
04:06:35.189 --> 04:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
had to rely on contractors so they they
 
04:06:37.590 --> 04:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
have even the capability today to do the
 
04:06:39.910 --> 04:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
entire bill but
 
04:06:41.349 --> 04:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
but the
 
04:06:44.070 --> 04:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
creating the in-house staff
 
04:06:44.080 --> 04:06:44.950 align:start position:0%
creating the in-house staff
would

04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:06:47.830 --> 04:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
start to develop institutional
 
04:06:50.070 --> 04:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge and memory and and would just
 
04:06:53.110 --> 04:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
move the department along faster so i i
 
04:06:54.950 --> 04:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
think it's a good bill i hope we can
 
04:06:57.750 --> 04:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
support it if if we can it's not the end
 
04:06:59.189 --> 04:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
of the world
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
unless i missed something in the big
 
04:07:03.670 --> 04:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
side by side there is no difference
 
04:07:05.910 --> 04:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
between the senate and the house
 
04:07:08.150 --> 04:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like the senate's position
 
04:07:09.990 --> 04:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
the house was positioned on this is
 
04:07:10.000 --> 04:07:11.189 align:start position:0%
the house was positioned on this is
already

04:07:11.189 --> 04:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:07:14.950 --> 04:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
known so if there is no objection do we
 
04:07:16.630 --> 04:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
sign off on
 
04:07:21.110 --> 04:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
part one of what we have before us
 
04:07:22.469 --> 04:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
i don't see
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
any any questions while
 
04:07:29.830 --> 04:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:31.590 --> 04:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
the second section of this is found on
 
04:07:36.630 --> 04:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
the very bottom of page five it is
 
04:07:39.030 --> 04:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
housing expenses for homeless people and
 
04:07:41.590 --> 04:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation five million dollars and
 
04:07:44.229 --> 04:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
you will see that this is carved up
 
04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
amongst the various towns in the next
 
04:07:50.630 --> 04:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:52.149 --> 04:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
and that's senator khan i believe that
 
04:07:54.309 --> 04:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
is your project if you can speak to that
 
04:07:57.030 --> 04:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:08:01.429 --> 04:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:08:01.439 --> 04:08:03.030 align:start position:0%
um so
the

04:08:03.030 --> 04:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:08:05.269 --> 04:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
first debate that occurred on
 
04:08:07.830 --> 04:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
homelessness funding for the biennium
 
04:08:11.429 --> 04:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
took place around house bill 2.
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
04:08:13.680 --> 04:08:14.950 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
services

04:08:14.950 --> 04:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:08:16.630 --> 04:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
housing security
 
04:08:20.309 --> 04:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
proposed a dollar amount
 
04:08:20.319 --> 04:08:21.750 align:start position:0%
proposed a dollar amount
and

04:08:21.750 --> 04:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:08:24.950 --> 04:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
that was essentially halved
 
04:08:24.960 --> 04:08:26.229 align:start position:0%
that was essentially halved
during

04:08:26.229 --> 04:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
during
 
04:08:28.870 --> 04:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
the appropriation process so the amount
 
04:08:31.510 --> 04:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
of funding is significantly less in the
 
04:08:33.269 --> 04:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
biennium than what was originally
 
04:08:36.070 --> 04:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
requested and that was the motivation of
 
04:08:40.469 --> 04:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:40.479 --> 04:08:41.349 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:08:41.349 --> 04:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
so it's it's essentially the same it
 
04:08:46.149 --> 04:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
started as the same bill as what was
 
04:08:48.550 --> 04:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
requested by hhs for housing support for
 
04:08:51.110 --> 04:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
the biennium
 
04:08:54.389 --> 04:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
we've passed fiscal 22 so let's focus on
 
04:08:57.030 --> 04:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23.
 
04:09:02.469 --> 04:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:02.479 --> 04:09:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:09:04.070 --> 04:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:06.550 --> 04:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
the availability and affordability of
 
04:09:06.560 --> 04:09:07.590 align:start position:0%
the availability and affordability of
housing

04:09:07.590 --> 04:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:09:09.910 --> 04:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
those problems continue to persist
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're not going to go away anytime
 
04:09:11.760 --> 04:09:12.710 align:start position:0%
they're not going to go away anytime
soon

04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
soon
 
04:09:15.429 --> 04:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
it is a central part of the governor's
 
04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
task force on uh the council on housing
 
04:09:18.880 --> 04:09:20.309 align:start position:0%
task force on uh the council on housing
stability

04:09:20.309 --> 04:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
stability
 
04:09:20.319 --> 04:09:22.070 align:start position:0%
stability
to

04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:09:24.229 --> 04:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
try to provide greater assistance to
 
04:09:28.950 --> 04:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
towns and shelters for homelessness
 
04:09:30.790 --> 04:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
and to help people
 
04:09:34.149 --> 04:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
avoid of getting into
 
04:09:36.149 --> 04:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
that kind of situation
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
so originally the senate
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
on the bill that i proposed tabled the
 
04:09:42.479 --> 04:09:43.590 align:start position:0%
on the bill that i proposed tabled the
bill

04:09:43.590 --> 04:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:09:43.600 --> 04:09:44.630 align:start position:0%
bill
uh

04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:09:44.640 --> 04:09:45.910 align:start position:0%
uh
and

04:09:45.910 --> 04:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:45.920 --> 04:09:46.950 align:start position:0%
and
uh

04:09:46.950 --> 04:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:09:50.070 --> 04:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
the reason was that the route for
 
04:09:54.149 --> 04:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
distributing the dollars was suggested
 
04:09:57.189 --> 04:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
in same way as it was for a house bill 2
 
04:09:58.870 --> 04:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
an allocation that would go to the
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
department and the department would
 
04:10:04.710 --> 04:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
distribute it to the contracted shelters
 
04:10:07.349 --> 04:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
the 40 contracted shelters that the
 
04:10:11.590 --> 04:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
department has existing agreements with
 
04:10:14.149 --> 04:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
the disagreement in the senate
 
04:10:17.670 --> 04:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
conversation was that's not providing a
 
04:10:19.990 --> 04:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
wide enough distribution across the
 
04:10:23.110 --> 04:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
state that in fact there are towns that
 
04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
are experiencing costs related to
 
04:10:28.229 --> 04:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
homelessness or housing and security
 
04:10:31.830 --> 04:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
that are being born in every town
 
04:10:33.750 --> 04:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:10:36.389 --> 04:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
we needed to find a mechanism for that
 
04:10:39.590 --> 04:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
distribution i'd been working with
 
04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative umberger
 
04:10:43.990 --> 04:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
on trying to find a substitute for free
 
04:10:45.670 --> 04:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch
 
04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
and that substitute that we've talked
 
04:10:50.790 --> 04:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
about is medicaid
 
04:10:52.710 --> 04:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
eligibility and
 
04:10:52.720 --> 04:10:53.990 align:start position:0%
eligibility and
enrollments

04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
enrollments
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
so the department of health and human
 
04:10:57.910 --> 04:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
services uh has
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
a mechanism for reporting that by town
 
04:11:03.910 --> 04:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
to the legislative budget assistant and
 
04:11:06.830 --> 04:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
that's where the april 3rd
 
04:11:10.710 --> 04:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
237 lives covered by medicaid is the
 
04:11:10.720 --> 04:11:11.670 align:start position:0%
237 lives covered by medicaid is the
source

04:11:11.670 --> 04:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
source
 
04:11:15.910 --> 04:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
for identifying which towns how much
 
04:11:18.630 --> 04:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
eligibility they might have
 
04:11:20.790 --> 04:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
we arrived at a 5 million we were
 
04:11:24.070 --> 04:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
working with a 5 million dollar request
 
04:11:26.389 --> 04:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
and then distributed that 5 million
 
04:11:29.830 --> 04:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
dollars based on medicaid enrollments
 
04:11:31.910 --> 04:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
by town
 
04:11:33.510 --> 04:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
as of april 3rd
 
04:11:36.070 --> 04:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
those enrollments uh
 
04:11:37.750 --> 04:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's not a
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
town that doesn't have a couple dozen
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
people who are medicaid eligible and
 
04:11:42.880 --> 04:11:44.790 align:start position:0%
people who are medicaid eligible and
enrolled

04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
enrolled
 
04:11:44.800 --> 04:11:45.670 align:start position:0%
enrolled
so

04:11:45.670 --> 04:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
it does distribute dollars to every
 
04:11:50.229 --> 04:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
all 234
 
04:11:54.309 --> 04:11:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:57.189 --> 04:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
and it does so in a manner that the
 
04:12:00.070 --> 04:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
towns have local control
 
04:12:02.710 --> 04:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
this is not just prescribed to the 40
 
04:12:05.670 --> 04:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
towns that at 40 shelters
 
04:12:08.229 --> 04:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
under which have contracts
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
this is allocated two towns
 
04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
now towns
 
04:12:15.910 --> 04:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
i've started following uh representative
 
04:12:15.920 --> 04:12:18.630 align:start position:0%
i've started following uh representative
edwards

04:12:18.630 --> 04:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:21.110 --> 04:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
thought pattern
 
04:12:22.950 --> 04:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
towns are helped
 
04:12:22.960 --> 04:12:24.790 align:start position:0%
towns are helped
help

04:12:24.790 --> 04:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
help
 
04:12:26.710 --> 04:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
homeless and people in risk of
 
04:12:30.309 --> 04:12:30.319 align:start position:0%
homelessness in a variety of ways it's
 
04:12:33.189 --> 04:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
either through rent subsidies
 
04:12:36.550 --> 04:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh mortgage uh
 
04:12:36.560 --> 04:12:38.070 align:start position:0%
uh mortgage uh
subsidy

04:12:38.070 --> 04:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
subsidy
 
04:12:41.189 --> 04:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
because if a person is in risk of losing
 
04:12:42.790 --> 04:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
their home
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's a taxable property that's going
 
04:12:47.429 --> 04:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
to go into default and the town is going
 
04:12:49.590 --> 04:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
to lose that those dollars so i i've
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
been on a city council that's what we
 
04:12:53.590 --> 04:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
did uh
 
04:12:55.670 --> 04:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
that was that's another way those are
 
04:12:58.870 --> 04:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
the direct routes the indirect routes
 
04:13:01.269 --> 04:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
are the towns make payments to homeless
 
04:13:03.510 --> 04:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
shelters and to other community service
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
housing agencies that provide housing
 
04:13:08.790 --> 04:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
assistance that might include community
 
04:13:11.110 --> 04:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
action programs across the state or
 
04:13:12.950 --> 04:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
women's violence protection just to give
 
04:13:15.750 --> 04:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
you a couple and and i happen to check
 
04:13:17.349 --> 04:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
with your towns
 
04:13:18.309 --> 04:13:18.319 align:start position:0%
to see
 
04:13:22.070 --> 04:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh what they are doing uh as far as
 
04:13:25.670 --> 04:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
making payments from their town budgets
 
04:13:28.950 --> 04:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
to either direct subsidy or
 
04:13:31.110 --> 04:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
indirect subsidy through payments
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
through third parties
 
04:13:37.040 --> 04:13:37.050 align:start position:0%
and each of them is doing all the above
 
04:13:37.050 --> 04:13:39.590 align:start position:0%
and each of them is doing all the above
[Music]

04:13:39.590 --> 04:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:13:42.070 --> 04:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
so in summary i think we've got a
 
04:13:42.080 --> 04:13:43.510 align:start position:0%
so in summary i think we've got a
solution

04:13:43.510 --> 04:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
solution
 
04:13:45.269 --> 04:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
to an issue
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh that is going to persist into the
 
04:13:50.309 --> 04:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 year
 
04:13:50.319 --> 04:13:51.269 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 year
we

04:13:51.269 --> 04:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:13:53.110 --> 04:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
have estimates from the department that
 
04:13:55.429 --> 04:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
this is fifteen hundred people
 
04:13:57.189 --> 04:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
who are homeless
 
04:13:58.950 --> 04:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
04:14:00.950 --> 04:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
during this last season
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
we have estimates from the department of
 
04:14:04.309 --> 04:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
education that say that there are four
 
04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
thousand school-age children who
 
04:14:08.469 --> 04:14:08.479 align:start position:0%
experience homelessness in the course of
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
the school year
 
04:14:14.710 --> 04:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh and we only have 965 sheltered beds
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh so this problem is going to persist
 
04:14:20.950 --> 04:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
and if it's not in your town today uh
 
04:14:20.960 --> 04:14:22.630 align:start position:0%
and if it's not in your town today uh
amen

04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
amen
 
04:14:24.309 --> 04:14:24.319 align:start position:0%
but this is a
 
04:14:25.910 --> 04:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
a relief valve
 
04:14:25.920 --> 04:14:26.710 align:start position:0%
a relief valve
and

04:14:26.710 --> 04:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:29.510 --> 04:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
it enables your town to contribute to
 
04:14:32.070 --> 04:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
some bigger efforts in your counties
 
04:14:35.110 --> 04:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
which no doubt are being paid for
 
04:14:37.189 --> 04:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
with local monies
 
04:14:38.469 --> 04:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
so that's the
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's the position of the senate when
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
this came to a vote
 
04:14:44.550 --> 04:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh fairly recently as an amendment on
 
04:14:44.560 --> 04:14:46.229 align:start position:0%
uh fairly recently as an amendment on
1662

04:14:46.229 --> 04:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
1662
 
04:14:49.189 --> 04:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh it passed unanimously on a roll call
 
04:14:51.510 --> 04:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
vote 24 to nothing
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
so i we've achieved that bipartisan
 
04:14:57.750 --> 04:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
buy-in to this i hope we can do that in
 
04:14:59.349 --> 04:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
in this
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
committee of conference thank you
 
04:15:04.950 --> 04:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
any questions for the senator
 
04:15:06.790 --> 04:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
04:15:10.070 --> 04:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair uh senator khan
 
04:15:11.510 --> 04:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
you and i had a chance to talk about
 
04:15:13.750 --> 04:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
this the other night and since then i've
 
04:15:15.269 --> 04:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
been trying to
 
04:15:18.469 --> 04:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
continue to come up to speed on this is
 
04:15:21.990 --> 04:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
as i understand it the the state for
 
04:15:24.389 --> 04:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
more than the past budget cycle
 
04:15:27.990 --> 04:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
has had a fund where it could res
 
04:15:30.630 --> 04:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
we could have the governor's budget put
 
04:15:33.429 --> 04:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
money into an account
 
04:15:36.309 --> 04:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
that would be authorized to to
 
04:15:38.950 --> 04:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
be spent in the manner that your bill
 
04:15:38.960 --> 04:15:40.389 align:start position:0%
be spent in the manner that your bill
prescribes

04:15:40.389 --> 04:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
prescribes
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
and i just want to verify with you if
 
04:15:44.070 --> 04:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
you think that that's true that there
 
04:15:44.080 --> 04:15:44.830 align:start position:0%
you think that that's true that there
has

04:15:44.830 --> 04:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:15:48.309 --> 04:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
been for more than one budget cycle an
 
04:15:48.319 --> 04:15:49.349 align:start position:0%
been for more than one budget cycle an
account

04:15:49.349 --> 04:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
account
 
04:15:51.510 --> 04:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
that the governor could have funded
 
04:15:51.520 --> 04:15:52.389 align:start position:0%
that the governor could have funded
that

04:15:52.389 --> 04:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:15:56.070 --> 04:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
would have met this purpose
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
i'm going to i think there are people
 
04:16:01.269 --> 04:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
here could we can we ask that of uh
 
04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
somebody from hhs
 
04:16:05.110 --> 04:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
it's up to you more familiar
 
04:16:06.550 --> 04:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's up to the chair
 
04:16:09.830 --> 04:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
somebody from hhs
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
that would be you
 
04:16:13.990 --> 04:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
you are indeed somebody thank you thank
 
04:16:18.149 --> 04:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:19.590 --> 04:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
it is now
 
04:16:21.590 --> 04:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chris antonello
 
04:16:23.510 --> 04:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
04:16:26.309 --> 04:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner i think
 
04:16:28.229 --> 04:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
if i'm understanding your question
 
04:16:31.510 --> 04:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
correctly um representative edwards um
 
04:16:35.590 --> 04:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
the department has for the last two
 
04:16:35.600 --> 04:16:36.389 align:start position:0%
the department has for the last two
um

04:16:36.389 --> 04:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:39.429 --> 04:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
by budget request requested dollars for
 
04:16:39.439 --> 04:16:40.630 align:start position:0%
by budget request requested dollars for
shelters

04:16:40.630 --> 04:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
shelters
 
04:16:43.349 --> 04:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
um specifically for shelter services so
 
04:16:44.790 --> 04:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
that money would be added to our
 
04:16:47.670 --> 04:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
contract line to go to shelters this is
 
04:16:50.550 --> 04:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
a little different and that has not been
 
04:16:52.790 --> 04:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
funded for an increase in that this is a
 
04:16:54.070 --> 04:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
little different because it would go to
 
04:16:56.469 --> 04:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
the communities and
 
04:16:59.110 --> 04:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
i think one of the benefits of it going
 
04:17:00.229 --> 04:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:17:03.830 --> 04:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
towns and cities is it really
 
04:17:06.790 --> 04:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
could be used um to keep people housed
 
04:17:09.030 --> 04:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
right because that's ultimately what we
 
04:17:11.590 --> 04:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
want to do is have people remain
 
04:17:13.189 --> 04:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
um in their
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
um where they are how so they don't
 
04:17:17.429 --> 04:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
become homeless
 
04:17:19.670 --> 04:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
follow follow up okay so you just taught
 
04:17:21.750 --> 04:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
me something you've you taught me the
 
04:17:24.550 --> 04:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
distinction between what we've had for a
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
few years which is money
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
in a homeless shelter program and that
 
04:17:32.149 --> 04:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
this is distinct in that this is money
 
04:17:34.469 --> 04:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
that can go straight to the towns and
 
04:17:36.630 --> 04:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
we've not done that in the past correct
 
04:17:39.990 --> 04:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
and towns depending on the community um
 
04:17:42.389 --> 04:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
could choose to give that money to a
 
04:17:45.429 --> 04:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
local shelter they could use it to help
 
04:17:48.550 --> 04:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
keep people you know in their um place
 
04:17:51.429 --> 04:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
of residence so our money today
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
we have at the department goes out in
 
04:17:56.710 --> 04:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
contracts to support the shelters once
 
04:18:00.229 --> 04:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
people need a shelter oh okay so um so
 
04:18:02.710 --> 04:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
this takes me in two directions one if
 
04:18:02.720 --> 04:18:03.429 align:start position:0%
this takes me in two directions one if
it's

04:18:03.429 --> 04:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:18:06.870 --> 04:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
if it's general funds does it lapse on
 
04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
january on june 30th of 2023
 
04:18:11.830 --> 04:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
04:18:15.349 --> 04:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
if if the governor uses general funds
 
04:18:17.990 --> 04:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
does are we creating a use it or lose it
 
04:18:20.229 --> 04:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
kind of situation for the towns that
 
04:18:22.870 --> 04:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's one part
 
04:18:22.880 --> 04:18:24.389 align:start position:0%
that's that's one part
so

04:18:24.389 --> 04:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:26.790 --> 04:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to look at
 
04:18:29.990 --> 04:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
john who left um i believe
 
04:18:32.070 --> 04:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
don't leave me here john you got me i
 
04:18:34.870 --> 04:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
believe that general funds do lapse
 
04:18:37.349 --> 04:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
unless they it is
 
04:18:42.710 --> 04:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:44.229 --> 04:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing in the legislation
 
04:18:47.349 --> 04:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
that prevents that thanks john
 
04:18:50.790 --> 04:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
good job mr williams oh okay so so just
 
04:18:52.710 --> 04:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
so you know i have a little concern
 
04:18:55.429 --> 04:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
there about uh this is a new program for
 
04:18:58.630 --> 04:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
the towns it's use it or losing money
 
04:19:00.469 --> 04:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
you know it's probably it's just sort of
 
04:19:01.910 --> 04:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
setting them up to fail because they
 
04:19:03.990 --> 04:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
don't really know how to spend this kind
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
of money when the state has given it to
 
04:19:09.349 --> 04:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
them so we would distribute it um by
 
04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
there's a date here i want to say august
 
04:19:14.229 --> 04:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
1st we would um put
 
04:19:16.229 --> 04:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
when we distribute it what it would be
 
04:19:19.030 --> 04:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
used for i do think
 
04:19:19.040 --> 04:19:19.990 align:start position:0%
used for i do think
um

04:19:19.990 --> 04:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
we could look to add something about
 
04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
reporting so we would know how people
 
04:19:26.630 --> 04:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
are spending it and also i think what's
 
04:19:30.309 --> 04:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
key in this bill is really um we already
 
04:19:33.990 --> 04:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
are partnering um with the um local
 
04:19:35.750 --> 04:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
welfare administrators and that's been
 
04:19:37.750 --> 04:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
really successful and we would actually
 
04:19:39.429 --> 04:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
put that in any
 
04:19:40.950 --> 04:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
letter that we put out because some of
 
04:19:43.030 --> 04:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
the smaller towns probably don't even
 
04:19:44.710 --> 04:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
know the work that we're doing that's in
 
04:19:47.429 --> 04:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
the larger communities um and we would
 
04:19:49.750 --> 04:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
really um continue to do that to help
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
those communities so one final so so
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
give us some context here this this 5
 
04:19:55.680 --> 04:19:56.630 align:start position:0%
give us some context here this this 5
million

04:19:56.630 --> 04:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:20:00.710 --> 04:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
relative to what um division three gave
 
04:20:00.720 --> 04:20:01.510 align:start position:0%
relative to what um division three gave
for

04:20:01.510 --> 04:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:20:04.229 --> 04:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
homelessness yeah in the in the current
 
04:20:04.239 --> 04:20:05.590 align:start position:0%
homelessness yeah in the in the current
biennium

04:20:05.590 --> 04:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
04:20:06.870 --> 04:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
you're killing me
 
04:20:09.349 --> 04:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
i i'm putting you on the spot
 
04:20:11.750 --> 04:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to know this 5 million is
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
effectively the same amount that we just
 
04:20:16.309 --> 04:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
matched it or if this is a tiny fraction
 
04:20:18.149 --> 04:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
of what we put into the homeless money
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's a significant portion to assisting
 
04:20:22.560 --> 04:20:24.389 align:start position:0%
it's a significant portion to assisting
people

04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:20:26.790 --> 04:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
who may be experiencing homelessness i
 
04:20:30.070 --> 04:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
do not have our final budget because um
 
04:20:32.469 --> 04:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
it's a combination of general funds and
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of um federal funds that
 
04:20:36.630 --> 04:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
we put in our budget i don't know if
 
04:20:39.110 --> 04:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
senator khan knows oh good he knows oh
 
04:20:41.110 --> 04:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
you you know the answer to that
 
04:20:42.630 --> 04:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
oh perfect
 
04:20:45.189 --> 04:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
it it the budgeted amount
 
04:20:47.429 --> 04:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
per fiscal year is around three million
 
04:20:47.439 --> 04:20:49.830 align:start position:0%
per fiscal year is around three million
dollars

04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:20:51.750 --> 04:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
just for the shelter services though we
 
04:20:54.950 --> 04:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
have other programs
 
04:21:01.349 --> 04:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:03.990 --> 04:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
other questions regarding this part of
 
04:21:07.030 --> 04:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
04:21:10.550 --> 04:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
if i might senator um
 
04:21:10.560 --> 04:21:11.590 align:start position:0%
if i might senator um
i've

04:21:11.590 --> 04:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
i've
 
04:21:14.469 --> 04:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
had several follow-up conversations with
 
04:21:18.309 --> 04:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh the department uh they have made a
 
04:21:19.830 --> 04:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
few suggestions
 
04:21:23.189 --> 04:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
i'm glad to hand those out to you
 
04:21:24.870 --> 04:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
04:21:24.880 --> 04:21:26.550 align:start position:0%
at this point
and

04:21:26.550 --> 04:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:30.790 --> 04:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
i read these suggestions as expanding
 
04:21:30.800 --> 04:21:31.990 align:start position:0%
i read these suggestions as expanding
the

04:21:31.990 --> 04:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:21:34.630 --> 04:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
uses of the funds by the local
 
04:21:37.110 --> 04:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
government entities
 
04:21:39.189 --> 04:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
so it's not a con not putting any
 
04:21:41.110 --> 04:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
further constraints on it but it's
 
04:21:43.189 --> 04:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
opening it up as
 
04:21:46.149 --> 04:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
chris sanello is just describing to make
 
04:21:48.950 --> 04:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
sure that those people who are at risk
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
of homelessness
 
04:21:53.189 --> 04:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
that the towns are able to address that
 
04:21:55.590 --> 04:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
need very clearly in addition to the
 
04:21:57.269 --> 04:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
homelessness situation
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:06.630 --> 04:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:09.269 --> 04:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
concern i think i share with a number
 
04:22:11.750 --> 04:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:22:13.910 --> 04:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
i really don't like bills being attached
 
04:22:15.910 --> 04:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
to other bills being attached to other
 
04:22:17.670 --> 04:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
bills and especially if there's a lot of
 
04:22:20.229 --> 04:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
money involved that we do have a budget
 
04:22:22.950 --> 04:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
process we had one a year ago and we've
 
04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
got one starting
 
04:22:26.469 --> 04:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
pretty soon
 
04:22:29.590 --> 04:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
and this looks like a wonderful
 
04:22:31.670 --> 04:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
item for that budget but here we are in
 
04:22:34.149 --> 04:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
the middle and now we've got the request
 
04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
for a very large expenditure of money
 
04:22:39.990 --> 04:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
and i know that because numbers of these
 
04:22:42.550 --> 04:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
bills with requests for a large amount
 
04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
of money are coming
 
04:22:46.630 --> 04:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure what this is going to
 
04:22:49.510 --> 04:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
do with either the money we want to keep
 
04:22:51.429 --> 04:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
aside or the money perhaps we want to
 
04:22:54.229 --> 04:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
give back to the taxpayers uh that is a
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
concern the issue is separate in my mind
 
04:23:00.630 --> 04:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
from the general concern but this issue
 
04:23:03.110 --> 04:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
falls into it in that manner it's a
 
04:23:06.070 --> 04:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
procedural kind of problem that i have
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
if i might address that mr chairman
 
04:23:11.830 --> 04:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
yeah please sir um and i i understand
 
04:23:14.550 --> 04:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
your broader concern
 
04:23:16.870 --> 04:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
the original request by the department
 
04:23:19.189 --> 04:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
was for eight million dollars eight to
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars closer to nine
 
04:23:23.670 --> 04:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars in each of the two
 
04:23:26.149 --> 04:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
years of the biennium so
 
04:23:26.159 --> 04:23:26.950 align:start position:0%
years of the biennium so
i

04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:23:30.870 --> 04:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
think what this is doing is for fiscal
 
04:23:30.880 --> 04:23:32.389 align:start position:0%
think what this is doing is for fiscal
23

04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
23
 
04:23:34.950 --> 04:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
essentially coming up to that original
 
04:23:37.189 --> 04:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
request which we were unable to fund
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
originally in the hb2 but we do face
 
04:23:43.110 --> 04:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
this wonderful
 
04:23:46.550 --> 04:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
situation uh at the end of fiscal 22
 
04:23:49.429 --> 04:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
looking into fiscal 23 where we've got
 
04:23:52.229 --> 04:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
some resources and i think the
 
04:23:53.750 --> 04:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
conversation that we've had in the
 
04:23:56.790 --> 04:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
senate uh is
 
04:23:59.349 --> 04:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
this is this is a great opportunity
 
04:24:02.950 --> 04:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
to see a rising tide lift all boats
 
04:24:02.960 --> 04:24:03.910 align:start position:0%
to see a rising tide lift all boats
uh

04:24:03.910 --> 04:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:06.309 --> 04:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
not everybody's fortunate enough to be
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
lifted by some of the ideas that we've
 
04:24:09.670 --> 04:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
04:24:11.670 --> 04:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
that hopefully will
 
04:24:14.309 --> 04:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
be enacted upon tax relief and things
 
04:24:15.349 --> 04:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
like that
 
04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:22.630 --> 04:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
that that we otherwise would not be and
 
04:24:25.670 --> 04:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
i think it does fall into that
 
04:24:30.309 --> 04:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
that that category of what were we
 
04:24:32.309 --> 04:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
18 months ago or
 
04:24:34.149 --> 04:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
whenever we started that budget process
 
04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
what were we unable to do
 
04:24:40.149 --> 04:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
that then that today we are and that we
 
04:24:42.790 --> 04:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
can in fiscal 23
 
04:24:45.750 --> 04:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
and achieve some of the goals that
 
04:24:48.710 --> 04:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
departments and the state have
 
04:24:50.870 --> 04:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
am i correct and assuming and i think i
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
heard it but i want to nail the point
 
04:24:54.309 --> 04:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
down it is much
 
04:24:57.110 --> 04:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
easier and i think cost effective
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
to help a person who's in danger of
 
04:25:01.189 --> 04:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
becoming homeless
 
04:25:03.110 --> 04:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
than it is to
 
04:25:05.429 --> 04:25:05.439 align:start position:0%
gather up the homeless and get them back
 
04:25:07.750 --> 04:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
into something
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's partly dependent on the
 
04:25:12.389 --> 04:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
services that are provided around that
 
04:25:12.399 --> 04:25:13.670 align:start position:0%
services that are provided around that
person

04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:25:15.510 --> 04:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
a person who's in their home doesn't
 
04:25:16.870 --> 04:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
have to face
 
04:25:20.309 --> 04:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
that that terrible situation of i don't
 
04:25:22.469 --> 04:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
know where i'm sleeping
 
04:25:25.830 --> 04:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
but for those who are in the shelters
 
04:25:27.990 --> 04:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
the kind of supports that they provide
 
04:25:30.790 --> 04:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
can provide if they're adequately funded
 
04:25:33.429 --> 04:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
like job training like
 
04:25:35.110 --> 04:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
job location
 
04:25:36.630 --> 04:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
those are terrific services that
 
04:25:36.640 --> 04:25:38.149 align:start position:0%
those are terrific services that
hopefully

04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
04:25:40.469 --> 04:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
lift people out i remember andy
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
sanborn's line we're giving people a
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
senator carson thank you mr chairman may
 
04:25:51.750 --> 04:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
i ask the question of senator please do
 
04:25:55.429 --> 04:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you senator um in reading this
 
04:25:56.309 --> 04:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
04:25:59.590 --> 04:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
in reading this amendment senator i i
 
04:26:03.830 --> 04:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
see where the point um is or at risk of
 
04:26:06.070 --> 04:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
homelessness and i think this speaks to
 
04:26:07.590 --> 04:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
the question
 
04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
that has been posed about
 
04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
helping people before they get homeless
 
04:26:15.990 --> 04:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
so the allocations of this fund could be
 
04:26:19.349 --> 04:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
used to address that situation to get to
 
04:26:21.990 --> 04:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
people before their they find themselves
 
04:26:24.070 --> 04:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
without a place to live am i correct i
 
04:26:25.750 --> 04:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
agree with you thank you
 
04:26:27.750 --> 04:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
senator birdsall
 
04:26:31.590 --> 04:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um with that question
 
04:26:34.149 --> 04:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
dovetailing on senator carson
 
04:26:36.070 --> 04:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
um i don't have you heard of the
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
organization called family promises
 
04:26:42.070 --> 04:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
04:26:43.750 --> 04:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
you might be able to answer would that
 
04:26:47.670 --> 04:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
be an organization that would benefit um
 
04:26:51.110 --> 04:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
from this potentially so the control
 
04:26:53.110 --> 04:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
of these funds are with the cities and
 
04:26:55.349 --> 04:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
towns so it would be up to the cities
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
and towns um and so they would have that
 
04:27:01.349 --> 04:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
option but uh um so
 
04:27:03.189 --> 04:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
it could
 
04:27:06.070 --> 04:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
so does that help follow follow up
 
04:27:09.429 --> 04:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
so when we have one hopefully being
 
04:27:11.830 --> 04:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
built in dairy
 
04:27:13.750 --> 04:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
will know a little bit later in the
 
04:27:13.760 --> 04:27:15.189 align:start position:0%
will know a little bit later in the
summer

04:27:15.189 --> 04:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
summer
 
04:27:17.590 --> 04:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
so it would be dairy that would
 
04:27:19.910 --> 04:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
provide them any funds that they could
 
04:27:21.750 --> 04:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
04:27:23.830 --> 04:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
or they could use it
 
04:27:27.830 --> 04:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
in other ways that meet the needs here
 
04:27:29.990 --> 04:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
senator khan yeah thank you mr chairman
 
04:27:32.790 --> 04:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh senator thanks for that question uh
 
04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
i i checked in on hampstead uh to see
 
04:27:39.750 --> 04:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
what kinds of uh
 
04:27:42.070 --> 04:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
indirect as well as direct assistance
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
the town was providing uh currently they
 
04:27:48.149 --> 04:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
are providing uh indirect assistance to
 
04:27:51.910 --> 04:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
homeless uh people through isaiah 58
 
04:27:55.590 --> 04:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
right through a community services uh
 
04:27:55.600 --> 04:27:56.950 align:start position:0%
right through a community services uh
organization

04:27:56.950 --> 04:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
organization
 
04:27:59.269 --> 04:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh and through the rockingham county
 
04:27:59.279 --> 04:28:00.469 align:start position:0%
uh and through the rockingham county
services

04:28:00.469 --> 04:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:28:00.479 --> 04:28:01.349 align:start position:0%
services
uh

04:28:01.349 --> 04:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:01.359 --> 04:28:02.309 align:start position:0%
uh
and

04:28:02.309 --> 04:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:28:05.110 --> 04:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so they uh
 
04:28:07.349 --> 04:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
they they demonstrated
 
04:28:09.510 --> 04:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
around a thirty million thirty thousand
 
04:28:11.429 --> 04:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
dollar uh
 
04:28:14.630 --> 04:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
expense out of the town's budget to
 
04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
support homelessness uh but not in a
 
04:28:19.510 --> 04:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
direct subsidy
 
04:28:22.790 --> 04:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
all politics is local representative
 
04:28:22.800 --> 04:28:24.630 align:start position:0%
all politics is local representative
edwards

04:28:24.630 --> 04:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
edwards
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
so um i i buy into the theory that
 
04:28:32.550 --> 04:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
um helping somebody at risk before they
 
04:28:34.710 --> 04:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
become homeless is preferable than
 
04:28:36.790 --> 04:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
waiting until they are homeless and have
 
04:28:38.790 --> 04:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
a much bigger problem i buy into that
 
04:28:42.309 --> 04:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
entirely so but it does make me curious
 
04:28:45.269 --> 04:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
about where the rubber meets the road
 
04:28:47.830 --> 04:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
when we start to tell these towns that
 
04:28:50.710 --> 04:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
they can help people at risk who are not
 
04:28:54.229 --> 04:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
homeless to help pay their mortgages
 
04:28:56.229 --> 04:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure that that's done
 
04:28:57.110 --> 04:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
in a
 
04:28:58.229 --> 04:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
fair way
 
04:29:00.870 --> 04:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's not biased towards their best
 
04:29:03.670 --> 04:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
friend of 20 years
 
04:29:07.750 --> 04:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
do we have guidance written today
 
04:29:10.389 --> 04:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
that would explain
 
04:29:14.870 --> 04:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
how to apply some fair process to
 
04:29:18.229 --> 04:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
determining who is at risk and how at
 
04:29:20.229 --> 04:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
risk they would be because if you're at
 
04:29:21.830 --> 04:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
risk you could be like
 
04:29:23.990 --> 04:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
crucially seriously like tomorrow at
 
04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
risk or you could be
 
04:29:28.469 --> 04:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
three months i may have a problem so so
 
04:29:31.349 --> 04:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
i i it just feels very hard to write
 
04:29:33.189 --> 04:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
guidance around that what what what have
 
04:29:35.269 --> 04:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
you been able to do so there's like
 
04:29:37.030 --> 04:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of things because i
 
04:29:39.510 --> 04:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
think each city and town has their own
 
04:29:41.670 --> 04:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines for how they provide welfare
 
04:29:43.110 --> 04:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
assistance and they have a welfare
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
officer and so that would come into play
 
04:29:47.910 --> 04:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
at the same time we're doing a lot of
 
04:29:50.550 --> 04:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
work with certain welfare directors in
 
04:29:52.550 --> 04:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
certain communities and providing
 
04:29:55.429 --> 04:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
support and guidance like we had one
 
04:29:57.750 --> 04:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
community that was re that reached out
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
to the department to say you know we're
 
04:30:01.349 --> 04:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
seeing an increased number of people
 
04:30:03.910 --> 04:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
needing assistance and so we actually
 
04:30:06.550 --> 04:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
partnered the department and a welfare
 
04:30:08.630 --> 04:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
director from a larger city met with
 
04:30:10.389 --> 04:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
that town and really helped give them
 
04:30:12.790 --> 04:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
some guidance and some ideas on how to
 
04:30:14.710 --> 04:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
follow so we would still have to follow
 
04:30:17.429 --> 04:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
whatever rules your city or town may
 
04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
have but i think by
 
04:30:21.830 --> 04:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
really working
 
04:30:24.630 --> 04:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
with the welfare directors around
 
04:30:27.429 --> 04:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
helping people stay in their homes i
 
04:30:29.429 --> 04:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
think that that is a little different in
 
04:30:32.950 --> 04:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
some communities than others
 
04:30:35.030 --> 04:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
did i answer your question
 
04:30:37.189 --> 04:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative edwards so it
 
04:30:39.910 --> 04:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like what you just said is
 
04:30:42.870 --> 04:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
that this is new state money that's
 
04:30:45.590 --> 04:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
going to the towns and that to the
 
04:30:47.590 --> 04:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
extent that they happen to have rules
 
04:30:49.910 --> 04:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
similar about helping at-risk people
 
04:30:51.910 --> 04:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
they could certainly use their own
 
04:30:54.870 --> 04:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines but at the state level we
 
04:30:57.830 --> 04:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
have not yet developed any guidelines on
 
04:31:00.630 --> 04:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
how to define at-risk and
 
04:31:02.710 --> 04:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
what kind of proportionality that that
 
04:31:05.510 --> 04:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
may justify in using state funds so we
 
04:31:05.520 --> 04:31:06.389 align:start position:0%
may justify in using state funds so we
could

04:31:06.389 --> 04:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:31:06.399 --> 04:31:07.510 align:start position:0%
could
um

04:31:07.510 --> 04:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:10.710 --> 04:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
we would be developing guidelines for
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
states for communities to follow
 
04:31:16.149 --> 04:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
but unless there's something added in
 
04:31:18.950 --> 04:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
here we don't have a lot of authority
 
04:31:21.910 --> 04:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
to say oh you used it inappropriately
 
04:31:24.870 --> 04:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
but we could put very strict guidelines
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
as to how you use it but yet we want to
 
04:31:29.349 --> 04:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
be careful that there's flexibility
 
04:31:33.750 --> 04:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
that that's the piece in senator khan
 
04:31:35.750 --> 04:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
04:31:38.309 --> 04:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:31:40.389 --> 04:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
i want to
 
04:31:42.950 --> 04:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
go a little bit further than
 
04:31:45.510 --> 04:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
represent edwards what he said about
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
at-risk i would
 
04:31:47.279 --> 04:31:48.389 align:start position:0%
at-risk i would
agree

04:31:48.389 --> 04:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
agree
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
that it's a
 
04:31:51.510 --> 04:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
very vague term
 
04:31:55.189 --> 04:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
and for me it's would be open to a lot
 
04:31:58.229 --> 04:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
of interpretation and that may be good
 
04:32:00.550 --> 04:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
or bad
 
04:32:01.830 --> 04:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the committee mentioned
 
04:32:03.830 --> 04:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
the budget process i do believe also
 
04:32:06.229 --> 04:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
that's the place for this
 
04:32:09.110 --> 04:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:13.110 --> 04:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:16.710 --> 04:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that was distributed
 
04:32:19.269 --> 04:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
when it talks about
 
04:32:21.269 --> 04:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
re-housing shelter
 
04:32:24.870 --> 04:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
and then it talks about landlords um
 
04:32:30.070 --> 04:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
i know there already exists multiple
 
04:32:35.110 --> 04:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
layers of
 
04:32:40.149 --> 04:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:43.429 --> 04:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
looking at eviction or
 
04:32:43.439 --> 04:32:45.590 align:start position:0%
looking at eviction or
whatever

04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:32:47.670 --> 04:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
and i can say the majority tenants that
 
04:32:49.750 --> 04:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
we had in the past were excellent
 
04:32:51.990 --> 04:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
tenants but i can also
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
say that
 
04:32:56.070 --> 04:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
there might have been some that i
 
04:32:58.389 --> 04:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
might not want the town
 
04:33:01.189 --> 04:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily helping and remain in one of
 
04:33:02.469 --> 04:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
our units
 
04:33:02.479 --> 04:33:03.269 align:start position:0%
our units
so

04:33:03.269 --> 04:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:05.429 --> 04:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
i think as a whole i i would prefer to
 
04:33:07.990 --> 04:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
see this in the budget process myself
 
04:33:08.000 --> 04:33:09.750 align:start position:0%
see this in the budget process myself
um

04:33:09.750 --> 04:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:11.750 --> 04:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
i have problems with the
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
the terms at risk and
 
04:33:15.830 --> 04:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
there i think there's some potential
 
04:33:17.750 --> 04:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
landlord issues there also thank you mr
 
04:33:17.760 --> 04:33:18.629 align:start position:0%
landlord issues there also thank you mr
chairman

04:33:18.629 --> 04:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:33:20.310 --> 04:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative the chair calls
 
04:33:22.709 --> 04:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
on representative hunt
 
04:33:26.230 --> 04:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
i just did want to say we could um use
 
04:33:28.869 --> 04:33:28.879 align:start position:0%
the hud guidelines um
 
04:33:30.789 --> 04:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
that are that outline for people
 
04:33:32.629 --> 04:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
experiencing homelessness so we would
 
04:33:35.109 --> 04:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
put that in any guidance thank you
 
04:33:37.990 --> 04:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative hunt yeah so um
 
04:33:40.949 --> 04:33:40.959 align:start position:0%
not that this is my issue at all
 
04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
but i have been on
 
04:33:46.709 --> 04:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh commute of conference before
 
04:33:48.629 --> 04:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
and uh and actually
 
04:33:51.910 --> 04:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
got got into trouble once
 
04:33:51.920 --> 04:33:52.949 align:start position:0%
got got into trouble once
when

04:33:52.949 --> 04:33:52.959 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:33:54.709 --> 04:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
we had a
 
04:33:57.269 --> 04:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
amendment that came in
 
04:34:01.590 --> 04:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
and the amendment was not in either the
 
04:34:05.109 --> 04:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
house or senate version
 
04:34:07.670 --> 04:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
that it was a new language completely
 
04:34:09.109 --> 04:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
and i assume
 
04:34:12.949 --> 04:34:12.959 align:start position:0%
is at risk is a new conversation item
 
04:34:14.310 --> 04:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:34:16.709 --> 04:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:16.719 --> 04:34:17.670 align:start position:0%
 
my

04:34:17.670 --> 04:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:34:20.629 --> 04:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
amendment they we was found at the by
 
04:34:22.470 --> 04:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
the speaker at the time
 
04:34:25.029 --> 04:34:25.039 align:start position:0%
that it was not permissible
 
04:34:27.590 --> 04:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
because it was not in either the house
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
or senate version it's a new material so
 
04:34:34.551 --> 04:34:34.561 align:start position:0%
whenever you introduce new material um
 
04:34:36.629 --> 04:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
it it jeopardizes the committee
 
04:34:39.029 --> 04:34:39.039 align:start position:0%
conference so so my understanding is we
 
04:34:39.039 --> 04:34:40.551 align:start position:0%
conference so so my understanding is we
cannot

04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
take up this amendment at all
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
because it's new new a new subject
 
04:34:48.949 --> 04:34:48.959 align:start position:0%
or new interpretation with this at-risk
 
04:34:51.590 --> 04:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
concept senator khan thank you mr
 
04:34:51.600 --> 04:34:53.109 align:start position:0%
concept senator khan thank you mr
chairman

04:34:53.109 --> 04:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
so if we want to go back to the words
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
that are in here it's homeless people
 
04:34:58.390 --> 04:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
seeking shelter
 
04:34:58.400 --> 04:34:59.590 align:start position:0%
seeking shelter
uh

04:34:59.590 --> 04:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:35:03.029 --> 04:35:03.039 align:start position:0%
and i'm fine with doing so i i think
 
04:35:04.551 --> 04:35:04.561 align:start position:0%
uh what
 
04:35:08.070 --> 04:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
the department is uh looking to do and i
 
04:35:09.189 --> 04:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
think what
 
04:35:12.310 --> 04:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
assists the local government
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:18.390 --> 04:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
04:35:18.400 --> 04:35:19.750 align:start position:0%
there is a
opportunity

04:35:19.750 --> 04:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:35:19.760 --> 04:35:20.789 align:start position:0%
opportunity
to

04:35:20.789 --> 04:35:20.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:35:25.029 --> 04:35:25.039 align:start position:0%
help people avoid the homeless situation
 
04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
can is there
 
04:35:28.551 --> 04:35:28.561 align:start position:0%
i mean we're talking about safety net
 
04:35:30.070 --> 04:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
issues here right
 
04:35:30.080 --> 04:35:30.949 align:start position:0%
issues here right
uh

04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:35:30.959 --> 04:35:31.910 align:start position:0%
uh
people

04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:35:34.629 --> 04:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
fall into homelessness i mean
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
they fell they've fallen through a
 
04:35:38.470 --> 04:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
safety net and we need to rebuild it
 
04:35:38.480 --> 04:35:39.510 align:start position:0%
safety net and we need to rebuild it
um

04:35:39.510 --> 04:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:40.949 --> 04:35:40.959 align:start position:0%
the safety net
 
04:35:43.990 --> 04:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh if it if it can be in place to help
 
04:35:45.670 --> 04:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
people from falling
 
04:35:48.470 --> 04:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh then that's terrific
 
04:35:50.310 --> 04:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
right there's some legitimacy to the
 
04:35:50.320 --> 04:35:51.269 align:start position:0%
right there's some legitimacy to the
question

04:35:51.269 --> 04:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:35:53.830 --> 04:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
raised about a local community
 
04:35:56.150 --> 04:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
will they how will they exercise that
 
04:35:58.070 --> 04:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
decision about at-risk
 
04:35:59.750 --> 04:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
but i think that what the department is
 
04:36:02.070 --> 04:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
doing here with this last line that
 
04:36:04.310 --> 04:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to use their relationship
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
with local welfare administrators
 
04:36:08.470 --> 04:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
association a body which actually does
 
04:36:12.150 --> 04:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
exist and is entirely populated by
 
04:36:12.160 --> 04:36:12.949 align:start position:0%
exist and is entirely populated by
uh

04:36:12.949 --> 04:36:12.959 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:36:12.959 --> 04:36:14.390 align:start position:0%
uh
community

04:36:14.390 --> 04:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:36:14.400 --> 04:36:15.990 align:start position:0%
community
welfare

04:36:15.990 --> 04:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
welfare
 
04:36:16.000 --> 04:36:18.869 align:start position:0%
welfare
officers

04:36:18.869 --> 04:36:18.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:21.429 --> 04:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
that that they will develop these best
 
04:36:24.949 --> 04:36:24.959 align:start position:0%
practices for use and i guess i come
 
04:36:26.551 --> 04:36:26.561 align:start position:0%
back to one
 
04:36:28.070 --> 04:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
we did consider this in the budget
 
04:36:31.189 --> 04:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
process we assumed we we
 
04:36:33.189 --> 04:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
legislated that there were not the
 
04:36:36.150 --> 04:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
dollars until we came to this point
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
04:36:39.830 --> 04:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
many items that we're going to face as
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
we come out of this legislative session
 
04:36:44.390 --> 04:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
adding dollars to
 
04:36:47.109 --> 04:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
that we weren't unable to do in our
 
04:36:49.830 --> 04:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
original budget allocation for this
 
04:36:52.869 --> 04:36:52.879 align:start position:0%
biennium this is not an isolated
 
04:36:52.879 --> 04:36:53.990 align:start position:0%
biennium this is not an isolated
instance

04:36:53.990 --> 04:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
instance
 
04:36:57.670 --> 04:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh number one number two um
 
04:36:59.029 --> 04:36:59.039 align:start position:0%
we're trying
 
04:37:00.869 --> 04:37:00.879 align:start position:0%
something different here
 
04:37:00.879 --> 04:37:01.830 align:start position:0%
something different here
if

04:37:01.830 --> 04:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:37:04.629 --> 04:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
by allocating only to shelters
 
04:37:07.750 --> 04:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
to answer the issue of homelessness or
 
04:37:10.230 --> 04:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
at risk of homeless
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't reach enough
 
04:37:15.510 --> 04:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
people in our state doesn't reach enough
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
communities is not providing local
 
04:37:21.670 --> 04:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
relief to local governments in a
 
04:37:23.429 --> 04:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
sufficient way
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
then this is the way to do it
 
04:37:28.629 --> 04:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
distributing dollars on a fair basis
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
across every community allows every
 
04:37:33.910 --> 04:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
community that determination as to how
 
04:37:37.109 --> 04:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
to best use these dollars so
 
04:37:39.830 --> 04:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
i i i'm coming back around to you know
 
04:37:42.150 --> 04:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
the main point here and
 
04:37:43.429 --> 04:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
i hope that
 
04:37:45.429 --> 04:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
we can get to the place of supporting
 
04:37:47.510 --> 04:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment thank you a few questions
 
04:37:49.510 --> 04:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
for me number one is there anything to
 
04:37:49.520 --> 04:37:50.949 align:start position:0%
for me number one is there anything to
prevent

04:37:50.949 --> 04:37:50.959 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
04:37:52.869 --> 04:37:52.879 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
04:37:54.629 --> 04:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
generating the dollar amounts that are
 
04:37:56.949 --> 04:37:56.959 align:start position:0%
listed if they saw that there was a
 
04:37:58.949 --> 04:37:58.959 align:start position:0%
homeless problem in their town and they
 
04:38:03.029 --> 04:38:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.039 --> 04:38:04.629 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:38:04.629 --> 04:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:38:06.470 --> 04:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think there is anything
 
04:38:08.789 --> 04:38:08.799 align:start position:0%
preventing i think what we
 
04:38:10.709 --> 04:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
are anticipating what we can see in
 
04:38:13.670 --> 04:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
front of us right now there is a bubble
 
04:38:17.910 --> 04:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
and can we provide enough housing
 
04:38:21.510 --> 04:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
where that can be relieved and right now
 
04:38:23.029 --> 04:38:23.039 align:start position:0%
we are facing
 
04:38:25.990 --> 04:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
housing people in in hotels
 
04:38:27.670 --> 04:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
and in shelters that
 
04:38:29.830 --> 04:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
need additional space and and some
 
04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
renovation these are the way this is a
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%
mechanism to get the dollars to the
 
04:38:36.629 --> 04:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
towns for them to
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
either directly provide the assistance
 
04:38:41.910 --> 04:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
or to participate along with other towns
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
to get that assistance provided which
 
04:38:45.750 --> 04:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
begs my question about whether if the
 
04:38:47.590 --> 04:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
money is not given to the towns the
 
04:38:49.990 --> 04:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
towns cannot put it in their budget or
 
04:38:52.869 --> 04:38:52.879 align:start position:0%
out of their reserve or rainy day fund
 
04:38:54.949 --> 04:38:54.959 align:start position:0%
and i believe my answer would be of
 
04:38:56.629 --> 04:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
course they can
 
04:38:59.029 --> 04:38:59.039 align:start position:0%
my second question is um
 
04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
i don't remember was there a hearing on
 
04:39:02.789 --> 04:39:02.799 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:39:04.551 --> 04:39:04.561 align:start position:0%
in the house did it go to a policy
 
04:39:04.561 --> 04:39:08.709 align:start position:0%
in the house did it go to a policy
committee

04:39:08.709 --> 04:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
i know that it went to the finance
 
04:39:13.109 --> 04:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
committee and i guess i'm
 
04:39:14.551 --> 04:39:14.561 align:start position:0%
going to need some
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:19.590 --> 04:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
because representative pearson likely
 
04:39:23.269 --> 04:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:24.390 --> 04:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
not really
 
04:39:26.789 --> 04:39:26.799 align:start position:0%
well the the underlying bill started off
 
04:39:28.949 --> 04:39:28.959 align:start position:0%
as a senate bill eventually was tabled
 
04:39:29.869 --> 04:39:29.879 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
re-inserted into the bill in front of
 
04:39:35.830 --> 04:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
you uh hb 1662 at the most recent uh
 
04:39:37.510 --> 04:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
senate session so to my knowledge at
 
04:39:39.910 --> 04:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
least the underlying bill that was filed
 
04:39:43.270 --> 04:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh as prime sponsor by senator khan
 
04:39:45.430 --> 04:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
did not um have a hearing here in the
 
04:39:45.440 --> 04:39:46.550 align:start position:0%
did not um have a hearing here in the
house

04:39:46.550 --> 04:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:39:46.560 --> 04:39:47.430 align:start position:0%
house
okay

04:39:47.430 --> 04:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:39:49.350 --> 04:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
but if there's another bill i
 
04:39:51.350 --> 04:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
i don't have knowledge of that i think
 
04:39:53.350 --> 04:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
the way that i was
 
04:39:56.230 --> 04:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
anticipating some response is that in
 
04:39:56.240 --> 04:39:57.910 align:start position:0%
anticipating some response is that in
2002

04:39:57.910 --> 04:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
2002
 
04:40:00.390 --> 04:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
when the department uh proposed
 
04:40:02.470 --> 04:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
additional funding for
 
04:40:06.708 --> 04:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:09.910 --> 04:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:13.350 --> 04:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:13.360 --> 04:40:15.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:40:15.430 --> 04:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:40:17.350 --> 04:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
instead of truth yeah as part of our
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
budget request yes okay that's how it
 
04:40:22.948 --> 04:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:25.430 --> 04:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
senator carson
 
04:40:28.390 --> 04:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i have
 
04:40:31.510 --> 04:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of questions um and i want to
 
04:40:34.150 --> 04:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
understand what the dialogue here is
 
04:40:35.190 --> 04:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
going on
 
04:40:37.030 --> 04:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
because you had asked about local
 
04:40:39.510 --> 04:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
resources to address the issue of
 
04:40:39.520 --> 04:40:41.110 align:start position:0%
resources to address the issue of
homelessness

04:40:41.110 --> 04:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
04:40:43.350 --> 04:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
versus getting a grant from the state
 
04:40:44.708 --> 04:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
for homelessness
 
04:40:47.310 --> 04:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that
 
04:40:47.320 --> 04:40:49.030 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that
municipalities

04:40:49.030 --> 04:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:40:52.230 --> 04:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
raise local property taxes in order to
 
04:40:55.030 --> 04:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
get the money to fund a homeless problem
 
04:40:56.788 --> 04:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
they have in their community
 
04:40:59.830 --> 04:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
versus getting a state grant
 
04:40:59.840 --> 04:41:01.270 align:start position:0%
versus getting a state grant
no

04:41:01.270 --> 04:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:41:02.948 --> 04:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
okay could you clarify
 
04:41:06.070 --> 04:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
that please because very often certain
 
04:41:08.550 --> 04:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
line items go down and certain light
 
04:41:11.270 --> 04:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
items go up depending on a whole variety
 
04:41:12.390 --> 04:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
of things
 
04:41:14.310 --> 04:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
and to say
 
04:41:15.990 --> 04:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
the money that would have come from the
 
04:41:18.150 --> 04:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
state needs to be generated locally does
 
04:41:22.390 --> 04:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
not require in itself property taxes to
 
04:41:23.430 --> 04:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
go up
 
04:41:25.270 --> 04:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
because some other things may go down
 
04:41:27.750 --> 04:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just simply saying can the towns not
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
assume more of the local welfare needs
 
04:41:33.590 --> 04:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's all i'm asking okay thank you um
 
04:41:35.270 --> 04:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
i live in hampstead and pay property
 
04:41:37.190 --> 04:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
taxes which are way too high i think we
 
04:41:39.510 --> 04:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
all do so
 
04:41:41.030 --> 04:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer the second
 
04:41:42.470 --> 04:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
question that i have and it's it's
 
04:41:44.070 --> 04:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion concerning about the
 
04:41:44.080 --> 04:41:45.270 align:start position:0%
suggestion concerning about the
procedure

04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
04:41:47.830 --> 04:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
um in the senate this bill was brought
 
04:41:49.990 --> 04:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
forward during a senate session
 
04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
we had a great debate and a discussion
 
04:41:54.628 --> 04:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
about this particular issue and it was
 
04:41:56.628 --> 04:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
voted on by the full senate i believe it
 
04:42:00.150 --> 04:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
passed 24 to nothing but i think if the
 
04:42:01.910 --> 04:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
house has questions about
 
04:42:04.550 --> 04:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
the procedure what i'd like to suggest
 
04:42:06.868 --> 04:42:06.878 align:start position:0%
mr chair is that we take a break
 
04:42:08.948 --> 04:42:08.958 align:start position:0%
and that you consult with the house
 
04:42:08.958 --> 04:42:09.830 align:start position:0%
and that you consult with the house
clerk

04:42:09.830 --> 04:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
04:42:11.910 --> 04:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you are following your
 
04:42:11.920 --> 04:42:13.190 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you are following your
procedures

04:42:13.190 --> 04:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
04:42:14.230 --> 04:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
and i don't
 
04:42:16.470 --> 04:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
i'm asking my researcher if she would
 
04:42:18.788 --> 04:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
find out if this bill did come over to
 
04:42:18.798 --> 04:42:21.990 align:start position:0%
find out if this bill did come over to
us

04:42:21.990 --> 04:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:23.670 --> 04:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative enforcing what you're
 
04:42:25.270 --> 04:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
just saying is
 
04:42:26.708 --> 04:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
that they'll rule
 
04:42:29.670 --> 04:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
this is a non-tremaine amendment
 
04:42:31.910 --> 04:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
ingenious in a sense to the committee of
 
04:42:33.430 --> 04:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
conference because
 
04:42:33.440 --> 04:42:34.868 align:start position:0%
conference because
neither

04:42:34.868 --> 04:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
neither
 
04:42:36.708 --> 04:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
house or senate version
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
had this language
 
04:42:40.628 --> 04:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
so we i'm arguing
 
04:42:42.470 --> 04:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm arguing that we could never
 
04:42:44.868 --> 04:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
take up this amendment because it wasn't
 
04:42:47.670 --> 04:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
even in your version
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
they're saying if it was in your version
 
04:42:51.750 --> 04:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
if you had amended this
 
04:42:53.590 --> 04:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
when you amended this you know this bill
 
04:42:55.830 --> 04:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
and added the this whole section in the
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
bill if you had added this at that time
 
04:42:59.910 --> 04:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
it would be drained because you guys
 
04:43:02.150 --> 04:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
have rules that allow you anything but
 
04:43:04.948 --> 04:43:04.958 align:start position:0%
this is all new language here right this
 
04:43:06.310 --> 04:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
it's been in particular i'm just
 
04:43:08.470 --> 04:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
thinking i was you know sitting here and
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's at risk there's a whole new
 
04:43:10.080 --> 04:43:11.510 align:start position:0%
there's at risk there's a whole new
concept

04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
concept
 
04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
so that is i'm arguing that that our
 
04:43:16.230 --> 04:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
clerk would rule that this is not this
 
04:43:19.030 --> 04:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
cannot be permitted in the committee
 
04:43:21.190 --> 04:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
conference report when my researcher
 
04:43:22.708 --> 04:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
comes back with the answer to the first
 
04:43:24.868 --> 04:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
question i'll ask her to go ask that
 
04:43:44.788 --> 04:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:44.798 --> 04:43:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:43:57.270 --> 04:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:59.750 --> 04:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
for a moment we do have the wording that
 
04:44:02.390 --> 04:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
is on page four of
 
04:44:05.910 --> 04:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:07.830 --> 04:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise you would withdraw this and
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:16.070 --> 04:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
yes if it's not timely to introduce it i
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
just thought that it maybe added some
 
04:44:20.390 --> 04:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
clarification to
 
04:44:21.670 --> 04:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh okay
 
04:44:23.430 --> 04:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
at least that the department wanted to
 
04:44:25.190 --> 04:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
have here while we're waiting for the
 
04:44:27.350 --> 04:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
clerk to come over um representative
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
turcotte did you wish to jump in at this
 
04:44:31.990 --> 04:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
point on this point
 
04:44:33.990 --> 04:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman
 
04:44:36.550 --> 04:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
um so it's my understanding i want to
 
04:44:39.830 --> 04:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:44.470 --> 04:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
this although this amendment to 1662
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
starting on page
 
04:44:50.948 --> 04:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
bottom of five on the bottom of five
 
04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
and continuing on with all the dollar
 
04:44:56.470 --> 04:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
distribution levels
 
04:44:59.510 --> 04:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
this passed the house but never was
 
04:45:01.350 --> 04:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
voted on
 
04:45:04.230 --> 04:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh past the senate but was never
 
04:45:06.310 --> 04:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
voted on by the house is that correct
 
04:45:08.830 --> 04:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
never heard i don't recall this thank
 
04:45:11.590 --> 04:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
you and the clerk of the house will be
 
04:45:13.670 --> 04:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
over very shortly to
 
04:45:16.230 --> 04:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.628 --> 04:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh and since we
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
have some dead air here while we're
 
04:45:22.550 --> 04:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
waiting i i
 
04:45:24.868 --> 04:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
as i'm listening to this i'm thinking
 
04:45:27.270 --> 04:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
what a fascinating policy discussion
 
04:45:29.830 --> 04:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
this is and that if only we had a
 
04:45:32.470 --> 04:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
committee in the house that was good at
 
04:45:34.868 --> 04:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
reviewing this sort of policy
 
04:45:36.788 --> 04:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
maybe they could have looked at it and
 
04:45:39.110 --> 04:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
provided a recommendation to the finance
 
04:45:41.670 --> 04:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
committee to whether we could consider
 
04:45:43.510 --> 04:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
funding it or not and
 
04:45:45.350 --> 04:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
and then i would i would also want to
 
04:45:49.110 --> 04:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
just add that we are months weeks away
 
04:45:51.510 --> 04:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
from starting another budget phase and
 
04:45:53.350 --> 04:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
that maybe
 
04:45:55.830 --> 04:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
maybe this could be brought into the
 
04:46:01.110 --> 04:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
you do know the speaker said he would
 
04:46:05.110 --> 04:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
afflict bodily harm on me if i approved
 
04:46:06.868 --> 04:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
yet the establishment of another
 
04:46:08.948 --> 04:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
commission or committee
 
04:46:11.350 --> 04:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not asking for that oh good i'm
 
04:46:12.788 --> 04:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
asking for let's
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
we've got a budget
 
04:46:14.160 --> 04:46:15.190 align:start position:0%
we've got a budget
okay

04:46:15.190 --> 04:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:46:17.190 --> 04:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
well that was the second half of yeah
 
04:46:31.510 --> 04:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:33.110 --> 04:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
i think you'll probably come in about
 
04:46:34.708 --> 04:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
two seconds into doing that
 
04:46:37.910 --> 04:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative so if i may i i i just
 
04:46:40.150 --> 04:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
you know i i worked with senator khan
 
04:46:41.750 --> 04:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
for a long time i have tremendous
 
04:46:43.350 --> 04:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
respect for him this sounds like a
 
04:46:45.350 --> 04:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
really great program i like saving
 
04:46:47.590 --> 04:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
people at risk before they go over the
 
04:46:47.600 --> 04:46:48.628 align:start position:0%
people at risk before they go over the
cliff

04:46:48.628 --> 04:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
cliff
 
04:46:50.550 --> 04:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
but i i just think this is a major
 
04:46:53.430 --> 04:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
policy issue for which the house
 
04:46:54.708 --> 04:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
has never
 
04:46:55.910 --> 04:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
visited it
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
and that it would be appropriate for the
 
04:47:01.350 --> 04:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
hhs committee to set this kind of policy
 
04:47:03.270 --> 04:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
um and and not have it done in a
 
04:47:06.390 --> 04:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
committee a conference i
 
04:47:08.788 --> 04:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
all right so so that's i'm i'm a leaning
 
04:47:10.628 --> 04:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
now all right uh clerk of the house
 
04:47:12.708 --> 04:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
would you come forward please because we
 
04:47:17.030 --> 04:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
are asking for a few rulings on things
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes
 
04:47:20.628 --> 04:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if we could hold for a few
 
04:47:22.230 --> 04:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
minutes because i have called the senate
 
04:47:24.868 --> 04:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
clerk and she is on her way over as well
 
04:47:27.910 --> 04:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
well the senate clerk can come too
 
04:47:29.430 --> 04:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't think they'll be speaking at
 
04:47:30.550 --> 04:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
once but
 
04:47:32.230 --> 04:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
no and i'd like to bring up the point
 
04:47:33.670 --> 04:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
that it's my understanding in a
 
04:47:35.670 --> 04:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
committee a conference this morning an
 
04:47:37.510 --> 04:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
amendment was adopted and approved by
 
04:47:40.230 --> 04:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
both sides so um i think we just need to
 
04:47:41.590 --> 04:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
get some clarification on this
 
04:47:43.750 --> 04:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
particular issue it's my understanding
 
04:47:43.760 --> 04:47:44.390 align:start position:0%
particular issue it's my understanding
that

04:47:44.390 --> 04:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:47:46.708 --> 04:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
this has been done many many many times
 
04:47:48.948 --> 04:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
in the past but since the issue has been
 
04:47:50.628 --> 04:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
brought up i think we need a ruling from
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
both sides thank you i agree with you
 
04:47:55.510 --> 04:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
and i see we have two very different but
 
04:47:57.990 --> 04:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
parallel issues here one should we do
 
04:47:58.000 --> 04:47:58.868 align:start position:0%
parallel issues here one should we do
this

04:47:58.868 --> 04:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:48:00.868 --> 04:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
and secondly may we do this and they're
 
04:48:02.788 --> 04:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
separate issues
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
if we may do this we don't necessarily
 
04:48:07.350 --> 04:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
want to do this we could
 
04:48:07.360 --> 04:48:08.070 align:start position:0%
want to do this we could
but

04:48:08.070 --> 04:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:48:10.830 --> 04:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
if it is ruled out of order
 
04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
by certainly since i represent the
 
04:48:15.830 --> 04:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
house's side i'm introduced interested
 
04:48:17.750 --> 04:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
in hearing what the clerk of the house
 
04:48:20.070 --> 04:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
has to say and if it's not kosher to him
 
04:48:22.070 --> 04:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
then it won't be kosher to me even
 
04:48:24.150 --> 04:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
though your clerk may make it kosher for
 
04:48:24.160 --> 04:48:25.430 align:start position:0%
though your clerk may make it kosher for
you

04:48:25.430 --> 04:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:48:28.150 --> 04:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
and then once that dust is settled it's
 
04:48:29.990 --> 04:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
do we want to do this or say no wait to
 
04:49:02.788 --> 04:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:44.708 --> 04:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:47.910 --> 04:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the house rules that we may
 
04:52:49.670 --> 04:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
do this
 
04:52:52.150 --> 04:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
so the question then becomes do we wish
 
04:52:52.160 --> 04:52:53.510 align:start position:0%
so the question then becomes do we wish
to

04:52:53.510 --> 04:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:52:56.628 --> 04:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
and i think we've discussed that
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
very thoroughly
 
04:53:02.070 --> 04:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
and i would ask the senate
 
04:53:04.628 --> 04:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
do you wish to i think it would be
 
04:53:06.230 --> 04:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
obvious do you wish to defend the
 
04:53:07.830 --> 04:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
senate's position
 
04:53:11.430 --> 04:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:11.440 --> 04:53:14.788 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:53:14.788 --> 04:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:16.708 --> 04:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
i would presume you would but i would
 
04:53:18.310 --> 04:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
want to hear it
 
04:53:20.788 --> 04:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
senator carson we're we're moving on to
 
04:53:23.910 --> 04:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
vote uh on the issue of
 
04:53:25.830 --> 04:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
this second part of the bill and the
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
question is do you with your senate
 
04:53:32.788 --> 04:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
colleagues wish to defend the um
 
04:53:35.270 --> 04:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
senate's position on this yes
 
04:53:37.030 --> 04:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
all right now the house
 
04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
yeah the the house representative
 
04:53:41.910 --> 04:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
turcotte yay or nay
 
04:53:41.920 --> 04:53:42.948 align:start position:0%
turcotte yay or nay
nay

04:53:42.948 --> 04:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
nay
 
04:53:45.670 --> 04:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
representative hunt um i clearly this
 
04:53:47.190 --> 04:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
needs to go to a committee before we
 
04:53:50.150 --> 04:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
could vote on so i would say nay
 
04:53:51.990 --> 04:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay but that kills it then a great
 
04:53:53.830 --> 04:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
potential policy
 
04:53:57.110 --> 04:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
worthy of hhs
 
04:53:59.430 --> 04:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
and i would say the same kind of thing
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
much needed wrong way to do it so
 
04:54:05.350 --> 04:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
the house position is no so therefore
 
04:54:06.788 --> 04:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
section two
 
04:54:09.910 --> 04:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
will is has been voted out mr chairman
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to request
 
04:54:13.270 --> 04:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
senate take
 
04:54:16.390 --> 04:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
a a break
 
04:54:19.110 --> 04:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
so we can uh discuss the rest of the
 
04:54:19.120 --> 04:54:19.990 align:start position:0%
so we can uh discuss the rest of the
bill

04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%

to say add-on but i don't mean that
 
05:25:47.280 --> 05:25:48.788 align:start position:0%
to say add-on but i don't mean that
pejoratively

05:25:48.788 --> 05:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
pejoratively
 
05:25:51.830 --> 05:25:51.840 align:start position:0%

05:25:53.750 --> 05:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
from the senate about uh
 
05:25:56.868 --> 05:25:56.878 align:start position:0%

05:26:00.070 --> 05:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um and i

05:26:01.200 --> 05:26:02.150 align:start position:0%
appreciate
your

05:26:02.150 --> 05:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:26:02.160 --> 05:26:03.830 align:start position:0%
your
um

05:26:03.830 --> 05:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:03.840 --> 05:26:04.948 align:start position:0%
um
you're

05:26:04.948 --> 05:26:04.958 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:26:07.910 --> 05:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
letting me speak about this bill um
 
05:26:10.390 --> 05:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
this bill i think is something that we
 
05:26:13.270 --> 05:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
really need to do we are far far far
 
05:26:15.430 --> 05:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
behind the times when it comes to
 
05:26:18.310 --> 05:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
electronic payment of wages and so this
 
05:26:21.350 --> 05:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
bill really permits employers to pay
 
05:26:24.548 --> 05:26:24.558 align:start position:0%
those wages electronically
 
05:26:26.948 --> 05:26:26.958 align:start position:0%
we already allow people to have
 
05:26:28.708 --> 05:26:28.718 align:start position:0%
especially if you get
 
05:26:30.788 --> 05:26:30.798 align:start position:0%
any kind of federal subsidy
 
05:26:33.430 --> 05:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
money is goes from one to the other
 
05:26:36.948 --> 05:26:36.958 align:start position:0%
right into a direct deposit that the um
 
05:26:38.480 --> 05:26:38.490 align:start position:0%
that the recipient
 
05:26:38.490 --> 05:26:39.910 align:start position:0%
that the recipient
[Music]

05:26:39.910 --> 05:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:26:43.110 --> 05:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
designates and so this mr chairman just
 
05:26:45.350 --> 05:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
goes along those lines there's a couple
 
05:26:46.470 --> 05:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
of sta
 
05:26:48.868 --> 05:26:48.878 align:start position:0%
points i'd like to make most states in
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
the united states already allow
 
05:26:53.990 --> 05:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
um this to go on and if any of you have
 
05:26:54.000 --> 05:26:54.788 align:start position:0%
um this to go on and if any of you have
seen

05:26:54.788 --> 05:26:54.798 align:start position:0%
seen
 
05:26:58.310 --> 05:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh the chime commercials out there
 
05:27:00.868 --> 05:27:00.878 align:start position:0%
where they advertise you know a company
 
05:27:03.590 --> 05:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
that you can get the money
 
05:27:07.350 --> 05:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
a day or two prior to actually
 
05:27:09.590 --> 05:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
receiving a paper check it's
 
05:27:11.670 --> 05:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
automatically put into your account and
 
05:27:15.430 --> 05:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's available for people to use
 
05:27:18.470 --> 05:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
again 29 states permit electronic page
 
05:27:21.350 --> 05:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
layman's there's no complaints
 
05:27:23.750 --> 05:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
employees tend to quickly adapt and are
 
05:27:25.990 --> 05:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
awful and often very thankful for the
 
05:27:28.948 --> 05:27:28.958 align:start position:0%
ability to have this
 
05:27:30.948 --> 05:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
they would like to be able to choose
 
05:27:32.390 --> 05:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
between direct
 
05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
deposit or payroll cards at any time
 
05:27:37.110 --> 05:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
and employers
 
05:27:39.110 --> 05:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
prefer this because now
 
05:27:41.350 --> 05:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
you they're really not dependent upon
 
05:27:44.230 --> 05:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
anyone receiving a paper check it's not
 
05:27:47.110 --> 05:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
saying that an employee cannot request a
 
05:27:50.150 --> 05:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
paper check they can but
 
05:27:53.830 --> 05:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
most employees would prefer to receive
 
05:27:56.868 --> 05:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
some sort of an electronic card
 
05:27:59.110 --> 05:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
again the point most payments are
 
05:28:01.510 --> 05:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
already electronic virtually all
 
05:28:03.030 --> 05:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
government payments are paid
 
05:28:03.040 --> 05:28:04.628 align:start position:0%
government payments are paid
electronically

05:28:04.628 --> 05:28:04.638 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
05:28:07.510 --> 05:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
tax refunds unemployment social security
 
05:28:09.910 --> 05:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
nutrition assistance disability
 
05:28:13.990 --> 05:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
etc 93 of american workers are already
 
05:28:16.390 --> 05:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
paid via direct deposit
 
05:28:16.400 --> 05:28:17.510 align:start position:0%
paid via direct deposit
um

05:28:17.510 --> 05:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:19.990 --> 05:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
just a little factoid mo european
 
05:28:22.150 --> 05:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
workers have not seen a paper paycheck
 
05:28:24.310 --> 05:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
in decades
 
05:28:26.470 --> 05:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
government employees are generally all
 
05:28:28.948 --> 05:28:28.958 align:start position:0%
paid electronically and it's only really
 
05:28:31.590 --> 05:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
the private sector employees
 
05:28:34.150 --> 05:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
remain mired in wage payment laws better
 
05:28:36.548 --> 05:28:36.558 align:start position:0%
suited to the 1940s
 
05:28:40.150 --> 05:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
so in talking about payroll cards
 
05:28:42.470 --> 05:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
they can use them any place that they
 
05:28:44.470 --> 05:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
would use a check
 
05:28:46.708 --> 05:28:46.718 align:start position:0%
there's free online bill payment in
 
05:28:48.948 --> 05:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
internet shopping there's no charges for
 
05:28:48.958 --> 05:28:50.708 align:start position:0%
internet shopping there's no charges for
those

05:28:50.708 --> 05:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:28:53.430 --> 05:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
travel oftentimes requires electronic
 
05:28:55.190 --> 05:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
payment for flights
 
05:28:58.230 --> 05:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
hotels rental cars etc there are
 
05:29:00.628 --> 05:29:00.638 align:start position:0%
protections from fraud and unauthorized
 
05:29:03.750 --> 05:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
use and a dispute resolution process in
 
05:29:06.628 --> 05:29:06.638 align:start position:0%
place they can't be overdrafted
 
05:29:08.788 --> 05:29:08.798 align:start position:0%
so there's no fees
 
05:29:11.190 --> 05:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
and they often include free savings
 
05:29:13.270 --> 05:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
account and additional cards for family
 
05:29:13.280 --> 05:29:15.510 align:start position:0%
account and additional cards for family
members

05:29:15.510 --> 05:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
members
 
05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
this bill passed
 
05:29:19.270 --> 05:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
05:29:19.280 --> 05:29:20.310 align:start position:0%
the senate
and

05:29:20.310 --> 05:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:29:23.510 --> 05:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
it went over to the house and the house
 
05:29:24.788 --> 05:29:24.798 align:start position:0%
heard it and
 
05:29:27.430 --> 05:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
they made the motion of interim study
 
05:29:29.670 --> 05:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
so the senate feels very strongly about
 
05:29:31.830 --> 05:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
this bill it's time that we
 
05:29:33.750 --> 05:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
join the modern age
 
05:29:36.470 --> 05:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we can
 
05:29:38.788 --> 05:29:38.798 align:start position:0%
talk about this and see if we can get
 
05:29:41.190 --> 05:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
this passed thank you mr chair yes
 
05:29:43.510 --> 05:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
question to the senator most of my
 
05:29:43.520 --> 05:29:45.270 align:start position:0%
question to the senator most of my
employees

05:29:45.270 --> 05:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
employees
 
05:29:48.070 --> 05:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
already have direct deposit of their
 
05:29:51.190 --> 05:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
paycheck into their bank account so what
 
05:29:52.868 --> 05:29:52.878 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing that
 
05:29:54.548 --> 05:29:54.558 align:start position:0%
we need this for some very special
 
05:29:57.430 --> 05:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
reason and my people already get this
 
05:29:59.590 --> 05:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
what am i missing thank you for the
 
05:30:01.750 --> 05:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
question mr chair it really gives the
 
05:30:01.760 --> 05:30:03.350 align:start position:0%
question mr chair it really gives the
employee

05:30:03.350 --> 05:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
employee
 
05:30:05.590 --> 05:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
choice about how they want to receive
 
05:30:08.708 --> 05:30:08.718 align:start position:0%
their paycheck um some people don't want
 
05:30:10.230 --> 05:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
to deal with a bank
 
05:30:13.030 --> 05:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
they don't want to deal with um paying
 
05:30:15.350 --> 05:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
fees everything else to a bank
 
05:30:17.510 --> 05:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
um some people just don't want to have
 
05:30:19.350 --> 05:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
credit cards either
 
05:30:21.430 --> 05:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
um so they would like to get something
 
05:30:22.948 --> 05:30:22.958 align:start position:0%
like this where the money is
 
05:30:25.910 --> 05:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
automatically taken out um everything is
 
05:30:28.868 --> 05:30:28.878 align:start position:0%
online where they can go at any point
 
05:30:31.990 --> 05:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
and look to see what their balances are
 
05:30:34.948 --> 05:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
it's just another an alternative way to
 
05:30:38.150 --> 05:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
pay people my employees have this now
 
05:30:38.160 --> 05:30:38.868 align:start position:0%
pay people my employees have this now
they

05:30:38.868 --> 05:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:30:40.868 --> 05:30:40.878 align:start position:0%
they would have direct deposit but they
 
05:30:43.110 --> 05:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
would have the option of having a pay
 
05:30:43.120 --> 05:30:44.070 align:start position:0%
would have the option of having a pay
card

05:30:44.070 --> 05:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
card
 
05:30:45.990 --> 05:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
what is a pay card is i know what a
 
05:30:48.310 --> 05:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
check is i know what direct deposit is
 
05:30:50.548 --> 05:30:50.558 align:start position:0%
what is a paid card a pay card is just
 
05:30:52.628 --> 05:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
like a card that you would get
 
05:30:54.948 --> 05:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
for like your debit card
 
05:30:57.830 --> 05:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
and your paycheck is loaded onto that
 
05:31:02.788 --> 05:31:02.798 align:start position:0%
card instead of sending it to the bank
 
05:31:04.708 --> 05:31:04.718 align:start position:0%
it's loaded onto the card
 
05:31:07.430 --> 05:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
like a donkey donuts card
 
05:31:09.750 --> 05:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
where you buy it and then every time you
 
05:31:12.070 --> 05:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
go i this i'm only hearing about this i
 
05:31:13.990 --> 05:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
don't do this but you go through the
 
05:31:16.230 --> 05:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
drive through and you hand them the card
 
05:31:18.390 --> 05:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
and it debits down what you just your
 
05:31:21.510 --> 05:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
triple mocha latte aposino thing that
 
05:31:23.910 --> 05:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
you just bought and now your card
 
05:31:26.628 --> 05:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
shrinks in value is it like that okay so
 
05:31:28.470 --> 05:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
it's like a donkey kong that's right but
 
05:31:30.070 --> 05:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh wow well you could buy a lot of
 
05:31:32.788 --> 05:31:32.798 align:start position:0%
dunkin donuts with your paycheck but
 
05:31:35.670 --> 05:31:35.680 align:start position:0%

it's the money is always readily
 
05:31:43.030 --> 05:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
accessible to you you're saying the
 
05:31:45.350 --> 05:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
third option this brings in is a pay
 
05:31:47.670 --> 05:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
card like that okay thank you i got it
 
05:31:51.510 --> 05:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
now okay senator birdsall um i would
 
05:31:54.470 --> 05:31:54.480 align:start position:0%

um your paycheck is loaded back on much
 
05:31:59.430 --> 05:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
like an ebt card works
 
05:32:01.590 --> 05:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
the government every week
 
05:32:02.868 --> 05:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
puts your
 
05:32:06.070 --> 05:32:06.080 align:start position:0%

this bill did come over from the senate
 
05:32:27.670 --> 05:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
um to our labor committee
 
05:32:29.990 --> 05:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
on which i sit
 
05:32:34.628 --> 05:32:34.638 align:start position:0%
um we over a couple weeks in several
 
05:32:36.470 --> 05:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
05:32:36.480 --> 05:32:37.270 align:start position:0%
public hearings
we

05:32:37.270 --> 05:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:32:39.190 --> 05:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
looked at this
 
05:32:39.200 --> 05:32:40.548 align:start position:0%
looked at this
particular

05:32:40.548 --> 05:32:40.558 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:32:42.390 --> 05:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh wording we looked at multiple
 
05:32:44.830 --> 05:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
amendments from individuals on our
 
05:32:46.868 --> 05:32:46.878 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
05:32:50.948 --> 05:32:50.958 align:start position:0%
at the very end we actually i put in a
 
05:32:52.868 --> 05:32:52.878 align:start position:0%
an amendment that brought it back to the
 
05:32:56.070 --> 05:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
senate's original uh version
 
05:32:58.868 --> 05:32:58.878 align:start position:0%
that final amendment attempt i should
 
05:33:02.868 --> 05:33:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:04.628 --> 05:33:04.638 align:start position:0%
that was followed by the motion for
 
05:33:06.310 --> 05:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
05:33:08.948 --> 05:33:08.958 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that this issue has been
 
05:33:10.868 --> 05:33:10.878 align:start position:0%
in our committee now on and off for a
 
05:33:12.390 --> 05:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
very long time
 
05:33:14.708 --> 05:33:14.718 align:start position:0%
i can tell you um
 
05:33:18.070 --> 05:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
that section of employment law
 
05:33:20.708 --> 05:33:20.718 align:start position:0%
is what i would consider
 
05:33:20.718 --> 05:33:22.150 align:start position:0%
is what i would consider
excessive

05:33:22.150 --> 05:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
excessive
 
05:33:25.910 --> 05:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
right now it sits at 695 words on just
 
05:33:27.670 --> 05:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
how an employer
 
05:33:29.830 --> 05:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
will pay their
 
05:33:31.350 --> 05:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
employee not
 
05:33:33.990 --> 05:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
when or on how many frequent occasions
 
05:33:35.590 --> 05:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
that used to be
 
05:33:37.830 --> 05:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh every week
 
05:33:38.948 --> 05:33:38.958 align:start position:0%
unless you got
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
special dispensation from the the
 
05:33:41.040 --> 05:33:42.548 align:start position:0%
special dispensation from the the
commission

05:33:42.548 --> 05:33:42.558 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:33:45.510 --> 05:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
i actually put in a an amendment on that
 
05:33:47.110 --> 05:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
to change it to every two weeks because
 
05:33:49.270 --> 05:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
so many of our employee
 
05:33:52.230 --> 05:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
businesses wanted a a different time
 
05:33:55.270 --> 05:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:58.070 --> 05:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to suggest here is that
 
05:34:00.628 --> 05:34:00.638 align:start position:0%
like so many things we do
 
05:34:01.750 --> 05:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
we take
 
05:34:01.760 --> 05:34:02.708 align:start position:0%
we take
what

05:34:02.708 --> 05:34:02.718 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:34:05.110 --> 05:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
some would consider horrible language
 
05:34:07.510 --> 05:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
and continue to make it worse and more
 
05:34:07.520 --> 05:34:09.190 align:start position:0%
and continue to make it worse and more
burdensome

05:34:09.190 --> 05:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
burdensome
 
05:34:11.430 --> 05:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
on our businesses in the labor committee
 
05:34:14.310 --> 05:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
our goal is to reduce regulations reduce
 
05:34:14.320 --> 05:34:15.990 align:start position:0%
our goal is to reduce regulations reduce
burdens

05:34:15.990 --> 05:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
burdens
 
05:34:18.310 --> 05:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
and make everything simplif
 
05:34:21.750 --> 05:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
simplify everything for our businesses
 
05:34:23.190 --> 05:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
i'm going to give you a couple examples
 
05:34:25.350 --> 05:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
of why this is actually
 
05:34:28.150 --> 05:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
worse than what we already have
 
05:34:28.160 --> 05:34:31.830 align:start position:0%
worse than what we already have
but

05:34:31.830 --> 05:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:34.310 --> 05:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of our last hearing almost
 
05:34:35.990 --> 05:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
half jokingly
 
05:34:38.470 --> 05:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
i said you know what what we need in in
 
05:34:41.110 --> 05:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
this section instead of 695 words we
 
05:34:43.350 --> 05:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
need a sentence that says this
 
05:34:45.270 --> 05:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
upon initial employment the employer
 
05:34:47.670 --> 05:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
shall inform the employee the method
 
05:34:49.990 --> 05:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
method of payment for wages earned by
 
05:34:50.000 --> 05:34:50.830 align:start position:0%
method of payment for wages earned by
the

05:34:50.830 --> 05:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:34:54.470 --> 05:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
employee what a concept simplify
 
05:34:54.480 --> 05:34:55.990 align:start position:0%
employee what a concept simplify
eliminate

05:34:55.990 --> 05:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
05:34:59.590 --> 05:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
three or four paragraphs now i granted
 
05:35:01.430 --> 05:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
we there need to be a few other little
 
05:35:04.548 --> 05:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
minor changes in there but this
 
05:35:07.670 --> 05:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
is just uh
 
05:35:10.230 --> 05:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
too excessive it makes it more difficult
 
05:35:11.910 --> 05:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
to understand and like i say we went
 
05:35:13.670 --> 05:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
through this on our committee for two
 
05:35:16.390 --> 05:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
weeks going back and forth
 
05:35:18.788 --> 05:35:18.798 align:start position:0%
we spent an inordinate amount of time on
 
05:35:20.230 --> 05:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
this and in the end we sent it to
 
05:35:21.910 --> 05:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
interim study because we believe that's
 
05:35:23.110 --> 05:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
where it should go
 
05:35:25.590 --> 05:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
i mean a couple of the the issues that
 
05:35:28.390 --> 05:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
some of us saw especially
 
05:35:30.788 --> 05:35:30.798 align:start position:0%
on the very first page of
 
05:35:34.230 --> 05:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
fort page 14 there in the middle
 
05:35:36.708 --> 05:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
it talks about uh an employer shall be
 
05:35:39.750 --> 05:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
liable for late payment of wages really
 
05:35:42.868 --> 05:35:42.878 align:start position:0%
uh and this this was my favorite
 
05:35:44.788 --> 05:35:44.798 align:start position:0%
should an employee's payroll card be
 
05:35:47.110 --> 05:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
lost stolen or damaged let's stick with
 
05:35:49.750 --> 05:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
loss and the funds are no it's no longer
 
05:35:51.990 --> 05:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
accessible to the employee
 
05:35:54.070 --> 05:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
the employer shall be required to
 
05:35:56.150 --> 05:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
provide the employee with a replacement
 
05:35:58.628 --> 05:35:58.638 align:start position:0%
card within 24 hours all right so on
 
05:36:00.310 --> 05:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
friday night i'm out at
 
05:36:02.150 --> 05:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
my favorite pub and then i happen to
 
05:36:04.230 --> 05:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
lose my payroll card
 
05:36:06.070 --> 05:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
i call up saturday morning to my
 
05:36:06.080 --> 05:36:07.110 align:start position:0%
i call up saturday morning to my
business

05:36:07.110 --> 05:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
business
 
05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
who's closed and say hey i need a
 
05:36:12.310 --> 05:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
replacement card in 24 hours
 
05:36:12.320 --> 05:36:13.110 align:start position:0%
replacement card in 24 hours
so

05:36:13.110 --> 05:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:36:15.830 --> 05:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to suggest is we again
 
05:36:18.310 --> 05:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
labor committee after much much work
 
05:36:20.470 --> 05:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
said interim study
 
05:36:22.708 --> 05:36:22.718 align:start position:0%
i'm going to suggest we stick with that
 
05:36:25.110 --> 05:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
and what i will
 
05:36:27.270 --> 05:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
offer to the senate
 
05:36:29.110 --> 05:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
is this fall
 
05:36:31.590 --> 05:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
if i am reminded of it
 
05:36:33.030 --> 05:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
i will put in
 
05:36:35.590 --> 05:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
a bill that actually does
 
05:36:36.868 --> 05:36:36.878 align:start position:0%
attempt to
 
05:36:41.110 --> 05:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
bring 695 words down to maybe 50.
 
05:36:42.948 --> 05:36:42.958 align:start position:0%
because that's where we should be going
 
05:36:44.708 --> 05:36:44.718 align:start position:0%
we should make it be making it easier
 
05:36:46.390 --> 05:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
for our businesses
 
05:36:48.070 --> 05:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
not increasing
 
05:36:50.150 --> 05:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
the burden on our businesses thank you
 
05:36:55.350 --> 05:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:55.360 --> 05:36:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
anything

05:36:57.590 --> 05:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
anything
 
05:37:00.310 --> 05:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
um i don't know i think i remember the
 
05:37:03.030 --> 05:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
seed about the local bank
 
05:37:05.190 --> 05:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
that that made it came across our
 
05:37:07.750 --> 05:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
committee but uh evidently uh this
 
05:37:11.030 --> 05:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
debate of paychecks has been an ongoing
 
05:37:13.350 --> 05:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
struggle for years and years and years
 
05:37:13.360 --> 05:37:14.868 align:start position:0%
struggle for years and years and years
and

05:37:14.868 --> 05:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:37:14.878 --> 05:37:16.628 align:start position:0%
and
and

05:37:16.628 --> 05:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:37:18.150 --> 05:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the right answer is
 
05:37:21.110 --> 05:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
and i i always seems much more
 
05:37:22.948 --> 05:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
complicated but i the idea of an
 
05:37:25.350 --> 05:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
employer having to replace something a
 
05:37:25.360 --> 05:37:26.628 align:start position:0%
employer having to replace something a
card

05:37:26.628 --> 05:37:26.638 align:start position:0%
card
 
05:37:29.350 --> 05:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
in a 24-hour period so if the pay if the
 
05:37:31.270 --> 05:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
card is lost on a saturday how's the
 
05:37:33.590 --> 05:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
employer supposed to get that card
 
05:37:34.708 --> 05:37:34.718 align:start position:0%
to them and
 
05:37:36.868 --> 05:37:36.878 align:start position:0%
i don't know that seems problematic to
 
05:37:39.910 --> 05:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
me two sentences above that seem worse
 
05:37:42.070 --> 05:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
should an employee be unable to access
 
05:37:43.910 --> 05:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
their wages due to a technical or
 
05:37:46.788 --> 05:37:46.798 align:start position:0%
processing defect the employer shall
 
05:37:46.798 --> 05:37:48.070 align:start position:0%
processing defect the employer shall
immediately

05:37:48.070 --> 05:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
05:37:50.390 --> 05:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
provide the wages to the employee with a
 
05:37:53.510 --> 05:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
replacement payroll card etc right
 
05:37:55.030 --> 05:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
how do you how does how do you how do
 
05:37:57.670 --> 05:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
you make that happen i mean it should be
 
05:38:00.708 --> 05:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
quickly but immediately
 
05:38:02.470 --> 05:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
yes just one more point i forgot to
 
05:38:04.470 --> 05:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
mention and
 
05:38:06.230 --> 05:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
this isn't the first place i've seen
 
05:38:09.990 --> 05:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:11.670 --> 05:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
bill or committee conference coming up
 
05:38:13.750 --> 05:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow i believe where it's a similar
 
05:38:16.470 --> 05:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
situation and we see it a lot in labor
 
05:38:19.670 --> 05:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
we attempt to fix
 
05:38:19.680 --> 05:38:20.830 align:start position:0%
we attempt to fix
a

05:38:20.830 --> 05:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:38:23.590 --> 05:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
problem that
 
05:38:27.190 --> 05:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
only affects a minute portion of our
 
05:38:30.948 --> 05:38:30.958 align:start position:0%
population we put in 695 words i'm just
 
05:38:33.990 --> 05:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
using this as an example to fix the one
 
05:38:35.910 --> 05:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
or one half of one percent of
 
05:38:35.920 --> 05:38:37.510 align:start position:0%
or one half of one percent of
individuals

05:38:37.510 --> 05:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
05:38:37.520 --> 05:38:38.708 align:start position:0%
individuals
who

05:38:38.708 --> 05:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:38:38.718 --> 05:38:39.910 align:start position:0%
who
um

05:38:39.910 --> 05:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:42.310 --> 05:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
for some reason or another so and when
 
05:38:44.310 --> 05:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
we do that
 
05:38:46.070 --> 05:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
you create all these burdens and
 
05:38:48.390 --> 05:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
expenses on businesses for that one
 
05:38:51.270 --> 05:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
individual like i say i i really truly
 
05:38:54.390 --> 05:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
believe for everybody's benefit that the
 
05:38:56.150 --> 05:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
business should have the ability when
 
05:38:58.230 --> 05:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
they hire an employee to say
 
05:38:59.990 --> 05:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
this is how i'm going to pay you we
 
05:39:02.628 --> 05:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
could even eliminate another 400 words
 
05:39:04.230 --> 05:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
and say and this is you're going to be
 
05:39:06.150 --> 05:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
your pay period
 
05:39:07.990 --> 05:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
would you say then that
 
05:39:09.910 --> 05:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
let's say i'm looking for work even
 
05:39:11.830 --> 05:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
though i have three full-time jobs now
 
05:39:13.750 --> 05:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
but let's say i wanted another one
 
05:39:16.788 --> 05:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
and i went over to abc widgets which you
 
05:39:20.230 --> 05:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
won't and you said welcome so glad
 
05:39:22.390 --> 05:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
you're considering coming to work here
 
05:39:24.708 --> 05:39:24.718 align:start position:0%
this is how we pay you
 
05:39:27.830 --> 05:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
you get a payroll check every other week
 
05:39:30.628 --> 05:39:30.638 align:start position:0%
and i say i don't want that
 
05:39:32.708 --> 05:39:32.718 align:start position:0%
and you say there's a lot of other
 
05:39:34.948 --> 05:39:34.958 align:start position:0%
people that are hiring out there and i
 
05:39:38.070 --> 05:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
go find working for xyz widgets that's
 
05:39:40.390 --> 05:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
willing to do something differently the
 
05:39:43.590 --> 05:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
employee the employer has the right
 
05:39:46.310 --> 05:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
to broaden it or narrow it depending on
 
05:39:49.430 --> 05:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
the employer's choices and i have the
 
05:39:51.670 --> 05:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
right to accept or reject accordingly is
 
05:39:54.150 --> 05:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying
 
05:39:56.628 --> 05:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
in a shorter version of that yes mr
 
05:39:56.638 --> 05:39:57.750 align:start position:0%
in a shorter version of that yes mr
chairman

05:39:57.750 --> 05:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:39:59.670 --> 05:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
but that's exactly the point and again
 
05:40:01.670 --> 05:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
this is something we emphasize on the
 
05:40:03.910 --> 05:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
labor committee all the time
 
05:40:07.190 --> 05:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
the decision on
 
05:40:09.030 --> 05:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
things that go on within a business
 
05:40:11.910 --> 05:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
should be between the employer
 
05:40:14.070 --> 05:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
and the employee or the business and the
 
05:40:16.470 --> 05:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
employee it shouldn't be
 
05:40:18.628 --> 05:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
politicians or bureaucrats saying you
 
05:40:20.310 --> 05:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
have to do this you have to do this you
 
05:40:21.750 --> 05:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
have to do this
 
05:40:24.310 --> 05:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
simplify it help our businesses
 
05:40:24.320 --> 05:40:25.350 align:start position:0%
simplify it help our businesses
operate

05:40:25.350 --> 05:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
operate
 
05:40:27.270 --> 05:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
so in your scenario that's exactly what
 
05:40:32.150 --> 05:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:34.070 --> 05:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
well since i see nothing further let's
 
05:40:36.628 --> 05:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
do a vote by orders to see whether we
 
05:40:40.230 --> 05:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:41.590 --> 05:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman we're not voting
 
05:40:44.230 --> 05:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
individually on each particular session
 
05:40:46.470 --> 05:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
section we will take one vote on the
 
05:40:48.390 --> 05:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
bill at the end of
 
05:40:50.150 --> 05:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
every discussion at the end of the
 
05:40:52.788 --> 05:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
discussion that is how we do it that is
 
05:40:55.990 --> 05:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
how who does it that is how we do that's
 
05:40:57.750 --> 05:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
how your senate the senate wishes to do
 
05:40:59.910 --> 05:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
this yes we will take one vote on the
 
05:41:01.350 --> 05:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
bill as a whole
 
05:41:04.150 --> 05:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
after every after okay that's not how
 
05:41:05.750 --> 05:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
i've been rolling
 
05:41:08.070 --> 05:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
thus far but since you've given an
 
05:41:10.708 --> 05:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
ultimatum i have no choice
 
05:41:12.470 --> 05:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative hunt
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
um i i think they should take this on
 
05:41:15.270 --> 05:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
with him
 
05:41:16.948 --> 05:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
05:41:16.958 --> 05:41:18.788 align:start position:0%
okay and
representative

05:41:18.788 --> 05:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:41:20.470 --> 05:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
i think we should take this out we are
 
05:41:23.590 --> 05:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
voting our way and that is on each item
 
05:41:25.350 --> 05:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
and you're saying
 
05:41:27.350 --> 05:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
yes or no to this i'm saying this should
 
05:41:29.590 --> 05:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
be out i think i've made uh very good
 
05:41:32.070 --> 05:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
arguments as to a much better option and
 
05:41:33.750 --> 05:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:41:36.948 --> 05:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
sorry that is what the house has done
 
05:41:38.390 --> 05:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
senate will
 
05:41:40.628 --> 05:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
respond accordingly item number four
 
05:41:42.788 --> 05:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
requires third-party sellers to provide
 
05:41:44.310 --> 05:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
certain information to online
 
05:41:46.788 --> 05:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
marketplaces and to consumers
 
05:41:49.270 --> 05:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
and deems the failure to do so a
 
05:41:51.910 --> 05:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
violation of the consumer protection act
 
05:41:53.990 --> 05:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
we had a spirited decision while the
 
05:41:57.030 --> 05:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
senate was caucusing about this and i'm
 
05:41:58.788 --> 05:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
quite in favor of it
 
05:42:00.548 --> 05:42:00.558 align:start position:0%
um but
 
05:42:02.548 --> 05:42:02.558 align:start position:0%
we could cut to the chase because we've
 
05:42:05.270 --> 05:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
all heard the arguments and i would like
 
05:42:08.230 --> 05:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
to pull my delegation to see what you're
 
05:42:09.670 --> 05:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
going to say
 
05:42:12.230 --> 05:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
and uh this is on item number four
 
05:42:14.390 --> 05:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative edwards third-party
 
05:42:16.390 --> 05:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
seller's information
 
05:42:19.110 --> 05:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
and i think we've discussed it to death
 
05:42:21.190 --> 05:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative hunt how would you
 
05:42:23.030 --> 05:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
vote i would like to remove from the
 
05:42:25.750 --> 05:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
bill and representative turcotte removed
 
05:42:27.750 --> 05:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
please okay well that's it then because
 
05:42:29.350 --> 05:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
we have more than one
 
05:42:32.070 --> 05:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
so now we are done and now we can vote
 
05:42:35.510 --> 05:42:35.520 align:start position:0%

05:42:56.628 --> 05:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
