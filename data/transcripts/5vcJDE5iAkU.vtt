thank

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 align:start position:0%
you good morning everybody Welcome to
 
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
Edna I'm opening the public hearing on
 
00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill for 1413 and I call
 
00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:26.350 align:start position:0%
House Bill for 1413 and I call
Representative

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
Greg good morning Madam chairwoman and
 
00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 align:start position:0%
committee it's nice to see you all today
 
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
um for the record I'm representative
 
00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
Alicia Greg I represent nashille award 7
 
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today to talk about um bill
 
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
for House Bill
 
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
1413 and this is a bill that in kind of
 
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
looking at wording and how we're
 
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
licensing and stuff um with our
 
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
different sections uh we came across
 
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
this particular section that has some
 
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
outdated language but not only that it's
 
00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
duplicative and so I'm going to let um
 
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
OPC is here I'm going to let them
 
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
explain why it's duplicative even more
 
00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 align:start position:0%
but what this does is just kind of
 
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
cleans this up so it's less confusing as
 
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
we go about our licensing process um and
 
00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 align:start position:0%
that's I think that she would be better
 
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
qualified to explain that more all right
 
00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
Courtney thank you madam chair um
 
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Lindsay
 
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
Courtney executive director oplc and
 
00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 align:start position:0%
wish to thank representative Greg for
 
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward so essentially
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it would repeal
 
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
the current provision in the statute
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
that um provides for I'm going to give
 
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
you the exact term um
 
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice under supervision
 
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
agreement um so that's 3:30 a22 so as
 
00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
you may recall several years ago this
 
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
legislative body um establish license
 
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
types additional license types under the
 
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
board of mental health practice several
 
00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
of those license types are called the
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
conditional lure and the testimony that
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
we heard was essentially that we needed
 
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
to establish lure in order to provide an
 
00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
easier pathway for reimbursement so as
 
00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
it stands we currently have two Pathways
 
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
for these people we have the unlicensed
 
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
um um person who is operating under an
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
approved supervision agreement under
 
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
330a colon 22 and then you have folks
 
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
that are licensed operating under
 
00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 align:start position:0%
supervision agreement but are subject to
 
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction of the board and this
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
um this dichotomy presents um some
 
00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
challenges I think administratively to
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
the office but also I think what we've
 
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
observed is the challenge with respect
 
00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
to the unlicensed part is that the board
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't have excuse me they don't have
 
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the individuals who
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
are actually practicing under
 
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
supervision so if there is an issue um
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
and we've had this happen where the
 
00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
person being supervised uh commits
 
00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 align:start position:0%
misconduct the board doesn't have that
 
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and cannot discipline and
 
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise notify the license the public
 
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
that there could be a a problem um
 
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
actually the burden is on the leny
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
providing the supervision whereas under
 
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
the other model the uh the person who is
 
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
licensed has a conditional license is
 
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
subject to the jurisdiction of the board
 
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
so essentially this bill would repeal
 
00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
that second pathway um and provide for
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
one pathway uh to obtain your
 
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
LCSW um which is uh a conditional
 
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
license for a certain period of time
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
under supervision that's approved by the
 
00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
board happy to answer any
 
00:06:58.589 --> 00:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I have a question
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
how many people have conditional
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
licenses versus are practicing without
 
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
licenses or don't you know the latter
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
number so I don't know the total number
 
00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
of people who have approved supervision
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
agreements yes um I think you may recall
 
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
that the rules establishing the
 
00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
conditional licenses were the rules that
 
00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
issue um that that the governor and
 
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
others brought forward um at an
 
00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:23.479 align:start position:0%
executive council meeting and jail car
 
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
considered those rules in December
 
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 align:start position:0%
postpone them and they will be heard by
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
jail car I think on Friday
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
we've resolved um the stakeholder
 
00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
concerns so I I have every reason to
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
think that they will move move forward
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
but we we haven't actually issued
 
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.950 align:start position:0%
but we we haven't actually issued
conditional

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
conditional
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
licenses um I suspect that by the time
 
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
if this legislation were to pass uh a
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
lot of people who currently have
 
00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
approved supervis supervision agreements
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
would seek conditional licenses because
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
again it provides that benefit of
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
allowing for reimbursement
 
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities so how many people have
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
approved supervisory agreements that I
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
would have to get back to you on
 
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative thank you it would be it
 
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
would be good to know does anyone okay
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative grota and then
 
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
laus thank you um Miss
 
00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
Courtney I just want to make sure that I
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
understand this I'm sorry did you say
 
00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
representative leus after you okay thank
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
you um so are we saying then there will
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
not be a path for unlicensed people
 
00:08:27.869 --> 00:08:27.879 align:start position:0%
requiring supervision is that what we're
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:40.039 align:start position:0%
correct okay represent leus thank you um
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
so right now are there any requirements
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
for someone for any anything for the
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
person who is going to work under the
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
supervis visory agreement and um if so
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
how do those compare to the requirements
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
for someone to get a conditional license
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out if if there's
 
00:08:58.509 --> 00:08:58.519 align:start position:0%
somebody who's currently working under
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
the uh such you know supervisory
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
agreement uh who could not um apply at
 
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
least you know without doing something
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
further for conditional license I think
 
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
there are members of the board here and
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
I would defer to them on the specifics
 
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
but I think the intent when adopting or
 
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
or I'm sorry um working on the rules to
 
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
adop the rules adopting the conditional
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
lure that the intent was to keep the
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
requirements the
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
same okay thank
 
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.870 align:start position:0%
same okay thank
you

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative Schmidt and then uh
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair so I I heard
 
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
your earlier answer to representative
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
Le's question the chair's question about
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
the numbers so even if you don't have
 
00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:45.079 align:start position:0%
the exact number at the moment and
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
you're going to get get it for us you
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
have some idea whether it's a lot or
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
very few or what if you have any
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
idea I don't want to I don't want to
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
guess representative so I can certainly
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
email the committee that that number by
 
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
the end of the day today that would be
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
great thank you all right represent
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:10:09.069 --> 00:10:09.079 align:start position:0%
you director for taking my question um
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned that uh one of the
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
problems with the supervisory agreement
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
is that there's no direct oversight of
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
the board uh is that correct yes however
 
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
looking at the statute they do have
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
direct supervision over the
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
licensed um practitioner who's
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
overseeing um the supervised cand
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
correct correct so I'm just I just want
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand correctly as
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
all so don't they technically have
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
supervision over that person through the
 
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.110 align:start position:0%
supervision over that person through the
licensed

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
individual yes well so they do have
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the ly providing
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
supervision the issue is that sometimes
 
00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:49.959 align:start position:0%
instances of misconduct are not due to a
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
lack of supervision or appropriate
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
supervision and so you can't always take
 
00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:55.959 align:start position:0%
action against the leny providing
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
supervision and then you're left with no
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
mechanism to notify the public that
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
there was this finding of this this
 
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
issue of concern thank you for that
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
clarification appreciate it other
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
for your
 
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:27.800 align:start position:0%

counseling to over 1,000 individuals in
 
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire and about 30% of

those um individuals are Medicaid uh or
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
Medicare patients uh we're about a two
 
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
plus million dollar company or so um I'm
 
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
here to speak to you about um this
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
supervision contract which is uh wholly
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
unfair to the private um uh sector of
 
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
mental health counseling and I'm glad to
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
see that this legislation was brought
 
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
forth to eliminate it some of you may
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
not know but these supervision
 
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
agreements do not apply to um the mental
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
health centers or nonprofits or
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
institutions they're exempt from having
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
a supervision contract uh this only
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
applies to the for-profit industry uh if
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
there is a person who has a master's
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
degree in social work who wants to
 
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
practice Psychotherapy at greater
 
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
natural mental health care they can
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
start on day one if they graduate um
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
from Graduate School uh if I want them
 
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
to work for me I have to get approval
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
from the board through a supervision
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
contract because otherwise they're not
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
permitted to conduct Psychotherapy in
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that is one
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
of the reasons I'm here to ask that you
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh eliminate this and as the board has
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
already saw a fit uh create the
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
conditional lenses of um
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
lcswc lcmhc CC so that person who's
 
00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
applying exact same requirements um if
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
you're following the rules of the board
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
of mental health that someone would have
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
for the um supervision agreement is
 
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
already in place that they would just
 
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
whoever has it now my understanding from
 
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
reading the rules as proposed and I
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
believe they're going to be similar as
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
there's someone else from the board here
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
that can uh State um more detailed facts
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
that those folks would just migrate to
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
the conditional lure and not have an
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
interruption of the service that they're
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
providing to their um
 
00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:31.959 align:start position:0%
their clients one major issue with the
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
supervision contracts as they stand my I
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
have about 35 employees maybe half of
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
which are under supervision agreements
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
and half are licensed I have licens
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
providers who are in their 80s if that
 
00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:51.759 align:start position:0%
person suddenly becomes ill or dies the
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
person that they're supervising cannot
 
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
see their hundreds of patients I'm I'm
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
going to say four clinicians because
 
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
that's I think the board caps at four
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
supervises per per lense e we have to
 
00:14:04.749 --> 00:14:04.759 align:start position:0%
stop providing treatment because they
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
are no longer under a supervision
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
agreement because that person's uh
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
incapacitated their supervisor that does
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
not apply someone at the mental health
 
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
center someone at uh uh Harbor care or
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
another nonprofit institution and that's
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
uh in one of the rsas of 330 um so I'm
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
here to you to ask that you repeal this
 
00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
language because it's whol unfair to
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
small businesses that are providing
 
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:31.240 align:start position:0%
Healthcare and quite frankly now that
 
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
private insurances are allowing uh
 
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
pre-licensed professionals uh to Bill
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
through their licensed super supervisor
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
uh it is very uncompetitive and I cannot
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
see anywhere in the state of New
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to have a business be
 
00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%
uncompetitive with a nonprofit it it is
 
00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:50.759 align:start position:0%
blows my mind and I'm a Democrat uh very
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
funny story my colleague from um uh Ward
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
one he's a alderman with me Tyler Goa
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
Republican he's down stairs uh
 
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
advocating for the firefighters and I'm
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
up here fighting for capitalism very big
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
day today um but I'm I'm saying that
 
00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
these contracts are not fair to the
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
private uh mental health industry
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
there's a mechanism coming forth to
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
allow conditional licensers uh that
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
gives board oversight of someone who's
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
not fully licensed and it eliminates
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
this competitive advantage that
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
nonprofits have against the Private
 
00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:25.759 align:start position:0%
Industry who in my opinion provide
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
better care and I'm doing with my money
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
not state
 
00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
money okay well thank you I'm glad
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of
 
00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
capitalism is there anyone that has
 
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
representative Manti thank you madam
 
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
chair so if I um understand you
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
correctly this is
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
creating currently what we have in the
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
system is two tier for mental health
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
providers am I correct yeah there's a a
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
tier for nonprofits and a tier for for
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh the Private Industry nonprofits folks
 
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
they can still get um a contract they
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
don't need it I worked in nonprofits
 
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
before this I can tell you many people
 
00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
did not get it they go to try to get
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
their license and they oh I've been
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
supervised for two years oh there's no
 
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
board contract on file you can't but why
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
was I practicing for two years because
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
that your company's exempt so there's
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
also a lot of confusion around how
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
someone can get licensed uh because of
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
this contract that exists the way it is
 
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.670 align:start position:0%
this contract that exists the way it is
follow

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so how does this help or
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
enhance the acute shortage we have for
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
mental health providers in the state and
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh how does this
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
allow to get more people to get into
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
medical I mean mental
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
health that's an excellent question uh
 
00:16:56.309 --> 00:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
if this was eliminated the day after
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
someone has conferred a graduate degree
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
that meets the qualification ations uh
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the board to render Psychotherapy
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
while being supervised they could do
 
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
that uh day one instead of waiting up to
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
I think it's 120 days which one of I
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
when I first opened my business um in
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
NASA in 2020 my second office I had to
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
wait 120 days for the board of mental
 
00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:20.039 align:start position:0%
health to approve a contract before one
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
of my employees could start to work for
 
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
me doesn't make sense so people will be
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
okay represent Blas um this is for you
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
is somebody from the board signed up to
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
speak or if not um if they could answer
 
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.230 align:start position:0%
speak or if not um if they could answer
some

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
questions is there somebody from the
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
board of mental health practice here yes
 
00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:48.919 align:start position:0%
uh we'll we'll we'll talk we'll ask you
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
to put in a card and we have some
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions for you the board of mental
 
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
health has not had a chance to meet uh
 
00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
and vote to authorize anyone to speak
 
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
they wanted to be here for this they
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
cared deeply and
 
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
passionately the board thank you I would
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
I understand that you'd haven't taken a
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
vote and you don't have a formal support
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
or opposed position but you should be
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
able to give us some information I hope
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
I can I can try okay thank you please we
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
would love to have
 
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
that okay any other
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
Castrucci hi my name is Diane
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
Castrucci I am a licensed substance use
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
counselor and I'm here representing
 
00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
myself because I'm not currently
 
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
licensed by the board that this vote is
 
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
about um however I am opposed to it
 
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
based on what clinical supervision is
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to be about so
 
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
um RSA 330
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
CA talks about the type of supervision
 
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
and that it needs to be convenient
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
between the person who's supervised and
 
00:19:11.549 --> 00:19:11.559 align:start position:0%
the person who is providing the
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
supervision and the types of protections
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
supervision the way it's written it's
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
100% aligned with the LC board it is um
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
important for there to be a supervisor
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
in place when someone is a candidate
 
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
towards a credential because the
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
supervision that is provided is about
 
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
helping that person learn how to do what
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do it helps protect
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
the public by
 
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
um guiding them in appropriate ways of
 
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
delivering Services it helps them deal
 
00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
with issues so that like if I'm the
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
counselor and I'm brand new and I'm just
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
just trying to learn I don't try to
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
treat them like my dad you know because
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
my dad needed Services kind of situation
 
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
it helps them separate their own
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
personal stuff out of the services that
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
they're trying to provide to their
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
client um just as one example of of a
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
very small amount of what clinical
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
supervision does it clinical supervision
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
also helps them um with on the job
 
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
training about how to be a proper Su uh
 
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
counselor and without that clinical
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
supervision there's just regular
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
administrative supervision from an
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
agency and the clinical super because of
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
clinical supervision being set up you're
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
able to talk about confidential
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
information specifically about a client
 
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
in a different way than you would with a
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
supervisor that is the end of my
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you could you answer a
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
question or two I can try Okay um I
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
understand that you're testifying that
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
the conditions set up for supervision
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
here are correct is it I agree with them
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
yes I like how they're set up I like
 
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.510 align:start position:0%
yes I like how they're set up I like
section

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
330a and how it describes clinical
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
supervision I believe you don't you
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't take away something that's not
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
broken okay I the question is are you in
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
support of allowing UNL licens people to
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
enter into these
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
agreements because that's that's what
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
and I don't see that piece in the
 
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.110 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative so in the um legislation
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
it repeals all of RSA -
 
00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:04.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
there a a part of the RSA that we could
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
keep and eliminate some I'm wondering if
 
00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
there's just perhaps
 
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
a part of RSA 22 that doesn't
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
apply well the I'm trying to because it
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
repeats the whole I'm looking it up as
 
00:22:26.909 --> 00:22:26.919 align:start position:0%
we speak and I looked at this I I agree
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh president br I think the D what we
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
would want to do is instead of saying a
 
00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
candidate for license mental health
 
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
licenser say person with a conditional
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
license would be the way to do
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
it I just Madam chair do we not do we
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
not we don't know how I thought there
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
were no conditional licenses issued at
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
this time no but they're set up in
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
statute ah and the rules are are almost
 
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.110 align:start position:0%
statute ah and the rules are are almost
done

00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.190 align:start position:0%
done
mhm

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
so that's the question is do you are you
 
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
in support of unlicensed people being
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
supervised or just people who would be
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
license I believe anyone unlicensed
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
in the lak world once someone has um
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
their credential if it is a bachelor's
 
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
level or below they still need
 
00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
supervision whereas someone who is
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
Master's level or
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
greater can work with peer collaboration
 
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
with their peers but there is still some
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
mechanism that exists that has them
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
communicating with each other about
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
proper care of
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
clients thank you very much I think
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
followup followup thank you so um I
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
understand what part of 322a so the part
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
of 322a that says that supervision of a
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
candidate for mental health lure shall
 
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
include the following so basically it it
 
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
defines what that relationship is
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
between the like the person doing the
 
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
supervision and the person being
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
supervised and perhaps
 
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
we may want to take a look at that
 
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
because it actually formalizes that
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
relationship and it makes it
 
00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:38.590 align:start position:0%
relationship and it makes it
rather

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
rather
 
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
strict and so maybe it's can be it for
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
example right they have to assume the
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the candidate which
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
you understand right and then if they
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
are if they cease to supervise that
 
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
person they need to be notified in
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
writing I'm just wondering if some of
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
this should be done in rules as opposed
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
to in statute so if we does this make
 
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
sense where where I'm heading I don't
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
know if well I think we're it's not as
 
00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:08.919 align:start position:0%
quick and easy as we thought okay well
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
definitely not as quick and easy as we
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
thought exactly okay but thank you for
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
that information it's for sure valuable
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank and uh ma'am from
 
00:25:21.559 --> 00:25:26.669 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank and uh ma'am from
the

00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
board

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
right now uh provisional license he has
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
the supervision set
 
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
up correct you're talking about the
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
conditional license conditional sorry
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay certainly uh it goes in tandem with
 
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start position:0%
the conditional license and uh sorry I'm
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
not able to see you but I am still
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
talking to you um and requires that um
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
that the supervisor be properly vetted
 
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
for supervision as well as uh the
 
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
candidate having their um goals in place
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
for what they are hoping to get out of
 
00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
supervision um and then the board can
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that those lineup um with uh
 
00:26:23.389 --> 00:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
their their licenser uh license type and
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
um and that they meet the high standard
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
um these these folks are going to be
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
diagnosing individuals and so this this
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
level of supervision is incredibly
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
important follow up Madam chair um I'm
 
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
aware of clinical Fellowship year in
 
00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
speech language pathology and Audiology
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
so as soon as you graduate you have to
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
do nine months or a year of clinical
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
Fellowship year to get your license to
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
practice independently is is provisional
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
license similar to that in mental
 
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
health it sounds analogus to me yes um
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
it it's a it's a two-year requirement
 
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.990 align:start position:0%
it it's a it's a two-year requirement
however

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
um rather than than nine months but yes
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
to prepare them for diagnosing and other
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
such okay thank you other question Madam
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
chair is this going to go to
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I believe it it should yes
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative lacus thank
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
you so I'm looking at um the statute
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
that this would repeal about the
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
supervision um it says the supervision
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
of a candidate for mental health
 
00:27:48.029 --> 00:27:48.039 align:start position:0%
licensure my question is what are the
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
requirements to be a candidate for
 
00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
mental health licensure I was just
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
glancing at that and I don't see any it
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
means it elsewhere in statute maybe or
 
00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
rules or
 
00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um I
 
00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
am looking at the definitions
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
and uh in the statute there is not a
 
00:28:09.149 --> 00:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
definition for candidate for mental
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
health licenser I had that same question
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
with the board when I first joined them
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
um I would recommend that they Define it
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
and maybe they have in Rule and I could
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
look that up for you um follow up follow
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
up yes um okay so I guess this is going
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
to the licensing subcommittee if you
 
00:28:27.149 --> 00:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
could be available or someone else who
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
could answer these questions could be
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
available um what I'm trying to get at
 
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
um is you know what what does it take to
 
00:28:37.389 --> 00:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
be a candidate for mental health
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
licensure and how does that compare to
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
someone who is eligible to apply for a
 
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
conditional license I'm trying to see if
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
in effect this is a direct replacement
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
except for the board having Authority
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
and not having to uh have a u u
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
supervisory agreement or will there be a
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
supervisory agreement for uh cial
 
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
license those are the kind of of
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
questions I hope you someone can answer
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
for the subcommittee sure well well the
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
first thing is that um the candidate for
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
mental health licensure is for one
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
license type for the licensed clinical
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
mental health counselor whereas the
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
conditional license is for all of the
 
00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:14.519 align:start position:0%
license types uh it's not just for
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Counselors but for S
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
licens to practice independently but
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
they are working towards license
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
insurance so they must have supervision
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
when they're not properly licensed thank
 
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair okay Madam
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
chair I see the prime sponsor trying
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
yeah eager to get back and clarify
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
something yes thank you uh thank you and
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you'll have your support for
 
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.029 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you'll have your support for
the

00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative Greg you
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
us thank you madam chairman uh
 
00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
chairwoman and committee I should have
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
had more faith in myself on my first
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
bill to explain this a little bit better
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
and now I uh learning curves so thank
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
you you for um giving me this
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity once again I'm
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
representative Alicia Greg I represent
 
00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:04.519 align:start position:0%
Nashville award 7 so in looking at this
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
my initial conversation was actually
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
around the language um which specifies
 
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
and legal so it it talks about how the
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
supervisor must be um both
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
professionally and legally responsible
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
for their candidate which is interesting
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
if you say in legally responsible within
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
the workplace this particular language
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
just says and legally responsible
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
I mean it's hard enough if you have an
 
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
over 18-year-old in your house to stay
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
legally responsible for that person so
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
you think about this and how this
 
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
complicates somebody wanting to be a
 
00:30:40.269 --> 00:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
supervisor knowing this so in looking at
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
this statute statute this was actually
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
pretty common language back in the early
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
1980s um when they had this as far as
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
social work goes they have this an legal
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
was in there if you look at the history
 
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
of this it slowly Fades off uh other
 
00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:58.519 align:start position:0%
other statutes have replaced those
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
particular lens or statutes this one
 
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:04.519 align:start position:0%
stayed so when I when I called oplc and
 
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
said you know would you be in favor of
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
taking off in legal because we seem they
 
00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:10.519 align:start position:0%
actually said it was duplicative and
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
that was the biggest problem now what is
 
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
it duplicative of um and they stated
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
that it was duplicate duplicative of
 
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.269 align:start position:0%
that it was duplicate duplicative of
330a

00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
330a
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
18d so at that point I looked at that
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
and I said well that's social work so
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
conditional license for social work so
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
you know I I kind of saw okay I can see
 
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
where where part of this is duplicative
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
because it's all kind of integrated but
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
then I think what we're doing is this
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
also refers back to
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
330a which is mental health practice
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
section so by repealing this particular
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
um statute that has an older language
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's not used in many other cases
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
anymore what we're doing is we're going
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
to leave that the regulation we're not
 
00:31:56.509 --> 00:31:56.519 align:start position:0%
saying nobody should be supervised but
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to leave the regulation of
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
the supervision agreement to the board
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
which is kicking back to um uh 330a so I
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
actually have pronouns of each of these
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
if you guys would like to have them
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
tangible and kind of look at them um
 
00:32:13.629 --> 00:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
side by side that always helps me but
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's it's not that we're um wanting to
 
00:32:17.629 --> 00:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
get away with this big super it's that
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
we're saying this particular because of
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
the older language because it's
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
duplicative it actually um works against
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
you know being able to provide
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
supervisor that uh that clearcut what's
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
going to happen when they are
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you you're welome we'll this
 
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
will be going to subcommittee to sweat
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
up sweat the details great um so if you
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
could give that those papers to
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative La abely thank you so
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
much for the extra time I appreciate it
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
all right any other

really
 
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
um really started I started opening my
 
00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:11.079 align:start position:0%
eyes onto the idea of human
 
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
trafficking in 2016 and that really
 
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
started back in
 
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
2007 when uh my I went on a mission trip
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
in southern Mexico and it was a remote
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
Town literally in the middle of nowhere
 
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
uh we were going into Villages that were
 
00:45:29.069 --> 00:45:29.079 align:start position:0%
on dirt roads that were you know never
 
00:45:32.549 --> 00:45:32.559 align:start position:0%
never seen a whole lot of traffic um
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
delivering we delivered Healthcare and
 
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
medical services to these folks uh I
 
00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
went back in 2016 and what had happened
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
from 2007 to 2016 was dramatic uh these
 
00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:46.839 align:start position:0%
little towns now the little roads were
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
were Caravans were passing in front of
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
these uh these houses um people from
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
clearly all over the world were were
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
headed north with a lot lot of
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
possessions uh many of them didn't speak
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
most none of them spoke
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
English most of them didn't speak even
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
Spanish uh and certainly not the the the
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
local dialect that we were in so we had
 
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to visually see what was
 
00:46:14.589 --> 00:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
happening going going on down there as
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
we have seen over the last three or four
 
00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:19.559 align:start position:0%
years that is massively exploded to
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
something that we can't even comprehend
 
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
even north of um The Notches where I'm
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
from I grew up in Coos County the
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
Canadian border was always in our
 
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
backyard uh and even now we're seeing
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
crossings that we've never seen before
 
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
uh my neighbor in Littleton is a border
 
00:46:40.109 --> 00:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
patrol agent he says every day they're
 
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
catch they're getting people that are
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
that are migrating and um you know we
 
00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
all know why they're migrating for the
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
most part they're coming here because
 
00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
United States is the best country in the
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
world uh it's a we have freedoms here
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
that are uh un un un unseen in other
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
parts of the the world opportunities
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
that are unseen in parts of the world
 
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
but we wonder when we see all these
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
people how many how many are coming here
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
against their will or how many people
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
signed up for something that uh uh they
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
thought they were getting only to
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
realize that they were being um shuffled
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
moved purchased uh uh trafficked and
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
that's really where this is about HB
 
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
1112 is about human trafficking and it's
 
00:47:22.349 --> 00:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
about the fact that there are people in
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
this country in this state that are here
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
against their will that are here because
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
they didn't understand what they signed
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
up for they're here for profit for
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
gratification uh for for whatever it is
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
but I ask you members of the committee
 
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
here um when how many of you have ever
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
been to a
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
pharmacy how many have ever been to a
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
physician's office how many have ever
 
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
been to an emergency room the reality is
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
people will go to seek medical care
 
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
whether they're here legally or whether
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
they're here undocumented Ed and the
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of the HB 1112 is just an
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh for education of our
 
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
healthc care providers uh our health
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
care providers in our communities in our
 
00:48:10.349 --> 00:48:10.359 align:start position:0%
states whether it be Physicians nurses
 
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:13.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacists dentists we will come in
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
contact with people that are are
 
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
trafficked and HB 1112 one of the things
 
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
it does not do it doesn't add any
 
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
additional education to these folks uh
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
it doesn't add any additional charges
 
00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:29.079 align:start position:0%
fees price cost to to to the licensed
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
Professionals in the state but what it
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
does do it allows oplc as a part of the
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
annual continuing education actually
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's biannual now continuing education
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
process of their required required
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
credits that they have to receive which
 
00:48:49.549 --> 00:48:49.559 align:start position:0%
we all do um one hour of of that b
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
annual uh um education has to be in
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
human trafficking and the idea is really
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
based on the program that came out of
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
Florida and Florida when we renew our
 
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
licenses down in Florida we take an hour
 
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
of human trafficking education it just
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
talks about awareness
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
education what to do what to do about it
 
00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
how to recognize it um and uh and if
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
suspected who to report it to um you
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
know I I've included all kinds of data
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
and and and and dialogue and um
 
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
statistics in the package here uh and
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to to look at it but one
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
of the things that I just want to
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
emphasize is that this is not new this
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
concept of um awareness to certain
 
00:49:38.589 --> 00:49:38.599 align:start position:0%
topics is not new especially human
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
trafficking uh according to the
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%

Florida Louisiana Michigan New Jersey
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
New York Ohio Texas and
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
Washington have um requirements for
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
their health care providers to be
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
educated on human trafficking some of
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
those states are southern states some of
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
them are northern states some of them
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
are are places where we wouldn't
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't expect it but the reality is
 
00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
that it's here uh there's a human United
 
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
States Department of Health and Human
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
and since its Inception it's received
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
571 signals if you will um um in a in a
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
variety of of of formats so that's
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
hotline calls text messages online
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
reports whatnot and in those 571 signals
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh the human trafficking hotline has
 
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:30.200 align:start position:0%

366 were identified that's right here in
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so sobering when you think
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
about this is an underground activity
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
this is an activity that that people
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
don't talk about it's secret it's it's
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
the people are silenced when they talk
 
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
about it so just in New Hampshire 366 V
 
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
victims of an intentionally silenced uh
 
00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:55.720 align:start position:0%
um practice are going on right right
 
00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.390 align:start position:0%
um practice are going on right right
here

00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
um I think when I decided to submit this
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
bill really what what you know I said I
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
I I've thought about it and and and
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
begin to comprehend it and really start
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about how much is out there
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
that we don't see when have we gone to a
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
restaurant and had that whole staff turn
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
over uh with new people and I know that
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
I've been to several of them and
 
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
overnight you know what what's the
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
what's the story behind that it could be
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
innocuous uh it might not be um but the
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
the the the issue that kind of drove at
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
home for me was over the summer when we
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
had a New Hampshire nurse who was
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
working in Haiti uh as a missionary and
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
she was kidnapped and many people
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
speculate that she was kidnapped for the
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of human trafficking and um you
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
know I think that you know to to pretend
 
00:51:46.349 --> 00:51:46.359 align:start position:0%
that it's not here uh is
 
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
shortsighted um this is a bill that is
 
00:51:51.309 --> 00:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
it's it it targets the individuals in
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
the state that will have a high touch
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
with this um and again it's not adding
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
any additional education requirements or
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
or or or or fees that they have to pay
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's part of the uh the normal process
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
of recredentialing in the state of New
 
00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:11.349 align:start position:0%
of recredentialing in the state of New
Hampshire

00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.589 --> 00:52:14.599 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to leave it here with you
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to answer questions I
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
do have to know I'm literally currently
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
presiding over a Board of Pharmacy
 
00:52:22.589 --> 00:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
meeting across the street so I'm happy
 
00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
to take a couple of questions and I've
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
got to get back to to to my meeting
 
00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
representative leus does have a question
 
00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:30.799 align:start position:0%
sure thank you um I'm just trying to
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
reconcile you know uh what I heard you
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
say and what's in the bill and you said
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
that there's uh something about one hour
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
you said there was no additional
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
training requirements and and no
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
additional cost but this thing requires
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
at least two hours of continuing
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
education in this area so that doesn't
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
seem to Jive and uh and that's got to be
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
paid for somehow I mean you there's
 
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
going to be maybe some change the cost
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
to that or something so I don't
 
00:52:58.109 --> 00:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
understand your testimony sure
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely so every health professional
 
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
in in in New Hampshire has to in order
 
00:53:04.829 --> 00:53:04.839 align:start position:0%
as a part of recredentialing every year
 
00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
has to do a certain number of hours
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
every every every two years in my case
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
as a pharmacist I have to do 30 hours of
 
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
um continuing education every other year
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
to continue to get my to get my license
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh so this is not adding an additional
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
two hours but of those 30 hours of the
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
hours that profession are required to to
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
to to to do in order to to get their
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
license two of them per two per B any
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
one per year uh has to be in this topic
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
and it's not an additional fee in that
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to pay for they're
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
paying for these hours anyway uh if we
 
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
don't have this bill it's not they're
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
not paying anything additional they're
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
going to be paying we don't have this
 
00:53:47.549 --> 00:53:47.559 align:start position:0%
they'll pay for something else um so
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's not adding any additional burden on
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
the uh uh as far as a cost or or or hour
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
requirement followup followup
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
um well presumably in the case of
 
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
pharmacist the 30 hours was uh hopefully
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
being consumed uh teaching something of
 
00:54:05.069 --> 00:54:05.079 align:start position:0%
some value so you're going to take two
 
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
hours away from that for this and you
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
know what's going to be lost as part of
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
that I have to wonder yeah I mean I mean
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
30 hours is a lot of hours I mean just
 
00:54:18.829 --> 00:54:18.839 align:start position:0%
just in in in in again speaking from
 
00:54:22.349 --> 00:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
from personal experience if you're going
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
through the motions if you will if
 
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
you're if you're if you're attending
 
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
professional uh continued education in
 
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
the normal course of your career you're
 
00:54:33.549 --> 00:54:33.559 align:start position:0%
going to get far more than that um you
 
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
know already you know at the end of last
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
year uh I'm already ahead of what I
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
personally would would normally get um
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
and you know there's no specification on
 
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
what those as it is now there's no
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
specifications of what those hours could
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
be so conceivably if you found 30 uh
 
00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:53.710 align:start position:0%
be so conceivably if you found 30 uh
hours

00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:54:57.789 --> 00:54:57.799 align:start position:0%
you know HIV counseling which is good
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
right I mean I'm not going to say but
 
00:55:02.109 --> 00:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
you could load up your entire 30 hours
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
with something that may or may not be
 
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
you know pertaining to your to your
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
specialty all right thank you yeah all
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
right thank you rent froda yes I think
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
this might help um because I'm a little
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
bit confused in the in your continuing
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
hours is it not part of the um your
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
rules for lure the 30 hours
 
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
are cover these specific subjects or is
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
it and that you have like a menu and you
 
00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:36.039 align:start position:0%
can pick two from a and three from B is
 
00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
that what is it what your is this can
 
00:55:40.349 --> 00:55:40.359 align:start position:0%
you help us on that absolutely so when
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
when when a board defines what the hours
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
have to be in so for instance I can
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
speak for myself my daughter's a nurse I
 
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:49.960 align:start position:0%
can speak for her um you know my
 
00:55:52.109 --> 00:55:52.119 align:start position:0%
brother's a dentist we can you know what
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
what the rules what the rules say is
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
they have specific spefically for for
 
00:55:57.309 --> 00:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
going to give you the example in
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy they have to
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
be Pharmacy uses ACP approved credit
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
hours so APC ACP is the national
 
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
credentialing Agency for crediting so if
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
I want to put a course on I want people
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
to be to get credit for it I have to run
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
it through this ACP so they have to be
 
00:56:16.559 --> 00:56:17.589 align:start position:0%
it through this ACP so they have to be
15

00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
15
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
hours 30 hours every other year uh ACP
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
approved credit hours so that could be
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
anything I mean it's a if if when I get
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
my license and I have to renew it I
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
could get you know in when you go I mean
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
the providers of acpe credit hours are
 
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
are wide and they're varied I mean
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
literally hundreds if not thousands of
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
courses that you can take that are ACP
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
accredited and I can take um find those
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
courses in in in and there are many many
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
because so many states are doing this
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of acpe accredited
 
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
courses in human trafficking so it's not
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
going to be hard to find one of these
 
00:57:00.829 --> 00:57:00.839 align:start position:0%
courses uh for that those folks okay
 
00:57:02.589 --> 00:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
that was my follow-up question so thanks
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
so much yeah and you know I'm going to
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
add you know if if if we were the if we
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
were the uh the Trailblazers in this you
 
00:57:12.029 --> 00:57:12.039 align:start position:0%
know if if we were the first ones out of
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
the gate then that would quite frankly
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
probably impose a hardship um but
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
because there are so many other states
 
00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:23.559 align:start position:0%
doing it there are a lot of many of the
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh credit Prov providers are providing
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
credits geared towards this requirement
 
00:57:32.589 --> 00:57:32.599 align:start position:0%
representative Shu thank you madam chair
 
00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:34.839 align:start position:0%
that that basically answered my question
 
00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
if there were people provided to do the
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
education okay other questions
 
00:57:42.029 --> 00:57:42.039 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
chair I know you're in a hurry um no
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned that several other
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
states are have already implemented this
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
are there measurable successes that you
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
can report in that area that you know of
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
where implementing it has helped to
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
um pinpoint traffic trafficking yeah you
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
know first there's two ansers I'm gonna
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
answer that in two ways one it's a it's
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
um fairly new in that uh only within the
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
last five or six years that that we've
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
seen this implementation of that uh I
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
think if there was probably a state that
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
could quantify it I don't have those
 
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
numbers in front of me um and I'm I'm
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
I'm surmising that Florida Florida has
 
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
really been out front with with a lot of
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
this um and in fact I believe there's a
 
00:58:31.029 --> 00:58:31.039 align:start position:0%
conference just this afternoon at the
 
00:58:33.029 --> 00:58:33.039 align:start position:0%
the holiday in talking about a Florida
 
00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:35.039 align:start position:0%
based uh human
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
trafficking program that that is is
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
geared towards hotel in the hotel
 
00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
industry uh you know I I I don't have
 
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:45.559 align:start position:0%
numbers that I can put on on hand I
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
would speculate if there are it would be
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
either the University of Michigan or the
 
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
State of Florida that would have
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
those thank you other questions
 
00:58:57.309 --> 00:58:57.319 align:start position:0%
represent VY thank you madam chair a
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
quick one are you um through this bill
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
are you putting it such that just like
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
the abuse and neglect are to be reported
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
this also has to be a reporting uh event
 
00:59:17.549 --> 00:59:17.559 align:start position:0%
for any uh pharmacist yes thank you for
 
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
the question and you know this is just
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
an education component of this bill um
 
00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
this is when I when I put this together
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
I with the director of oplc and I asked
 
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
how we could do this um and and and and
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
she suggested you know this would be the
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
the format that we would go but it's
 
00:59:39.549 --> 00:59:39.559 align:start position:0%
again it's just the education I don't
 
00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
want to deputize every health care
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
provider in mandate that you know you
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
you get into adding that because I think
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
that opens a can of worms um but it's
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
the idea of recognizing it and and
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
understanding if you see it this is how
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
you would be it this this bill does not
 
01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
have a requirement for reporting but it
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
certainly um you know having gone
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
through a lot of these trainings uh
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
there is a you know they often do detail
 
01:00:11.309 --> 01:00:11.319 align:start position:0%
on how you would report something like
 
01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
this but there is no duty to report in
 
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.270 align:start position:0%
this but there is no duty to report in
this

01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you okay thank you very much

good morning Madam chair um members of
 
01:01:15.029 --> 01:01:15.039 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Ben Bradley I'm
 
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
the vice president state government
 
01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:17.799 align:start position:0%
relations with the New Hampshire
 
01:01:20.829 --> 01:01:20.839 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association representing all 26
 
01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's hospitals as well as
 
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:24.839 align:start position:0%
all specialty hospitals throughout New
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh while we appreciate the
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
focus of HB 1112 and the importance of
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
training in human trafficking each
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
professional board that regulates health
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
professionals already has the statutory
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
authority to require specific training
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
as they see
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
fit although there may be other worthy
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
training topics for health professionals
 
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
on topics such as reporting of elderly
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
abuse or communicable disease this would
 
01:01:52.589 --> 01:01:52.599 align:start position:0%
be the only education requirement
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
mandated by the legislature historically
 
01:01:58.269 --> 01:01:58.279 align:start position:0%
except for opioid prescribing training
 
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
requirements that were repealed last
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
year the legislature had has left
 
01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
decisions about mandated training to the
 
01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
professional boards with oversight of
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
health professionals we believe these
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
decisions are best suited for each
 
01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
professional board to determine and
 
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
therefore the hospital Association is
 
01:02:18.269 --> 01:02:18.279 align:start position:0%
respectfully unable to support this bill
 
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the opportunity to
 
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
provide our comments and I'm happy to
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
take your
 
01:02:23.359 --> 01:02:24.990 align:start position:0%
take your
questions

01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative G thank you
 
01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
question my question is do you think
 
01:02:35.789 --> 01:02:35.799 align:start position:0%
this is a topic that the boards are
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
aware enough of to even be on their
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
radar um I haven't solicited each board
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
but you did just hear from the a member
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
of uh the pharmacy board so um it's
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
attuned to him um uh and and so I I
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
can't comment on everybody but um I
 
01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
would suggest that they review the
 
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
training of their licenses
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
routinely represent leus thank you I I
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
can't comment on pharmacies but I can't
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
remember being in any medical facility
 
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:12.039 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have some notices up about
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
reporting if you feel threatened at home
 
01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
or other things like that so my question
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
is um along with that are hospitals and
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
other medical facilities uh doing some
 
01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
you know what what if any training goes
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
along with those notices for the staff
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
already certainly I I think hospitals
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
take this issue very seriously um again
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
I haven't solicited all our hospitals to
 
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
find out what kind of training they
 
01:03:38.029 --> 01:03:38.039 align:start position:0%
provide in human trafficking um I'm
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
really just hoping to speak to the bill
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
and and what it does which is um would
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
have the legislature mandate specific
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
training on human trafficking um I'm
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
happy to get additional information for
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
you um but we do take this issue very
 
01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
seriously disrespectfully uh believe
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
that it should be at the board level for
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
determining what should be required
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
follow yeah I'd appreciate if you could
 
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
do it and that it does apply to the bill
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
because if you know if there is
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
something going on already um about this
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that we're requiring some
 
01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
of the currently existed training would
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
be the best way to go understood okay
 
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.029 align:start position:0%
be the best way to go understood okay

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.630 align:start position:0%
disorders we are the
largest

01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
largest
 
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
um through State contracts funded to
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
provide professional development
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
training for people who work in um
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
use I would be opposed to this
 
01:05:26.279 --> 01:05:28.990 align:start position:0%
use I would be opposed to this
bill

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:05:32.269 --> 01:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
because when you have a requirement that
 
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
years it tends to be something that is
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
broad-based like the ones that we
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
currently have which are ethics people
 
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
are required to get ethics every two
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
years they're supposed to um get suicide
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
prevention training every two
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
years the increase of suicide training
 
01:05:58.990 --> 01:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
was done through a legislative process
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
so there is a precedent out there to
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
create training imposed by the
 
01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
legislature because that's how several
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
Prevention the topic of human
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
trafficking we have offered at the
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.470 align:start position:0%
 
on

01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.789 --> 01:06:29.799 align:start position:0%
at least for at least six
 
01:06:33.269 --> 01:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
years and when this the state got
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
funding for a state opioid response the
 
01:06:35.359 --> 01:06:36.829 align:start position:0%
funding for a state opioid response the
sore

01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
sore
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
funding a lot of human trafficking was
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
happening related to
 
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
opiates that people that were um being
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
trafficked would be forced to become
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
addicted to opiates so that they could
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
be managed and
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
controlled by the opit so you had to do
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
certain things and then you would then
 
01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
you would get your fix and then you know
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
so there was a lot of human trafficking
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
happening so the mental health and
 
01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
substance use provider communities have
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
been getting training in in human
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
trafficking for a while I could see it
 
01:07:16.029 --> 01:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
as a valuable thing for initial lure so
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
that people start off knowing about it
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
but as a a requirement to get more
 
01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
training about it every two years it
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
runs into to a problem where it's the
 
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
same training every time so that there
 
01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.430 align:start position:0%
same training every time so that there
are

01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
um less trainings available for people
 
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
offered Prof you know a lot in other
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
states New Hampshire is stronger when it
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
comes to the professional development
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
education than Maine or Vermont um
 
01:07:59.069 --> 01:07:59.079 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts very strong but in terms
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
of the number of trainings provided it
 
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
would be difficult if it is
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
mandated for mental health providers
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
then it's logical to think
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
that the the state would support
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development and they would
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
um provide funding for that type of
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
education especially if it's being
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
offered at the level that it would take
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
to reach all of the providers which
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
would be several a year um so although
 
01:08:38.349 --> 01:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
it's not a direct cost there would
 
01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
definitely be an indirect cost providers
 
01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
we do have to get substance use
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
um education for renewal in in the um
 
01:08:53.789 --> 01:08:53.799 align:start position:0%
the mental health substance use space
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
space it's 40 to 48 Hours a year and
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
representative lus is correct that if we
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
are doing the um the human trafficking
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
education chances are something else is
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
not going to be what we're going to get
 
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
in so I would say yes that human
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
trafficking education is important um
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
with the way things are happening with
 
01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:24.910 align:start position:0%
with the way things are happening with
um

01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
so many people coming into the country
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
undocumented that chances are there's a
 
01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
lot more human trafficking than we have
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
any concept
 
01:09:33.679 --> 01:09:35.510 align:start position:0%
any concept
of

01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
and I I think it's an important thing to
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
have I'm just not sure that two hours
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
every two years for every health care
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
provider is the way to do
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
it thank you for your testimony are
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
there any questions representative gold
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question and sor sorry to ask
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
so many questions today um my question
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
is I like what you said about um a
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
requirement for licensing initially
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
upfront as opposed to the ongoing
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
requirement do you think that's
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
something that can be done through
 
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
licensing rather than through
 
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
legislative action I think it can
 
01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely be done through
 
01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.149 align:start position:0%
absolutely be done through
administrative

01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:10:15.159 --> 01:10:17.030 align:start position:0%
administrative
rule

01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
um the value when you do something
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
through lure versus through
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
administrative rule is that lure can
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
make it happen
 
01:10:25.679 --> 01:10:27.870 align:start position:0%
make it happen
faster

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
faster
 
01:10:30.669 --> 01:10:30.679 align:start position:0%
um and so I guess that's a decision that
 
01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
for I think now
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
that oplc manages so much more of what
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
the boards are doing that it'll be
 
01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.950 align:start position:0%
the boards are doing that it'll be
easier

01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
easier
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
to change Rule and have it broadly
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
applied so that the changes that were
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
made in the last legislative session um
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
could actually
 
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
benefit making this happen at a
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
different rate than what it would have
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
if those things didn't happen thank
 
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
it okay fair enough other
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you Douglas AER
 
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:38.910 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you Douglas AER
hat

01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
good morning dougo Soler how of thec uh
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
I don't have the office doesn't take a
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
position on this I really came up
 
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
because I have more clarifying questions
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
I think there's some ambiguity around
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
some of the language I think first off
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
one of those is whether whether the two
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
hours is part of say a 30h hour
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
requirement or if that's above and
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
beyond I'm not sure it's clear from this
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
language and then the second piece I
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
have a question about is the definition
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
of audit uh if that is a separate
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
process or if that's just part of the
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
renewal process if it's part of the
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
renewal process just making a
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
requirement um would make this audit
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
language somewhat redundant and then
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
based on the testimony I just heard I do
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
want to clarify that oplc would not be
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
able to mandate that the boards undergo
 
01:12:28.669 --> 01:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
this in rule the boards would still be
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
able to set their own criteria for lure
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh so to your question representative if
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
you wanted to apply to all the boards
 
01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
legislation may be proper if you wanted
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
to give the boards the ability to choose
 
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
rule may be the appropriate rout but
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's more just
 
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
Technical and that's that's all I wanted
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
to say today all right we do have a
 
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
question representative ship thank thank
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um I will ask my
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
question now I I was looking at this and
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
considering if uh oplc thinks the boards
 
01:13:06.669 --> 01:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
would be amenable to just changing the
 
01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
language to say that um there should be
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
an update uh of continuing education on
 
01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.430 align:start position:0%
an update uh of continuing education on
this

01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
topic I'm not sure I could answer that
 
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
question without talking to the boards
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
first because I can't speak on behalf of
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
the different professional boards who
 
01:13:29.149 --> 01:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
would probably also vary from one board
 
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
next yes representative Manti thank you
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh do you know of any boards
 
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.070 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh do you know of any boards
under

01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
OPC that has this requirement education
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
of identifying human trafficking as we
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
speak today I'm going to say no but
 
01:13:53.709 --> 01:13:53.719 align:start position:0%
there's also 57 separate boards and I'm
 
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
not necessarily familiar with the
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
individual education requirements within
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
boards uh I'm interested in your comment
 
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
on the audit because
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative berford did not mention
 
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
that and what I don't know what shall
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
audit compliance does that mean 1% 10%
 
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
50% well I think that's my question here
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
as well and then also um to that point
 
01:14:25.149 --> 01:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
if you make it part of the CE renewal
 
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
process will always check two hours of
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
continuing education I'm not sure there
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
would need to be a separate audit it
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
would just be part of the renewal
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
process okay but it it doesn't Define do
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
you currently audit continuing education
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
and if so
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
how it varies it varies thank you I'm
 
01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.229 align:start position:0%
how it varies it varies thank you I'm
not

01:14:47.229 --> 01:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
surprised all right any other
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative lacus
 
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
one more question on that so um when you
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
say a check on it I know it varies but I
 
01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
mean is there a tendency just to verify
 
01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
that they file the paperwork that they
 
01:15:07.629 --> 01:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
say they had the class do you somehow go
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
back to whoever off the class make sure
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
they were really there or something like
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
that it does vary I mean there certain
 
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
things you can do you can upload uh
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
continuing education certificates
 
01:15:20.189 --> 01:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
there's certain reporting requirements
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
but it does uh vary from board to board
 
01:15:25.149 --> 01:15:25.159 align:start position:0%
and there are some boards I can't think
 
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
of them off the top of my head because
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not involved in the audit side but
 
01:15:31.629 --> 01:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
that do require certain mandates every
 
01:15:34.669 --> 01:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
now and then a little deeper dive for
 
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
for the continuing education component
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay um followup yeah followup um yeah I
 
01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
mean I wasn't sure what that meant and
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
um I guess it it gives 541 a Ru making
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
so you'd have to if this passed you'd
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
have to go through that process to
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
Define just what an audit me anti spells
 
01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
but it's not specified here is that that
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
the case I I think so all right thank
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
Vera I just want to help um with it with
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
this um with this
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
bill um Mr a how you might remember and
 
01:16:13.709 --> 01:16:13.719 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong that last we we
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
move the um responsibility of monitoring
 
01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
the continuing education process uh from
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine to oplc
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
and we had to have a a small
 
01:16:29.709 --> 01:16:29.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment at the end of the we all might
 
01:16:32.669 --> 01:16:32.679 align:start position:0%
remember this at the end of the January
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
4th or third I can't remember house
 
01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
session where we um had to have an
 
01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
amendment removing the responsibility of
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
that auditing from the Board of Medicine
 
01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
so that's an example of an audit of a is
 
01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.310 align:start position:0%
so that's an example of an audit of a is
that

01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
right yes it would be an example okay
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions all right thank you
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
very much for your
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
testimony does anyone else wish to
 
01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
1112 okay in that case I'm closing the
 
01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:11.480 align:start position:0%

uh

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:30:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
de

01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%

House Bill 1410 and I call the co the
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
absence of the spon the prime sponsor I
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
leus uh thank you madam chair uh little
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
history on this um this was among a
 
01:30:53.229 --> 01:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
number of bills that uh were requested
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
by the governor it was put together as
 
01:30:58.669 --> 01:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
were the others in uh consultation with
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
executive director Courtney of oplc and
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
I was asked to uh to run it through the
 
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
process um executive director Courtney
 
01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
had assured me she'd be here for this
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
hearing I'm not seeing her on uh but um
 
01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
so I can go give a quick overview on
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
this um but I'm not uh prepared to go
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:29.109 --> 01:31:29.119 align:start position:0%
um so the uh I'll skip actually part one
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
and go through the other ones first most
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
I mean a lot of this is similar things
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
that we've done with um you know with
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
other licensing boards especially last
 
01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
year the um um part two on the nurse
 
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
Practice Act Board of
 
01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:46.790 align:start position:0%
Practice Act Board of
Nursing

01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
Nursing
 
01:31:49.629 --> 01:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
um you know a good part of this is
 
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
changing the uh the members MIP of the
 
01:31:57.229 --> 01:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
nursing board um the number of members
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
who's on it it adds uh you know APNs or
 
01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:03.400 align:start position:0%
RNs instead of just RNs um in a number
 
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
of places and there's changes to uh the
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
requirements for being on the board here
 
01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
similar to what was done for other
 
01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:12.870 align:start position:0%
similar to what was done for other
boards

01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
boards
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
um some language
 
01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
changes the uh third part third section
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
which is starts on page two line 23 gets
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
into the powers and duties of the board
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
and again this is largely um going along
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
with the changes we've had of moving
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
certain responsibilities from the boards
 
01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:34.070 align:start position:0%
certain responsibilities from the boards
to

01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:36.870 align:start position:0%
to
oplc

01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
um that's I think that's pretty much
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
what's in that
 
01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:43.629 align:start position:0%
what's in that
one

01:32:43.629 --> 01:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
um okay and similarly on the next on uh
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
part four and Page
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
Three um is makes some changes to the uh
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
Ru making Authority and it moves um some
 
01:33:00.109 --> 01:33:00.119 align:start position:0%
of it from the board to oplc because
 
01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility for some issuing licenses
 
01:33:06.189 --> 01:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
and other things were were moved as well
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
so all of that is is pretty similar to
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
what we've been doing uh similarly part
 
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
five related to criminal background
 
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
checks follows um you know other changes
 
01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:18.870 align:start position:0%
checks follows um you know other changes
we

01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
made and part six changes um the LNA
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
seven make some other changes to the
 
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
nursing license um what I'd like to do
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
there's there's uh two other people here
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
who can get into the de well first of
 
01:33:49.629 --> 01:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
all get into the more of the reasons
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
behind this and um
 
01:33:55.149 --> 01:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
that's miss jurius you know if she could
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
speak on that and then um director
 
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
Courtney for the details um of the bill
 
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
from oplc and that's that's all I
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
have thank
 
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
you Miss
 
01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
jurius if you if you could speak on the
 
01:34:18.990 --> 01:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
Bill yes thank you madam chair and good
 
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
morning everybody
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
um for the record de jurus from the
 
01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
governor's office um Governor s's policy
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
director um so the intention behind this
 
01:34:31.950 --> 01:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
bill you'll be seeing a few before you I
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
believe um I think a number of them
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
might be going to subcommittee I may
 
01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
have heard from the chair uh similar to
 
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
bill is this bill is in fact going to
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
set a commit okay great so I'd be happy
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
to be here to be a resource for that as
 
01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
well um this is a continuation of a lot
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
of the policy initiatives that we kind
 
01:34:50.669 --> 01:34:50.679 align:start position:0%
of started um last year as you'll recall
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
there was a hefty chunk of the budget um
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal that was
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
regulatory reform specific to licensing
 
01:34:59.629 --> 01:34:59.639 align:start position:0%
boards so this is along the same lines
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
of that idea which is trying to um
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
consolidate boards where appropriate to
 
01:35:07.149 --> 01:35:07.159 align:start position:0%
rightsize them to ensure that regulation
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
is still appropriate with the Board of
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
Nursing um but getting the membership to
 
01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
a more manageable amount while still
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
making sure that appropriate parties are
 
01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
represented um additionally um some of
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
the repeals would be for um additional
 
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
burdensome red tape or fees for lenses
 
01:35:26.910 --> 01:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
or people who are working in the state
 
01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
um to try to reduce barriers to entering
 
01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
the workforce or continuing in that
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
regard um so specifically I know the LNA
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
license is a is a Hot Topic and I'm sure
 
01:35:39.550 --> 01:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
something we will continue to discuss um
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
but part of the consideration is there's
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
already a federal requirement that they
 
01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
are on a registry that's
 
01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
maintained and the condition for lure is
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
that they complete the cours workk to be
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
on that registry and then pay the state
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
of fee to to do their job and so our
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
thought is could we eliminate that extra
 
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
fee and just allow them to work without
 
01:36:02.669 --> 01:36:02.679 align:start position:0%
that and there's still the oversight
 
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
from the federal registry so that would
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
be the policy consideration there um I'm
 
01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any other specifics but
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
does that give you a good sense of where
 
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
we're coming
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
from representative pra thank you thank
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
you Miss Jewish most of these um the
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
components of this bill were House Bill
 
01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.189 align:start position:0%
components of this bill were House Bill
too

01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
correct I believe that is the case and
 
01:36:28.109 --> 01:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
uh if I may I'll just add I think some
 
01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
of the cleanup language some of the
 
01:36:33.149 --> 01:36:33.159 align:start position:0%
striketh through in this is a result of
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
when there was reconciling as we know
 
01:36:36.669 --> 01:36:36.679 align:start position:0%
there were a number of different bills
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
and I think as they were signed
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
effective dates were different there
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
might have been some language that was
 
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
removed reinserted um that this
 
01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:46.360 align:start position:0%
committee would have pass so I believe
 
01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:48.679 align:start position:0%
some of it the bulk of the text is kind
 
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
of clean up from that piece of it when
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
you were clarifying ining and the
 
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
results from the
 
01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
2022 330 study committee which the bill
 
01:37:01.390 --> 01:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
from 23 the number is escaping me at
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
this point but I think a lot of those
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
changes kind of were reverted back so
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
this is kind of writing that piece of it
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so last year in
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
655 yes which was also included in House
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 we considered that bill and made
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of changes to oplc based on that
 
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
um what information do you have if any
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
that those changes have come to fruition
 
01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
and there's been a benefit
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
scene um I'm happy to answer that in
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
part I would defer I believe you'll hear
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
from executive director Courtney she
 
01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
could speak to specifics about um the
 
01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
pace at which they are able to award the
 
01:37:42.589 --> 01:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
licenses due to the transfer of that
 
01:37:44.589 --> 01:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
Authority um I don't have those figures
 
01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
in front of me but I do know that the
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
turnaround time for licensing those
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
specific um professions has been cut
 
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
down drastically so between the
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
completion of application and the
 
01:37:57.550 --> 01:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
awarding of the license um has been much
 
01:37:59.589 --> 01:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
quicker I think the roll out for other
 
01:38:01.629 --> 01:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
things such as disciplinary actions
 
01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
where they um they can investigate
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
immediately that timeline I think will
 
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
need to be played out over the longer
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
course I'm not sure we've seen direct
 
01:38:11.070 --> 01:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
results but again I'll defer to her on
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
those specific metrics thank you
 
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
yep other questions thank you very much
 
01:38:20.189 --> 01:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
and I trust you'll be able to support
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee
 
01:38:22.239 --> 01:38:23.350 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee
happy

01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
happy
 
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
too okay um I think I will ask director
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
Courtney to give us some details so we
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
ask thank you madam chair Lindsay
 
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
courney executive director office of
 
01:38:48.910 --> 01:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
professional life insurance
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
certification and um please is my my
 
01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
apologies for the delay in my arrival I
 
01:38:55.709 --> 01:38:55.719 align:start position:0%
was with the Senate um testifying on
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
another matter so essentially I just
 
01:39:00.030 --> 01:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to explain what this bill does
 
01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
practically um and how we would
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
administer this bill if it were passed
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
um so two things are easy to explain it
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
would essentially eliminate the
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
requirement um to register medical
 
01:39:14.589 --> 01:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
technicians and the requirement to
 
01:39:17.149 --> 01:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
license Medical Imaging and
 
01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
radiation technologist which is not an
 
01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
actual license type so you should know
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
that there are a number over 10
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
modalities that have their separate
 
01:39:27.589 --> 01:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
license types but it's essentially all
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
of the Imaging licenses that fall under
 
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
the Advisory Board um for that
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um so then with respect to
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
lnas what this does is it eliminates The
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
Lure component um for the licensed
 
01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
nursing assistance while allowing um
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
those individuals to retain the title so
 
01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
essentially providing title protection
 
01:39:52.109 --> 01:39:52.119 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to explain how that works
 
01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
practically with the office right now so
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
there is a a federal requirement um in
 
01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:01.159 align:start position:0%
the cfrs that all states have uh a
 
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism to approve programs that will
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
educate um individuals they use the term
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
nurse aid but other states use certified
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
nursing assistance nursing assistance
 
01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistance um that we
 
01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
educate with a certain minimum number of
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
hours in the Federal Regulations I
 
01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:23.639 align:start position:0%
believe it's 75 we requ 100 and that um
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
as as soon as and that they pass a
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
competency evaluation and it requires
 
01:40:30.589 --> 01:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
that as soon as the person completes
 
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
that process that we automatically
 
01:40:35.550 --> 01:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
register them with the state within 30
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
days and what this means is there's no
 
01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
application process um and because uh
 
01:40:44.589 --> 01:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
the state primarily Department of Health
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
and Human Services receives money from
 
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government for maintaining
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
this registry um we are not allowed to
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
charge people to be on the registry we
 
01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
also have a lenser component which comes
 
01:40:58.910 --> 01:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
into place after somebody is registered
 
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
so the way it works is you complete the
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
course you take your competency
 
01:41:05.950 --> 01:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
evaluation we get the information from
 
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
the testing facility we put the
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
applicant into our licensing system and
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's called Uh not licensed registry
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
only and then at some point if they
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
choose to do so they apply with their
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
office they pay a 30 $ 5 lure fee they
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
pay a $28 fee toward the professionals
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
health program they undergo a criminal
 
01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
history record check and we issue a
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
license two years later they have to um
 
01:41:35.149 --> 01:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
their required registry and then two
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
years from the date of their license
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
renew their license I will say that it
 
01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
is somewhat confusing for applicants
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
this duplicative process um but I also
 
01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out the key differences
 
01:41:51.149 --> 01:41:51.159 align:start position:0%
between our current process and and what
 
01:41:53.709 --> 01:41:53.719 align:start position:0%
is proposed so the differences are that
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
under what is proposed in the bill um
 
01:41:59.550 --> 01:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
the lnas would not be required to
 
01:42:02.109 --> 01:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
undergo a criminal history records check
 
01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
by the office um there are some
 
01:42:06.510 --> 01:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
requirements for long-term care
 
01:42:08.109 --> 01:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
facilities and for hospitals that
 
01:42:10.109 --> 01:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
require criminal history records checks
 
01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
but that would be conducted by the
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
employer and it not be conducted by the
 
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
licensing Authority so that's a key
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
difference the other key difference is
 
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
that um under the federal regulations
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
the employer is required to provide a uh
 
01:42:27.589 --> 01:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
attribute expenses for licensing lnas to
 
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
the registry as opposed to the license
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
um and we get a DI Minimus amount from
 
01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
DHHS and I think that they uh would be
 
01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
required to give us substantially more
 
01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
um under the bill as proposed but again
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's just a selfish uh ask from the
 
01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
office uh not speaking to the policy
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
considerations so those are the the
 
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
primary differences I'd be happy to
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
have I have uh one
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
question I from study committee I was on
 
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
some years ago the scope of practice for
 
01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
an LNA primarily on nursing homes rather
 
01:43:09.390 --> 01:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
than hospitals and other places that
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
lnas work in New Hampshire yeah so I
 
01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
will say that the authority that the
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
federal government has to impose lure
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
requirements and we are always I say we
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
uh oplc in is always protective of the
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
state's authority to to regulate
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
occupations as opposed to the federal
 
01:43:28.589 --> 01:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
government but the federal government's
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
authority to impose this um these
 
01:43:33.629 --> 01:43:33.639 align:start position:0%
registration requirements has to do with
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
our acceptance of their funding and I
 
01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
mean dhs's acceptance of their funding
 
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
the State's acceptance of the funding
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
and so it certainly comes through the
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
long-term care process and our
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
regulation of long-term care facilities
 
01:43:49.950 --> 01:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
that said when you look at the federal
 
01:43:52.109 --> 01:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
registry requ requirements we are
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
required to register anybody who has
 
01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
completed this course it doesn't even
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
matter if they work in long-term care it
 
01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if they work period the
 
01:44:01.629 --> 01:44:01.639 align:start position:0%
fact that they are eligible and they
 
01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
completed this course we are required to
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
register them and so by virtue of that
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
it applies to
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
everyone thank you does anyone yes
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative G and then man py thank
 
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you director
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:44:19.149 --> 01:44:19.159 align:start position:0%
question my question is um and you may
 
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
or may not be able to answer that there
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
may be other people here who can answer
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
just let me know my question is uh I'm
 
01:44:27.149 --> 01:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about the criminal background
 
01:44:30.669 --> 01:44:30.679 align:start position:0%
checks and the lack thereof um that this
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
could you know are we creating a hole
 
01:44:35.229 --> 01:44:35.239 align:start position:0%
that people could slip through and so my
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
specific question is around um home
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
health care do you know if that's if the
 
01:44:44.109 --> 01:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
background checks are done by
 
01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
requirement by those um
 
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
agencies I don't know I also don't know
 
01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
that everybody providing Home Health
 
01:44:54.589 --> 01:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
Care is an LNA and I do think that there
 
01:44:57.229 --> 01:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
that's an element um that that's a
 
01:45:01.149 --> 01:45:01.159 align:start position:0%
potential issue um but I don't know for
 
01:45:03.229 --> 01:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
certain I would say that DH a has
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
imposed on the on the individuals that
 
01:45:07.229 --> 01:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
they I'm sorry on the facilities they
 
01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:08.679 align:start position:0%
regulate there are certain requirements
 
01:45:10.750 --> 01:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
for criminal history records checks I
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
would also say that the accrediting
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
bodies uh typically which are private
 
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
typically um do have certain um
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
requirements but the state standards for
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
vetting them are are are
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
beny thank you madam chair thank you uh
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so from the cost
 
01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:40.030 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so from the cost
shifting

01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
shifting
 
01:45:42.910 --> 01:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
perspective this bill would shift the
 
01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.350 align:start position:0%
perspective this bill would shift the
cost

01:45:44.350 --> 01:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:46.719 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
licy to the agency or D HHS or other
 
01:45:53.679 --> 01:45:54.750 align:start position:0%
licy to the agency or D HHS or other
bigger

01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
bigger
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
organizations especially for with the
 
01:46:00.510 --> 01:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
LNA am I correct yes you're correct um
 
01:46:04.270 --> 01:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
and so right now the Board of Nursing is
 
01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
is is not meeting its expenses in large
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
part because we charge lnas so little
 
01:46:12.750 --> 01:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
$35 when the average cost of license is
 
01:46:16.189 --> 01:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
over 150 and obviously that's because um
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
there's a capacity um concern there and
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
um so certainly that would shift the
 
01:46:24.510 --> 01:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
cost you know another way to resolve the
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
issue is to just not charge a fee for
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
lnas um you know I know in the past the
 
01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
board hasn't hasn't
 
01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
um hasn't supported that um but that's
 
01:46:39.149 --> 01:46:39.159 align:start position:0%
another way to um to address that
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
issue thank
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you I'm
 
01:46:48.430 --> 01:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
um your question your comment about the
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing not meeting an
 
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
expenses what does that mean because do
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
you not have a
 
01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
um will you not granted a $5
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
million over you know hold over so that
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
the money that you have an extra could
 
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
be used
 
01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
to yeah so I think those are two
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
different issues so every board is
 
01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
required to cover their 100% of their
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
expenses and I think um representative
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
you may recall that the oplc has had
 
01:47:22.109 --> 01:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
rule making Authority regarding fees for
 
01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
a long time but there have been
 
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
conflicts in the law that have really
 
01:47:28.709 --> 01:47:28.719 align:start position:0%
precluded us from moving that forward um
 
01:47:32.589 --> 01:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
both statutory and and Regulatory we've
 
01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
recently eliminated those
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
conflicts um but for years the
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
established fees you had some boards
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
that were bringing in you know 200% and
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
then other boards that were bringing in
 
01:47:47.589 --> 01:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
40% and so yes we had a lapse but I
 
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
would say it's not it's not because um
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
we had a lapse because certain boards
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
were bringing in way more than they
 
01:47:55.870 --> 01:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
should and it was an essentially an
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional tax so we have enough
 
01:48:02.189 --> 01:48:02.199 align:start position:0%
funding to operate the office but what
 
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is not all boards are meeting
 
01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
their 100% of their expenses and for the
 
01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
board it's been a really big challenge
 
01:48:11.470 --> 01:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
because you can't raise you can't raise
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
LNA fees to $150 you just can't do it um
 
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
they don't get paid enough um and so the
 
01:48:20.669 --> 01:48:20.679 align:start position:0%
board has opted to have their license
 
01:48:22.669 --> 01:48:22.679 align:start position:0%
fees structured in a way that the RNs
 
01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
and aprns are essentially subsidizing
 
01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
the lnas but it's still um not
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
sufficient taking into consideration
 
01:48:31.149 --> 01:48:31.159 align:start position:0%
inflation and everything else follow up
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
follow up so you run the boards as a
 
01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.310 align:start position:0%
follow up so you run the boards as a
cost

01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:48:37.070 --> 01:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
center do I run the boards no it's
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
statutory representative that we are
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
required that the boards uh cover their
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
fully cover their costs if um you know I
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
think there's an opportunity for the
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
legislature to consider from a policy
 
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
standpoint whether they do want
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
subsidization I would think that that
 
01:48:53.950 --> 01:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
would have to come from the general fund
 
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
and not from other boards because you
 
01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
get into the issue of taxing um other
 
01:49:00.669 --> 01:49:00.679 align:start position:0%
licensed professionals but this was this
 
01:49:02.709 --> 01:49:02.719 align:start position:0%
was a statutory scheme created by the
 
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
legislature not the office apologies I
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
me oplc not you personally I understand
 
01:49:13.390 --> 01:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
yes yes um in the oplc reports for the
 
01:49:16.830 --> 01:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
last several years you can see that some
 
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
boards are overcharged and some are
 
01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:20.709 align:start position:0%
boards are overcharged and some are
under

01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
charged and I will say we had a budget
 
01:49:24.669 --> 01:49:24.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative we had a budget
 
01:49:28.270 --> 01:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
information session with the boards I
 
01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
think it was last night I can't even
 
01:49:33.070 --> 01:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
recall maybe the night before um in
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
preparation for FY 26 and 27 and um we
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
are going to um work in tandem with them
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
on the budget as well as uh adopting new
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
rules regarding fees to really level set
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
um but these are some really tough
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
conversations that we have to have
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
particularly for um the licensed
 
01:49:55.629 --> 01:49:55.639 align:start position:0%
professions that um don't don't earn
 
01:49:58.390 --> 01:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
enough thank you other questions
 
01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:00.030 align:start position:0%
enough thank you other questions
representative

01:50:00.030 --> 01:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you madam chair uh good
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
morning director thanks for taking my
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
question good morning representative C
 
01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
can you uh for me put in a simple
 
01:50:13.589 --> 01:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
framework why this is
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
necessary following up kind of on the
 
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
governor's representative so I can't
 
01:50:21.189 --> 01:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
speak to the governor's um initiative
 
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
but what I can say is practically on the
 
01:50:27.070 --> 01:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
elen piece it it definitely would reduce
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh administrative burden it would it
 
01:50:31.589 --> 01:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
would streamline The Lure
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
process um if it were me I would I would
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
say to the feds you need to update your
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
EGS because they haven't been updated
 
01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
since the 70s and I think that's part of
 
01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
the problem um but I think the process
 
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
is somewhat cumbersome for those trying
 
01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
those people trying to navigate that
 
01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
said um and you'll grapple with this
 
01:50:50.189 --> 01:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
there's certainly some policy
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
considerations as I've outlined for you
 
01:50:54.189 --> 01:50:54.199 align:start position:0%
to consider and then on the other piece
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
I think um it's certainly just an ex
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
extension of um some of the efforts last
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
session um which were intended to look
 
01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
at um the board's um or I'm sorry the
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
licensed professions that may not be
 
01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect the public if
 
01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:18.069 --> 01:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
so question represent Simon thank you
 
01:51:19.229 --> 01:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you director for
 
01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question um still just trying
 
01:51:23.069 --> 01:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I have all my
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
information correct on uh the nursing
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
board covering its own expenses so if we
 
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
were not to do the proposal before us um
 
01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
we have a short fall of of essentially
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
$115 per LNA um from the nursing board
 
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
presently you're saying you're stop
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
gapping that by overcharging rnas and
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
other professionals to kind of balance
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
it which doesn't seem correct either
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
so if we don't do something like this
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
aren't we basically putting lnas in the
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
position of having to statutorily
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
speaking if we're going to do it
 
01:51:58.350 --> 01:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
correctly they should be paying $150
 
01:51:59.790 --> 01:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
which doesn't seem fair in its own right
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
but am I correct in that yes I think
 
01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:03.790 align:start position:0%
but am I correct in that yes I think
what

01:52:03.790 --> 01:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
I and I haven't thought this fully
 
01:52:08.910 --> 01:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
through but I think if this were not to
 
01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
pass my recommendation to the board
 
01:52:14.069 --> 01:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
would be to fully eliminate the fee all
 
01:52:16.669 --> 01:52:16.679 align:start position:0%
together so we could have a better sense
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
of um what it costs in order to Main and
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
basically merge the two and what it
 
01:52:25.709 --> 01:52:25.719 align:start position:0%
costs to maintain an LNA license and a
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
registration and I would try to Bill HHS
 
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
to recoup some of his costs I don't know
 
01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
how successful that would be but my
 
01:52:35.310 --> 01:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
position is that essentially we are not
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
getting the funding um that is owed to
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
us follow up um so you had also
 
01:52:44.589 --> 01:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the funding that could
 
01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:46.360 align:start position:0%
potentially come from the federal side
 
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
of things if we were to change would be
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
significant what would that look like do
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
you have any idea what additional
 
01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
funding would come from the federal
 
01:52:54.430 --> 01:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
government so if you think about the
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
fact that the average cost overhead of a
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
lensey is about $150 it's probably gone
 
01:53:01.470 --> 01:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
up since the last an time I analyzed
 
01:53:04.069 --> 01:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
that in my in my opinion if you have
 
01:53:07.069 --> 01:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
10,000 lnas they should be paying that
 
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
full cost um now I don't know how much
 
01:53:13.950 --> 01:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
thhs is recovering from CMS but I
 
01:53:15.550 --> 01:53:15.560 align:start position:0%
suspect that it's probably sufficient to
 
01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
cover that um but I don't know what that
 
01:53:21.790 --> 01:53:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative Schmid thank you mam
 
01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
chair uh is this question this is a
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
bill I knew somewhere but I don't have
 
01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
it in my head I'll get back to you on it
 
01:53:41.629 --> 01:53:41.639 align:start position:0%
okay is it going to a subcommittee it is
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
definitely going to subcommittee I I I
 
01:53:46.589 --> 01:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
assume that but I never like to assume
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
things uh if I can ask so uh
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
um the the the subcommittee situation
 
01:53:57.390 --> 01:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about a lot of
 
01:53:59.310 --> 01:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
people and potentially a lot of money
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
here so uh I'm going to restrict some of
 
01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
my questioning to the subcommittee but
 
01:54:10.270 --> 01:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
um director Courtney uh roughly how many
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
people are be talking about here in New
 
01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think about 10,000 maintain
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
their LNA lure that
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't give us a good idea of who's
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
practicing um so a lot of people just
 
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
maintain their license without regard to
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're using
 
01:54:29.550 --> 01:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
it and how many pink cards do we have
 
01:54:32.669 --> 01:54:32.679 align:start position:0%
from we have a number of people here
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
interested in this bill how many pink
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
cards do we have from there are six
 
01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:38.149 align:start position:0%
cards do we have from there are six
people

01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
regarding Medical Imaging many of them
 
01:54:43.950 --> 01:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
students one person that I believe is
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about the registry of medical
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
technicians and three people regarding
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
the Board of Nursing
 
01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:55.430 align:start position:0%
the Board of Nursing
thank

01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
you

specialty hospitals throughout New
 
01:55:56.030 --> 01:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh as you may know last year's
 
01:55:58.109 --> 01:55:58.119 align:start position:0%
budget negotiations contemplated several
 
01:55:59.830 --> 01:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
Provisions to reform professional LIC
 
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
insure in the office of professional
 
01:56:03.950 --> 01:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
liur and certification including the
 
01:56:06.030 --> 01:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
consolidation or elimination of certain
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
professional boards as noted by the
 
01:56:11.069 --> 01:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
sponsor hb1 1410 mirrors many of those
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
changes proposed last year in hb2 with
 
01:56:16.069 --> 01:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
regard to changes proposed for licensed
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
nursing assistance it appears lnas will
 
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
be able to retain their title as
 
01:56:22.510 --> 01:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistants but instead
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
of applying for lure through the Board
 
01:56:27.510 --> 01:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
of Nursing and paying a licensing fee
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure and
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
certification and the Board of Nursing
 
01:56:34.030 --> 01:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
will simply require their registration
 
01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
which is in line with Federal
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
Regulations Additionally the Board of
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
Nursing would still retain oversight of
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
LNA education programs and ensure
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
integrity and
 
01:56:45.550 --> 01:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
accountability We Believe licensed
 
01:56:47.069 --> 01:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants should be given the
 
01:56:48.669 --> 01:56:48.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in on how these
 
01:56:50.430 --> 01:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
changes excuse me Mr Bradley you don't
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
need to read this to us okay we we've
 
01:56:55.950 --> 01:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
all it is a requirement for for
 
01:56:58.189 --> 01:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
membership on this committee so I check
 
01:57:00.669 --> 01:57:00.679 align:start position:0%
it what understood what's your your if
 
01:57:02.589 --> 01:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
you just explain the highlights to us
 
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's much more effective sure so um we
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
believe the licensed nursing assistant
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
should be able to weigh in uh on how the
 
01:57:13.069 --> 01:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
changes could be beneficial to their
 
01:57:13.079 --> 01:57:16.270 align:start position:0%
changes could be beneficial to their
profession

01:57:16.270 --> 01:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to uh repealing the
 
01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
medical Imaging and radiation therapy
 
01:57:24.589 --> 01:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
board um we believe that a thorough
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
analysis should be uh done to continue
 
01:57:30.030 --> 01:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
to continue to be done to determine
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
whether New Hampshire would be an
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
outlier uh among other states um and the
 
01:57:36.669 --> 01:57:36.679 align:start position:0%
consequences of repealing the license
 
01:57:38.589 --> 01:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
for these IND whether the consequences
 
01:57:41.069 --> 01:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
would be in the best interest of the
 
01:57:44.069 --> 01:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
professionals licensed um as it relates
 
01:57:46.109 --> 01:57:46.119 align:start position:0%
to the board of registration for medical
 
01:57:47.950 --> 01:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
technicians um at this point we're
 
01:57:51.390 --> 01:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
neutral um our hospitals interact with
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
the board of medical with medical
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
technician registry
 
01:57:55.199 --> 01:57:57.069 align:start position:0%
technician registry
regularly

01:57:57.069 --> 01:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
regularly
 
01:57:57.079 --> 01:57:58.629 align:start position:0%
regularly
um

01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:01.229 --> 01:58:01.239 align:start position:0%
um however we're uncertain of the value
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
that the registry brings to their role
 
01:58:05.109 --> 01:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
of ensuring Public Safety is
 
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
supported um we would encourage all
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
parties including individuals subject to
 
01:58:14.589 --> 01:58:14.599 align:start position:0%
the registry uh to uh engage and fully
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
evaluate the scope and function of the
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
Medtech registry um
 
01:58:22.229 --> 01:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
thanks for the opportunity to weigh in
 
01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:32.910 --> 01:58:32.920 align:start position:0%

the hospitals in your Association
 
01:58:40.830 --> 01:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
require background checks criminal
 
01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
history background checks for lnas yes
 
01:58:44.990 --> 01:58:45.000 align:start position:0%

01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh the state Commission on Aging was uh
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
created during the 2019 legislative
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%

state legislature on issues related to

aging and with that in mind we did want
 
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
to provide some input on the bill that
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
you're considering hb1 1410 I do have a
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I will share um
 
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
with you it it um compiles some points
 
01:59:58.990 --> 01:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
raised by various commission members in
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill um as it is written
 
02:00:03.069 --> 02:00:03.079 align:start position:0%
the state Commission on Aging and the
 
02:00:05.550 --> 02:00:05.560 align:start position:0%
long-term care and budman's office um
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
oppose it um both the the portions
 
02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
related to MedEx and the portions Rel
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
related to removing the lure of nursing
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
assistant um I'm just going to hit a
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh let me see uh so among um use of a
 
02:00:28.109 --> 02:00:28.119 align:start position:0%
registry does not enable a board to
 
02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
determine the scope of practice of
 
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
nursing assistance or MedEx um that is
 
02:00:37.709 --> 02:00:37.719 align:start position:0%
um to identify what they are permitted
 
02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
to do or not do Healthcare is a dynamic
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
profession and those who practice
 
02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
Healthcare must continuously adap their
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge and practice um by who without
 
02:00:49.149 --> 02:00:49.159 align:start position:0%
these without the the um without the
 
02:00:50.830 --> 02:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
these boards who will make the decision
 
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
about what the scope of practice is for
 
02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:54.750 align:start position:0%
about what the scope of practice is for
these

02:00:54.750 --> 02:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
professions uh there is concern about
 
02:01:00.430 --> 02:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
that uh that related to lnas that um
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation requires nursing
 
02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
assistance to receive um 12 hours of um
 
02:01:09.390 --> 02:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
annual Continuing Education Without The
 
02:01:12.109 --> 02:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
Lure um there's questions about how that
 
02:01:15.310 --> 02:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
will um that whose burden will that fall
 
02:01:19.069 --> 02:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
to to maintain that um that level of
 
02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
continuing education and there's concern
 
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
that it will fall to
 
02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:26.149 align:start position:0%
that it will fall to
employers

02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
so licensed medical uh um so lnas are in
 
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
every sector of the healthcare industry
 
02:01:43.109 --> 02:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
licing of nursing assistance creates a
 
02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
higher standing standard of safety the
 
02:01:47.910 --> 02:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
commission's understanding is that lnas
 
02:01:50.589 --> 02:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
um do represent a disproportionate
 
02:01:52.589 --> 02:01:52.599 align:start position:0%
number of of complaints that are made to
 
02:01:56.109 --> 02:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
the uh Board of lure removing um
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
removing the
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
lur it just does not seem advisable in
 
02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
this circumstance um less oversight
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem uh to ensure this uh safety
 
02:02:10.350 --> 02:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
in every sector um that we need I am are
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
there I just want to make sure there's a
 
02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
particular point that you wanted to
 
02:02:16.109 --> 02:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
raise yeah I so I I think one of the
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
other points that should be considered
 
02:02:20.069 --> 02:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
is that the license adds a certain
 
02:02:23.229 --> 02:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
stature to for licensed nursing
 
02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
assistance and at a time when we really
 
02:02:27.790 --> 02:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
want to raise this profession up due to
 
02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
the the critical Workforce shortage in
 
02:02:33.149 --> 02:02:33.159 align:start position:0%
healthc care this could be perceived
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
negatively that they're losing lure and
 
02:02:39.390 --> 02:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
and instead becoming a registry and I
 
02:02:42.750 --> 02:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
would um suggest that it as director
 
02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%
Courtney alluded to looking to um
 
02:02:49.109 --> 02:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
streamline the process of the registry
 
02:02:51.149 --> 02:02:51.159 align:start position:0%
and the lure to make it a little less
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
cumbersome for those individuals so we
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
continue to have um a lure which begins
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
to set that career pathway for
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
individuals who become nursing
 
02:03:04.750 --> 02:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
assistants to continue their career in
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
healthcare with additional lure can I
 
02:03:13.470 --> 02:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
inter representative schmi thank you so
 
02:03:15.669 --> 02:03:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh because I'm not sure how long your
 
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
testimony is going to take I'm wondering
 
02:03:20.910 --> 02:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
whether you can just address what a
 
02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
remark you just made so if if that
 
02:03:27.629 --> 02:03:27.639 align:start position:0%
proposed or cons contemplated change
 
02:03:29.550 --> 02:03:29.560 align:start position:0%
were to go through would that have an
 
02:03:32.790 --> 02:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
impact on the cost to the to the lnas
 
02:03:36.669 --> 02:03:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
registration there is no cost for the
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
registration there is a cost for the
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
lure which as director Courtney you know
 
02:03:46.910 --> 02:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
addressed um does not cover the cost of
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
the lure and that would have to be I
 
02:03:51.149 --> 02:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
believe would have to be studied how to
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
address that okay thank you thank
 
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
you there there's just one final point
 
02:03:59.589 --> 02:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
that I would like to make from this
 
02:04:01.109 --> 02:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistants are
 
02:04:02.350 --> 02:04:02.360 align:start position:0%
individually accountable for the
 
02:04:03.549 --> 02:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
Professional Standards under their
 
02:04:06.030 --> 02:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
license how are however certified
 
02:04:07.589 --> 02:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants work under the
 
02:04:09.109 --> 02:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
guidance and direction of a licensed
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
nurse who is then accountable under his
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
own her own license for their
 
02:04:16.750 --> 02:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
performances nurses have a voice that
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
they are uncomfort not comfortable
 
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
accepting this responsibility and this
 
02:04:23.549 --> 02:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
raises concerns for the turn additional
 
02:04:26.830 --> 02:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
turnover of licensed nursing nurses and
 
02:04:29.470 --> 02:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
long-term care that was raised to us by
 
02:04:32.069 --> 02:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
a a long-term care
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
provider thank you that's a very valid
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
point representative
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair so as was
 
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
indicated in earlier testimony there are
 
02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:45.109 align:start position:0%
indicated in earlier testimony there are
some

02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
10,000 uh lnas in New Hampshire
 
02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
currently my understanding is that we
 
02:04:52.109 --> 02:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
have somewhat different structure in New
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire than than virtually all the
 
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
other states to the degree that we would
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh entertain some kind of change how
 
02:05:01.310 --> 02:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
much of a disruption would that make to
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it depends on the change I'm
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
sure I I think that would be my answer
 
02:05:15.549 --> 02:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
it would depend on what the change is um
 
02:05:17.470 --> 02:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
but as I said I I think we need to
 
02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
consider that um
 
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're not devaluating de you know
 
02:05:24.430 --> 02:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
devaluing these individuals that have
 
02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
that are doing this
 
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
work representative G thank you madam
 
02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
question I uh support 100% what you're
 
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
saying in terms of status for licensing
 
02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
my question is I heard um director
 
02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
Courtney say that that really the
 
02:05:45.310 --> 02:05:45.320 align:start position:0%
registration is a license and would be
 
02:05:48.109 --> 02:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
considered a license and that by
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
streamlining in and combining the two is
 
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
it really a change in status or is it
 
02:05:55.069 --> 02:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
just that we've added this additional
 
02:05:58.549 --> 02:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
burden that we can redefine what's
 
02:06:01.549 --> 02:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
currently called registration on a list
 
02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
to licensing would that satisfy it do
 
02:06:04.199 --> 02:06:07.549 align:start position:0%
to licensing would that satisfy it do
you

02:06:07.549 --> 02:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
think in all honesty it it it wasn't
 
02:06:13.390 --> 02:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
clear a registry is different than
 
02:06:15.870 --> 02:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
licensing I would it's not
 
02:06:18.669 --> 02:06:18.679 align:start position:0%
clear would some would an LNA be able to
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
to say that they're still an LNA that
 
02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
they're a licensed nursing assistant
 
02:06:25.030 --> 02:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
where they become a CNA then a a
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
certified nursing assistant and does
 
02:06:29.270 --> 02:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
that still make them feel like they are
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
part of the um an equal member of the
 
02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare team providing um vital care
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
these are people who are the most
 
02:06:38.030 --> 02:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
intimate of of almost anyone in the
 
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare team with the people that
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
they're serving providing very personal
 
02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
care thank you I was one and my daughter
 
02:06:48.990 --> 02:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
is hasard Doctor as a nurse
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
practitioners so thank you very much
 
02:06:53.390 --> 02:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay represent
 
02:06:57.910 --> 02:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
mudy thank you madam chair a quick uh
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
question in terms of how many lnas how
 
02:07:04.270 --> 02:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
many CNAs in the
 
02:07:06.589 --> 02:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
state I believe the Board of Nursing
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
would be better able to answer that
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you
 
02:07:14.750 --> 02:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
correct um so but the this um State
 
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
Commission on Aging has studied the
 
02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
issue of what is the workforce that we
 
02:07:21.790 --> 02:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
need in this state um there's a National
 
02:07:24.030 --> 02:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
Organization Phi that studies the Direct
 
02:07:28.229 --> 02:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
Care Workforce uh they feel um they have
 
02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
made estimations that we will need a
 
02:07:32.830 --> 02:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
significant number of more Nur um
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
certified licensed nursing assistance in
 
02:07:35.199 --> 02:07:36.629 align:start position:0%
certified licensed nursing assistance in
the

02:07:36.629 --> 02:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
future thank you represent Brown uh
 
02:07:42.549 --> 02:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thanks for
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question going back to
 
02:07:46.549 --> 02:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
something you said it might be outlined
 
02:07:49.109 --> 02:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
in your written testimony a little bit
 
02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
better um you said less oversight
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't ensure safety at least that's
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
what I wrote down you may not have said
 
02:07:58.189 --> 02:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
those exact words but uh and and anyone
 
02:07:59.589 --> 02:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
else who comes up to testify
 
02:08:01.149 --> 02:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
subsequently it'd be interested to hear
 
02:08:06.229 --> 02:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
their thoughts on that um so this
 
02:08:08.910 --> 02:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
you you believe that this change in
 
02:08:13.390 --> 02:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
process might result in less oversight
 
02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
and less oversight could be a safety
 
02:08:18.589 --> 02:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
concern is is am I translating what you
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
said I think I asked you four
 
02:08:24.189 --> 02:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
questions so I think that um when we
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
talk about some of the the requirements
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
of the the licensing versus the registry
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
process we have a a Workforce that's
 
02:08:37.390 --> 02:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
very Trent and I I think that the the
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
benefits of having um the responsibility
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
of lure which puts the responsibility on
 
02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:54.350 --> 02:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
be provide for better oversight if that
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
makes sense um an employer is not going
 
02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
to have the average the average employer
 
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
is not going to have a long tenure with
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
that individual to be able to maintain
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
their oversight of their continuing
 
02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
education for instance um okay thank you
 
02:09:16.589 --> 02:09:16.599 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding of the of the
 
02:09:21.470 --> 02:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
process um that um that the and I do not
 
02:09:23.310 --> 02:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
want to speak for director Courtney and
 
02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:24.390 align:start position:0%
want to speak for director Courtney and
the

02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
um um but it's my understanding that the
 
02:09:30.109 --> 02:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
that there's that the office of of of
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
professional lur is is moving towards
 
02:09:34.990 --> 02:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
conducting the investigations and that
 
02:09:36.350 --> 02:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
the boards are moving towards the
 
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
adjudication process of of overseeing um
 
02:09:43.629 --> 02:09:43.639 align:start position:0%
of of hearings related to complaints
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
and it's that type of process if you
 
02:09:48.589 --> 02:09:48.599 align:start position:0%
lose one piece of that what happens to
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
the whole the process as a whole I think
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's where some of the concerns are
 
02:09:54.990 --> 02:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
coming from thank you
 
02:09:58.549 --> 02:09:58.559 align:start position:0%
okay representative Schmid brief one
 
02:10:00.750 --> 02:10:00.760 align:start position:0%

Dingle dimple for representing the

02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
association my handwriting was really
 
02:10:34.270 --> 02:10:34.280 align:start position:0%
bad on that one uh my name is Pam
 
02:10:36.149 --> 02:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
denapoli I'm a registered nurse I live
 
02:10:38.750 --> 02:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
in Manchester and I'm a member of the um
 
02:10:40.709 --> 02:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
n New Hampshire Nurses Association
 
02:10:42.830 --> 02:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
Commission on government Affairs um I'm
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
not going to take a lot of your time
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
because the previous testimony um
 
02:10:48.589 --> 02:10:48.599 align:start position:0%
addressed a lot of the um issues that I
 
02:10:51.149 --> 02:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
want so just to reiterate this was an
 
02:10:54.629 --> 02:10:54.639 align:start position:0%
hb2 last year it was pulled out um at
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
that time New Hampshire Nurses
 
02:10:58.669 --> 02:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
Association opposed those Provisions we
 
02:11:01.069 --> 02:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
were happy when it got pulled out for a
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
further study um I think there are some
 
02:11:06.910 --> 02:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
improvements made by this hb1 1410 but
 
02:11:08.669 --> 02:11:08.679 align:start position:0%
there are still some concerns that we
 
02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
have that need continued thorough study
 
02:11:14.830 --> 02:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
um some of those are um the onus on the
 
02:11:16.910 --> 02:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
employers so the previous discussion
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
about regulation and over site would
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
fall to the employers we do have a
 
02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
document that shows that these
 
02:11:24.189 --> 02:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
Registries there's a number of people
 
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
that are maintained on the registry
 
02:11:28.910 --> 02:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
despite disciplinary action despite
 
02:11:32.350 --> 02:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
having lost their um certification so to
 
02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
speak so there are some concerns with
 
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
maintaining a registry um I think that
 
02:11:39.310 --> 02:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
we're concerned um as also was
 
02:11:42.270 --> 02:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
previously talked about the um impact on
 
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
the pipeline when we surveyed our um
 
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistants 70% of them
 
02:11:49.950 --> 02:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to maintain the license because
 
02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
they felt like the professional stature
 
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
was really important to them um we're
 
02:11:58.350 --> 02:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
concerned that um the scope of practice
 
02:12:00.709 --> 02:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
isn't well defined So currently there's
 
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
a different scope of practice for alenas
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
that work in a nursing home versus a
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
hospital and so those would have to be
 
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
um Justified there's concern about
 
02:12:13.709 --> 02:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
delegation so if these um individuals
 
02:12:16.589 --> 02:12:16.599 align:start position:0%
were no longer licensed would a licensed
 
02:12:18.669 --> 02:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
registered nurse be able to Del at to an
 
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
unlicensed person and that's a concern
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
to us uh there's a concern about what we
 
02:12:25.950 --> 02:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
call these people and it seems silly
 
02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
because a nursing assistant is a nursing
 
02:12:31.470 --> 02:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
assistant but uh are we calling a
 
02:12:33.629 --> 02:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistant somebody when
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're not licensed um a certified
 
02:12:37.709 --> 02:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
nursing assistant would be different but
 
02:12:40.149 --> 02:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
have the same scope of practice are they
 
02:12:42.069 --> 02:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
in the in the bill itself it was called
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
nurses aid nurses assistant licensed
 
02:12:46.950 --> 02:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
nursing assistant so the the title needs
 
02:12:49.629 --> 02:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
to be justified and then also shared
 
02:12:52.350 --> 02:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
with those current lnas um and then
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
finally what's the Authority for the
 
02:12:55.990 --> 02:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing so will the authority
 
02:12:58.589 --> 02:12:58.599 align:start position:0%
of the Board of Nursing for um
 
02:13:01.629 --> 02:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action still be as rigorous
 
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
as it may be now because it was pointed
 
02:13:05.109 --> 02:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
out that there are a number of elenes
 
02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
who um are in the pipeline for
 
02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:09.430 align:start position:0%
who um are in the pipeline for
disciplinary

02:13:09.430 --> 02:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
disciplinary
 
02:13:11.629 --> 02:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
action thank you are there
 
02:13:11.639 --> 02:13:13.510 align:start position:0%
action thank you are there
representative

02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:13:15.750 --> 02:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam
 
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
chair so um
 
02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:20.069 align:start position:0%
chair so um
registered

02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
registered
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
nurses uh
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
RNs um are in point of fact licensed um
 
02:13:29.470 --> 02:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
even though they're still called RNs
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
nobody says registered nurses
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
anymore uh but it's become uh the title
 
02:13:42.549 --> 02:13:42.559 align:start position:0%
like CPAs are certified called certified
 
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
and your question please yes so how does
 
02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
that aspect um you know touch on the
 
02:13:53.229 --> 02:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
question you just raised that's a good
 
02:13:55.790 --> 02:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
point um I think registered nurse is an
 
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
accepted title throughout the country
 
02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
what we have the problem with the CNAs
 
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
so in some like Massachusetts they're
 
02:14:03.549 --> 02:14:03.559 align:start position:0%
called certified nursing assistance in
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they're licensed nursing
 
02:14:07.870 --> 02:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
assistants so the name becomes I think
 
02:14:10.030 --> 02:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
important because we want to talk Apples
 
02:14:12.189 --> 02:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
to Apples and I think that was talked
 
02:14:14.350 --> 02:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
about with the transitory nature of this
 
02:14:17.470 --> 02:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
job you could be a CNA in Massachusetts
 
02:14:20.350 --> 02:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire to be in LNA and
 
02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
there's some confusion there so I I
 
02:14:24.510 --> 02:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
think that that's really it's just for
 
02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
purposes of
 
02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
clarity thank you and and if I can just
 
02:14:31.589 --> 02:14:31.599 align:start position:0%
make one last point on the composition
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
of the Board of Nursing um I think that
 
02:14:36.430 --> 02:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
there was there was mentioned that um
 
02:14:38.589 --> 02:14:38.599 align:start position:0%
that the board would be right sized if
 
02:14:41.430 --> 02:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
they cut it down from 13 to 7 and I
 
02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:42.750 align:start position:0%
they cut it down from 13 to 7 and I
think

02:14:42.750 --> 02:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
um we we need to hear from the Board of
 
02:14:46.549 --> 02:14:46.559 align:start position:0%
Nursing whether or not that that's going
 
02:14:48.589 --> 02:14:48.599 align:start position:0%
to meet their eff efficienc needs
 
02:14:51.310 --> 02:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
because if the purpose of all of this is
 
02:14:53.189 --> 02:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
efficiency then we have to have a
 
02:14:55.030 --> 02:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
right-sized board as
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mani thank you um I just
 
02:15:07.589 --> 02:15:07.599 align:start position:0%
have a question for you um I can ask
 
02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
this is the right person to ask my
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
previous question correct Madam Cher no
 
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
no okay I'll defer she's she's a member
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
of the nurses Professional Association
 
02:15:22.109 --> 02:15:22.119 align:start position:0%
right um Samantha O'Neal is here for
 
02:15:24.709 --> 02:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
this board of
 
02:15:24.719 --> 02:15:26.270 align:start position:0%
this board of
nursing

02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
minutes good morning and thank you um my
 
02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
name is Samantha O'Neal and I'm the
 
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
public member and chair of the Board of
 
02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
Nursing I've been on the board of
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
nursing since September
 
02:15:47.109 --> 02:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
2017 um I do have a four-page um
 
02:15:48.910 --> 02:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
testimony that has been given out I
 
02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
don't plan to read it um I think the
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
best use of the time would be uh for me
 
02:15:55.790 --> 02:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
to highlight some specifics and then
 
02:15:57.669 --> 02:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
answer uh some of the questions that
 
02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
have come up that I think were posed to
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
other people but were meant uh for
 
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
me so um the board oversees um advanced
 
02:16:08.229 --> 02:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
practice nurses registered nurses
 
02:16:10.709 --> 02:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
nursing instructors licensed practical
 
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
nurses licensed nursing assistant and
 
02:16:15.310 --> 02:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
medical nursing assistant we have just
 
02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
shy of 50,000 lenes the number of lnas
 
02:16:21.149 --> 02:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
in the state currently are
 
02:16:24.669 --> 02:16:24.679 align:start position:0%
12,000 um and approximately 1,000 of
 
02:16:27.030 --> 02:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
them are medical nursing assistants you
 
02:16:31.470 --> 02:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
need um an LNA to be an m&amp;a so you need
 
02:16:34.349 --> 02:16:34.359 align:start position:0%
to have that license prior to being a a
 
02:16:36.190 --> 02:16:36.200 align:start position:0%
medical nurse assistant which allows you
 
02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
to dispense medications which is a huge
 
02:16:41.709 --> 02:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
component in our long-term care and uh
 
02:16:44.669 --> 02:16:44.679 align:start position:0%
facilities and our nursing homes um we
 
02:16:46.709 --> 02:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
currently do not have certified nursing
 
02:16:49.629 --> 02:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
assistants which was a your question was
 
02:16:52.509 --> 02:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
um we do have a lot of the um a lot of
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
my testimony on behalf of the board um
 
02:16:59.030 --> 02:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
has been stated previously by um uh
 
02:17:03.150 --> 02:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
speakers that came before me um we do we
 
02:17:06.509 --> 02:17:06.519 align:start position:0%
do have concerns um representative Gould
 
02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh we have concerns about the background
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
checks as well um as a note
 
02:17:15.669 --> 02:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
81% of all LNA applications come before
 
02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
the board due to background check
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
um there are many that do get their
 
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
license but many of them have to come
 
02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
before the board um to speak about their
 
02:17:27.070 --> 02:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
background so we can have an
 
02:17:28.830 --> 02:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
understanding of what happened and what
 
02:17:32.309 --> 02:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
they have in place uh for them to be uh
 
02:17:34.750 --> 02:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
act practicing uh actively within the
 
02:17:37.230 --> 02:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
community because lnas they're in the
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals but they're also home care
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
home uh and also long-term care and
 
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
that's where our most vulnerable
 
02:17:46.669 --> 02:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
patients are and we want to make sure
 
02:17:48.270 --> 02:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
and we have had people people before us
 
02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
for the board for theft um and taking
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
advantage of um people in in home care
 
02:17:56.429 --> 02:17:56.439 align:start position:0%
and also long-term care facilities so we
 
02:17:59.150 --> 02:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that they have clean
 
02:18:01.230 --> 02:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
background checks to make sure that they
 
02:18:03.669 --> 02:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
um are safe for our
 
02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
citizens um excuse me you said that 81%
 
02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
of the applicants have something on
 
02:18:11.190 --> 02:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
their background check that has to go to
 
02:18:12.629 --> 02:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
the board
 
02:18:14.990 --> 02:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
correct thank you for that information
 
02:18:18.270 --> 02:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
you're welcome and also 39%
 
02:18:19.870 --> 02:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
of the complaints that come before the
 
02:18:22.429 --> 02:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
board are for
 
02:18:22.439 --> 02:18:28.629 align:start position:0%
board are for
lnas

02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
39% um there was someone who asked I
 
02:18:33.950 --> 02:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
believe it was representative Schmidt um
 
02:18:36.270 --> 02:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
regarding how would the change impact
 
02:18:38.589 --> 02:18:38.599 align:start position:0%
the lnas it would depend on what the
 
02:18:41.230 --> 02:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
change is um I think you know from a
 
02:18:44.349 --> 02:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
board perspective we understand that
 
02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
there's challenges with the workforce we
 
02:18:49.030 --> 02:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
face it every day um I am a human
 
02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
resource professional I worked eight
 
02:18:53.190 --> 02:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
years in healthcare I currently don't
 
02:18:56.070 --> 02:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
work in healthcare right now um so I
 
02:18:57.870 --> 02:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
understand firsthand the challenges with
 
02:19:00.750 --> 02:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce and we we obviously have made
 
02:19:03.549 --> 02:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
changes on streamlining the process for
 
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
lenses making it easier um and but also
 
02:19:08.790 --> 02:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
making sure there's a balance between
 
02:19:11.790 --> 02:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
streamlining the process and also making
 
02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
sure that the people are safe to
 
02:19:16.349 --> 02:19:16.359 align:start position:0%
practice and they have the skills needed
 
02:19:18.110 --> 02:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
to practice to take care of patients and
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
there's a balance there and I think you
 
02:19:22.709 --> 02:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
know the board feels very strongly that
 
02:19:24.750 --> 02:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
we would be willing to have
 
02:19:27.030 --> 02:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
conversations with any of of this
 
02:19:29.389 --> 02:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
committee also the New Hampshire Nurses
 
02:19:32.309 --> 02:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
Association and any other um individual
 
02:19:34.349 --> 02:19:34.359 align:start position:0%
from the constituents that would be able
 
02:19:37.509 --> 02:19:37.519 align:start position:0%
to work collaboratively to come up with
 
02:19:39.950 --> 02:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
um a solution to this to be able to make
 
02:19:42.190 --> 02:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
sure that we're meeting the needs of the
 
02:19:44.349 --> 02:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
workforce while also making sure that
 
02:19:46.110 --> 02:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
those in the workforce are practicing
 
02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
safely and not cutting Corners to make
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
sure that we have people to do that we
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're having the
 
02:19:54.590 --> 02:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
right people do that and I think you
 
02:19:56.230 --> 02:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
know one of the missions of the Board of
 
02:19:58.110 --> 02:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
Nursing is making sure that people are
 
02:19:59.670 --> 02:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
safe to practice and make sure the
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
members of our community are safe and
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
that is the most important for us as I'm
 
02:20:06.270 --> 02:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
sure it is for all of
 
02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative man py
 
02:20:12.750 --> 02:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for that
 
02:20:15.070 --> 02:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
clarification so now my qu you know
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
having done a non-medical inhome care
 
02:20:19.870 --> 02:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
coordination and starting something in
 
02:20:23.790 --> 02:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh in my previous life but
 
02:20:27.910 --> 02:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
um with that where does the home health
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
aid fit in with the LNA CNA if we don't
 
02:20:36.309 --> 02:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
have CNA so are they taking the place
 
02:20:39.150 --> 02:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
especially for in home care so there's
 
02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
different positions for Home Care the
 
02:20:44.270 --> 02:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
those that are not licensed do not fall
 
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
under the preview of The Board of
 
02:20:48.630 --> 02:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
Nursing so I honestly don't know how
 
02:20:52.110 --> 02:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
many are providing home care but they
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
they can't work they cannot do the work
 
02:20:57.110 --> 02:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
of a licens nursing assistant so people
 
02:20:59.630 --> 02:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
can't practice outside of their specific
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
scope that's relevant to their license
 
02:21:04.110 --> 02:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
and if somebody is not licensed they
 
02:21:06.510 --> 02:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
should not be doing things that are
 
02:21:10.030 --> 02:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
licensed thank
 
02:21:14.830 --> 02:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
you yes um I'd also like to speak about
 
02:21:16.590 --> 02:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
the composition of the board thank you
 
02:21:19.870 --> 02:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's a big piece for us um so
 
02:21:21.870 --> 02:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
the board is made up of a cross
 
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
functional group of people um and in TW
 
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
we currently have we were just approved
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
in 2023 to increase our number from 11
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
to 13 um which was just done not even a
 
02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
year ago um we have a cross
 
02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
representation of
 
02:21:41.070 --> 02:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
aprns um we have two public members we
 
02:21:45.710 --> 02:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
have lnas RN's and lpn's all of which
 
02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
have different experience so we have
 
02:21:49.389 --> 02:21:49.399 align:start position:0%
people that have home care experience
 
02:21:52.590 --> 02:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
long-term care experience ambulatory
 
02:21:55.710 --> 02:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
hospital and we have all of those
 
02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
different lenses of which again are
 
02:22:00.389 --> 02:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
close to 50,000 come before the board
 
02:22:02.830 --> 02:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons and tapping
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
into that expertise and knowledge of
 
02:22:08.070 --> 02:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
that cross functional group of people is
 
02:22:11.190 --> 02:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
really Paramount to making sure that we
 
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
are one understanding best practices
 
02:22:16.230 --> 02:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
understanding the situation of whatever
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
is coming before us and we tap into that
 
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
level of expertise every single board
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
meeting uh to make sure that we are
 
02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
making sound decisions because the
 
02:22:28.349 --> 02:22:28.359 align:start position:0%
decisions we're making are not just
 
02:22:31.309 --> 02:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
impacting somebody's position their
 
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
their livelihood their license can
 
02:22:36.030 --> 02:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
depend on what they've done versus our
 
02:22:38.110 --> 02:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
decision on what to do for them moving
 
02:22:40.110 --> 02:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
forward so having that level of
 
02:22:42.830 --> 02:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
expertise is Paramount and decreasing
 
02:22:45.790 --> 02:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
that number is is we we honestly don't
 
02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
support that and feel that it's going
 
02:22:50.270 --> 02:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
going to have a negative impact on um on
 
02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
our decision making thank you does the
 
02:22:55.550 --> 02:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing have any trouble
 
02:22:58.429 --> 02:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
getting a quorum we do not not at all
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
even in our emergency situations we do
 
02:23:03.389 --> 02:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
not have a problem uh coming up with the
 
02:23:06.590 --> 02:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
Quorum at all thank
 
02:23:10.429 --> 02:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
you thank you represent
 
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
BR I wanted to
 
02:23:17.950 --> 02:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
um ask you to share with the board
 
02:23:20.590 --> 02:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
what an m&amp; does because it's very
 
02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
important what their responsibilities
 
02:23:24.309 --> 02:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
are as far as
 
02:23:26.469 --> 02:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
medication and the kind of training that
 
02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
they get and that this these this is the
 
02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
kind of work that's available for an LNA
 
02:23:34.269 --> 02:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
if they wish to um excuse me
 
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative gr I it's fascinating but
 
02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
I kind of think that belongs in the
 
02:23:41.349 --> 02:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would you agree oh okay
 
02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
thanks could I just comment I won't
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
answer specifically but you brought
 
02:23:46.910 --> 02:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
something up that I think is important
 
02:23:51.230 --> 02:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
is is a lot of the the LNA the m&amp; the RN
 
02:23:53.870 --> 02:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
the LPN those are all career advancement
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people in the in the
 
02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
nursing practice so you know when you
 
02:24:02.110 --> 02:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
look at the the scope it would be LNA m&amp;
 
02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
LPN RN APRN so th there is a direct
 
02:24:09.309 --> 02:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
career opportunity and growth path for
 
02:24:11.389 --> 02:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
people that do need various levels of
 
02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
experience to help them in their
 
02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
advancement of of care um and Licensing
 
02:24:18.910 --> 02:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
within the the workforce and the the
 
02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:21.630 align:start position:0%

professions in the state of New
 
02:25:37.269 --> 02:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are committed to the
 
02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
advancement of education and
 
02:25:41.070 --> 02:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
professional status of credential
 
02:25:43.389 --> 02:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
technologist I'm here today asking on
 
02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
their behalf as well as mine that this
 
02:25:48.510 --> 02:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
committee vote HB be 1410 in expedient
 
02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:50.550 align:start position:0%
committee vote HB be 1410 in expedient
to

02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:25:54.349 --> 02:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
legislate the biggest issue that Medical
 
02:25:57.230 --> 02:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
Imaging faces is this going away which
 
02:26:00.190 --> 02:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
will increase unsafe practice for the
 
02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
patient and not only for the patient but
 
02:26:05.349 --> 02:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
for the practitioner as
 
02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
well the patient rarely is in a position
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
to judge the qualifications of the
 
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
operator or the quality of the
 
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
examination let alone their radiation
 
02:26:19.429 --> 02:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
dosage the chest x-ray when performed by
 
02:26:21.950 --> 02:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
an uneducated untrained operator has the
 
02:26:24.429 --> 02:26:24.439 align:start position:0%
potential to deliver 100 times the
 
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
radiation dose to the patient as the
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
same procedure performed by a properly
 
02:26:32.110 --> 02:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
educated radiologic
 
02:26:36.030 --> 02:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
technologist education knowledge is the
 
02:26:40.110 --> 02:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
Paramount for safety for our patients
 
02:26:42.830 --> 02:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
and that's really what we need if we
 
02:26:45.990 --> 02:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
take away lure then we're taking away
 
02:26:48.030 --> 02:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
that level of over oversight and safety
 
02:26:50.110 --> 02:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
for our patients and for the people that
 
02:26:51.630 --> 02:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
are working in the
 
02:26:53.349 --> 02:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
industry if you don't know how to
 
02:26:55.670 --> 02:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
operate the equipment or to expose it
 
02:26:57.630 --> 02:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
properly then you're going to expose
 
02:27:00.070 --> 02:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
yourself to unsafe radiation levels just
 
02:27:02.510 --> 02:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
as you would to the
 
02:27:04.590 --> 02:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
patient the New Hampshire Hospital
 
02:27:07.230 --> 02:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
Association um was asked a question
 
02:27:09.750 --> 02:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
about what the majority of the United
 
02:27:13.269 --> 02:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
States are in regards to lure and over
 
02:27:16.990 --> 02:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
45 states have some form of lure in
 
02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.190 align:start position:0%
45 states have some form of lure in
their

02:27:19.190 --> 02:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:27:21.990 --> 02:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
state um happy to answer any questions
 
02:27:25.150 --> 02:27:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:27.510 --> 02:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
has representative
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair so you
 
02:27:32.070 --> 02:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
understand that this uh this bill
 
02:27:34.510 --> 02:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
involves a lot more than your profession
 
02:27:37.950 --> 02:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
so the idea of of itl doesn't really
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
resolve the issues that this bill you
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
know tries to deal with so um would you
 
02:27:48.990 --> 02:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
be a you know open to alternatives to an
 
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
itl motion sure I would love if you
 
02:27:54.269 --> 02:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
would strike us from the bill that would
 
02:27:56.830 --> 02:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
be great thank you that's nice and
 
02:28:00.630 --> 02:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
simple we will consider it I I I was not
 
02:28:02.550 --> 02:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
asked to ask that question but it's an
 
02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
obvious one all right thank
 
02:28:08.269 --> 02:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your
 
02:28:10.750 --> 02:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
testimony all right and I have four
 
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
students I hope that you will be brief
 
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
and not and not repeat what's been said
 
02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
white good morning uh Madam chair and
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
committee I have a written testimony
 
02:28:31.950 --> 02:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
from Dr sprag the chief radiologist at
 
02:28:37.429 --> 02:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:41.070 --> 02:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
record you can put it into the record we
 
02:28:43.190 --> 02:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
do you have copies for us or just one it
 
02:28:46.349 --> 02:28:46.359 align:start position:0%
is in bry's packet the packet that was
 
02:28:49.309 --> 02:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
up prior we will be reading reading this
 
02:28:51.269 --> 02:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
if you could give us the highlights we
 
02:28:54.030 --> 02:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
would appreciate absolutely uh Dr sprag
 
02:28:56.990 --> 02:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
agrees with the New Hampshire Society of
 
02:28:59.710 --> 02:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
radiologic technologists the American
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
registry of radiologic technologists and
 
02:29:05.110 --> 02:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
the American Society of radiologic
 
02:29:07.710 --> 02:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
technologists that removing lens here in
 
02:29:09.790 --> 02:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does create a safety
 
02:29:13.030 --> 02:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
hazard for both uh patients and uh
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
employees operating the medical imaging
 
02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:17.950 align:start position:0%
employees operating the medical imaging
equipment

02:29:17.950 --> 02:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
um as a radiologic technologist we spend
 
02:29:23.710 --> 02:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
at least two years in school most of us
 
02:29:25.550 --> 02:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
it ends up being about four by the time
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
we're done learning uh Anatomy
 
02:29:31.950 --> 02:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
physiology radio radiation physics uh
 
02:29:35.269 --> 02:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
patient and Personnel safety and without
 
02:29:36.830 --> 02:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
that you could really be putting a lot
 
02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
of people at risk of overdosing
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
radiation and
 
02:29:44.469 --> 02:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh for instance injecting an air bow
 
02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
list through uh CT injector or
 
02:29:51.950 --> 02:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
aspirating barium if Pro improperly
 
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
given to a
 
02:29:57.230 --> 02:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
patient thank you that's very clear
 
02:30:00.429 --> 02:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
question all right thank you very much
 
02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative Brown uh thank you
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair so following up what I asked
 
02:30:09.309 --> 02:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
before you see that if this passes it
 
02:30:11.429 --> 02:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
will change the amount of education
 
02:30:13.309 --> 02:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
required and therefore that's a safety
 
02:30:16.070 --> 02:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
issue yeah actually Dr sprag did mention
 
02:30:17.710 --> 02:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
that yeah I'm trying to read this I'm
 
02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
sorry I apologize continue okay uh he
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
did mention that hospitals would no
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
longer be required to hire license
 
02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
technologist which could leave a lot of
 
02:30:28.269 --> 02:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
gray area and what kind of education is
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
required for the job okay okay fair
 
02:30:34.469 --> 02:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
enough thank you very much thank
 
02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:45.439 --> 02:30:48.870 align:start position:0%
 
Horton

02:30:48.870 --> 02:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:51.910 --> 02:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Jessica Horton
 
02:30:54.110 --> 02:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
and I am a registered radiologic
 
02:30:55.550 --> 02:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
technologist for the State of New
 
02:30:58.630 --> 02:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um I am also one of the
 
02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
two program directors for uh two of the
 
02:31:03.070 --> 02:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
accredited radiologic technology
 
02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
programs in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
so just to summarize um I also I'm on
 
02:31:11.150 --> 02:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
the state the New Hampshire Society of
 
02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
radiologic technologist board so I am an
 
02:31:15.230 --> 02:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
advocate and an educator and a
 
02:31:17.309 --> 02:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
practicing radiologic technologist on a
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
perdm basis primarily my role is to
 
02:31:21.750 --> 02:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
educate students in the state of New
 
02:31:24.550 --> 02:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um to go out and serve our
 
02:31:27.750 --> 02:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
communities and in that role one of the
 
02:31:29.190 --> 02:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
most important aspects of their
 
02:31:32.269 --> 02:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
education is learning human anatomy and
 
02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
physiology proper radiographic
 
02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
positioning and radiation protection so
 
02:31:39.469 --> 02:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
Brandy custen came up here earlier and
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned um the importance of proper
 
02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
positioning regarding any sort of
 
02:31:48.230 --> 02:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
Imaging modality that is performed and
 
02:31:50.750 --> 02:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
without proper positioning and radiation
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
protection uh basically an individual
 
02:31:54.950 --> 02:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
that would be performing any sort of
 
02:31:57.950 --> 02:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
Medical Imaging study would be guessing
 
02:32:00.269 --> 02:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
how to perform that study so I'm asking
 
02:32:04.510 --> 02:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
you to please consider uh my strong
 
02:32:08.469 --> 02:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill because the fact

sure excellent
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony thank

02:32:51.389 --> 02:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
tonium thank you for allowing me to
 
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
speak today um I just wanted to voice my
 
02:32:58.750 --> 02:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
concerns to this bill due to patient
 
02:33:01.309 --> 02:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
safety um whenever you're a patient in a
 
02:33:03.230 --> 02:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
hospital you expect that you were going
 
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
to receive Quality Care by
 
02:33:07.990 --> 02:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
individuals that are well capable of
 
02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
doing their job and especially with um
 
02:33:13.870 --> 02:33:13.880 align:start position:0%
radiation safety I'm currently a senior
 
02:33:16.469 --> 02:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
student and there's been a lot of
 
02:33:19.830 --> 02:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
learning curves and different aspects
 
02:33:23.110 --> 02:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
that go into this and whenever you go in
 
02:33:25.710 --> 02:33:25.720 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have properly trained staff
 
02:33:29.230 --> 02:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
members that are capable of knowing what
 
02:33:32.349 --> 02:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
what they are uh doing this could cause
 
02:33:36.030 --> 02:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
many safety concerns It Could lack the
 
02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
quality of care it could endanger the
 
02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
patient along with yourself
 
02:33:46.429 --> 02:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
um and with that being said it is is
 
02:33:48.190 --> 02:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
rather dangerous to have people that
 
02:33:50.269 --> 02:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
could slip through the cracks without
 
02:33:55.389 --> 02:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
this lure in place and cause uh harm to
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
our community as a whole when Medical
 
02:34:00.990 --> 02:34:01.000 align:start position:0%

02:34:26.469 --> 02:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
good morning um I'm bre RN and I'm here
 
02:34:29.950 --> 02:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
to speak on the behalf of the Imaging
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
programs um I just want to bring up the
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
fact that um getting an x-ray is a
 
02:34:38.590 --> 02:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
prescription um you're prescribed an
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
x-ray you're press red the dosage of
 
02:34:44.670 --> 02:34:44.680 align:start position:0%
what it takes to get the proper image um
 
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
without a properly training in person
 
02:34:50.110 --> 02:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
how do they know what dosage um each
 
02:34:52.309 --> 02:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
machine you kind of learn so each
 
02:34:54.630 --> 02:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
machine at every facility you got to
 
02:34:56.950 --> 02:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
learn a little bit to tweak it so you're
 
02:34:59.389 --> 02:34:59.399 align:start position:0%
given a proper
 
02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
dosage that's all I really have to say
 
02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for coming to talk to us
 
02:35:09.269 --> 02:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
today questions okay thank you very
 
02:35:14.990 --> 02:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:28.670 align:start position:0%
 
Sherman

02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um and thank you
 
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak on this
 
02:35:36.429 --> 02:35:36.439 align:start position:0%
bill uh for the record my name is Tom
 
02:35:39.510 --> 02:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
Sherman former State Rep state senator
 
02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:47.550 --> 02:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
gastroenterologist um from Ry um I'd
 
02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
like to speak to two parts of the bill
 
02:35:52.630 --> 02:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
um I think the nursing uh rules have
 
02:35:54.590 --> 02:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
been covered by people much more expert
 
02:35:59.190 --> 02:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
than I um but on page six lines 22
 
02:36:01.990 --> 02:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
through 26 I would ask that you strike
 
02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:02.990 align:start position:0%
through 26 I would ask that you strike
this

02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:36:06.750 --> 02:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
repeal um last year I believe we had a a
 
02:36:09.670 --> 02:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
repeal of the Medtech board before you
 
02:36:12.309 --> 02:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
and I spoke at length about the history
 
02:36:15.389 --> 02:36:15.399 align:start position:0%
of the Medtech board a be a brief
 
02:36:18.790 --> 02:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
reminder years in 2011 my work partner
 
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
and I discovered a hepatitis C outbreak
 
02:36:25.429 --> 02:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
at exitor hospital 32 patients were
 
02:36:28.590 --> 02:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
involved Senator Cataldo's mother was
 
02:36:31.230 --> 02:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
one of the victims that died of that the
 
02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
bills that came out of that at least
 
02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
four made New Hampshire one of the
 
02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
safest states in the country against
 
02:36:41.950 --> 02:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
drug diversion and the um criminal who
 
02:36:45.630 --> 02:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
actually did that was a radiology tech
 
02:36:48.950 --> 02:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
in in um and there was no
 
02:36:54.269 --> 02:36:54.279 align:start position:0%
mechanism to actually track him so U
 
02:36:56.230 --> 02:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative Copeland and I came
 
02:36:58.150 --> 02:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
together representative Copeland is a
 
02:37:01.150 --> 02:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
republican we came together and we took
 
02:37:03.190 --> 02:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
a bill that already existed which was
 
02:37:05.150 --> 02:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
the bill to create the board of medical
 
02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
technicians the board of registry and
 
02:37:10.309 --> 02:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
worked on it in a bipartisan fashion for
 
02:37:13.269 --> 02:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
over a year to come up with the Medtech
 
02:37:16.150 --> 02:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
board the goal of the board and this is
 
02:37:17.750 --> 02:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
what's critically important the goal of
 
02:37:22.269 --> 02:37:22.279 align:start position:0%
the B board was to close a gap in state
 
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
monitoring of people who have access to
 
02:37:28.910 --> 02:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
patients and dangerous drugs like
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
opioids that was the goal of the board
 
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
so if you are a medical assistant you're
 
02:37:37.590 --> 02:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
not licensed or registered or otherwise
 
02:37:40.349 --> 02:37:40.359 align:start position:0%
classified anywhere in New Hampshire and
 
02:37:43.630 --> 02:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
that's still true unless you have access
 
02:37:46.710 --> 02:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
to patients and controlled sub
 
02:37:49.630 --> 02:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
substances then you have to register
 
02:37:52.230 --> 02:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
with the board of medical
 
02:37:55.950 --> 02:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
technicians is this a decade later the
 
02:37:59.070 --> 02:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
best way to handle this to close that
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
Gap I'm not sure but I think the fact
 
02:38:04.030 --> 02:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
that we have not had any further
 
02:38:06.790 --> 02:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
outbreaks in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:38:09.750 --> 02:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
may be a testimony to this is at least a
 
02:38:12.870 --> 02:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
smart way to do it but as director
 
02:38:14.510 --> 02:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
Courtney has said they have trouble
 
02:38:16.630 --> 02:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
Staffing the board and may be another
 
02:38:20.389 --> 02:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
alternative to it but repealing it all
 
02:38:23.349 --> 02:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
together reopens that
 
02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
Gap according to the federal attorney
 
02:38:30.510 --> 02:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
who prosecuted katowski in that case
 
02:38:34.710 --> 02:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
8,500 people were put at risk nationally
 
02:38:38.190 --> 02:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
by one person and his final stop was at
 
02:38:41.070 --> 02:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
exor in exor New Hampshire and we
 
02:38:42.870 --> 02:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
stopped him in New
 
02:38:45.750 --> 02:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it was the third largest
 
02:38:47.389 --> 02:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
hepatitis C outbreak due to drug
 
02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
diversion in the country and many people
 
02:38:54.269 --> 02:38:54.279 align:start position:0%
got sick many people died and most of
 
02:38:55.950 --> 02:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
them were elderly because it happened in
 
02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
the cath
 
02:39:02.550 --> 02:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
lab so I would ask that you not repeal I
 
02:39:04.429 --> 02:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
would commit to working with director
 
02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
Courtney to some other less cumbersome
 
02:39:11.630 --> 02:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
more efficient way of monitoring people
 
02:39:14.030 --> 02:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
this is not a clinical evaluation of
 
02:39:16.429 --> 02:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
people's performance it's simply a way
 
02:39:19.950 --> 02:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that if there is somebody
 
02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire in this
 
02:39:25.230 --> 02:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
position which I've already defined that
 
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
we know about them and we also know if
 
02:39:31.230 --> 02:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
there's a disciplinary action or even a
 
02:39:34.950 --> 02:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
criminal criminal uh prosecution of
 
02:39:38.910 --> 02:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
them uh I that would keep the Gap closed
 
02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:39.630 align:start position:0%
them uh I that would keep the Gap closed
the

02:39:39.630 --> 02:39:39.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
second part that I want to speak on is
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
the repeal of the board of radiology
 
02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
technicians this bill this board was
 
02:39:52.190 --> 02:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
created by Senator Carson who is chair
 
02:39:55.590 --> 02:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
of Edna on the Senate side not anymore
 
02:39:59.230 --> 02:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
not anymore but I I'm old I've been she
 
02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
was when I was here lots of expertise on
 
02:40:06.070 --> 02:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
the boards coming from Senator Carson
 
02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
but the most important part was one of
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
the pieces of testimony that happened
 
02:40:13.389 --> 02:40:13.399 align:start position:0%
during the formation of this board which
 
02:40:16.469 --> 02:40:16.479 align:start position:0%
wowed the committee at the time
 
02:40:19.389 --> 02:40:19.399 align:start position:0%
and that was when somebody said that in
 
02:40:23.950 --> 02:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
a dental office the receptionist did the
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh actual
 
02:40:29.710 --> 02:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
X-rays and when and it was somebody who
 
02:40:32.429 --> 02:40:32.439 align:start position:0%
was on the committee in the
 
02:40:35.349 --> 02:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
house and the radiology tech who was
 
02:40:37.830 --> 02:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
actually testifying at the time said did
 
02:40:39.389 --> 02:40:39.399 align:start position:0%
they Shield
 
02:40:43.150 --> 02:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.349 --> 02:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
no the gentleman's face went
 
02:40:49.710 --> 02:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
white that's what we're going back to
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're going back to receptionists being
 
02:40:55.790 --> 02:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
able to perform potentially dangerous
 
02:40:58.469 --> 02:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
procedures because they don't know they
 
02:41:00.269 --> 02:41:00.279 align:start position:0%
don't have the education they don't have
 
02:41:00.279 --> 02:41:01.269 align:start position:0%
don't have the education they don't have
the

02:41:01.269 --> 02:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:41:04.510 --> 02:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
certification that this board provides
 
02:41:08.349 --> 02:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
in how they actually dose the radiation
 
02:41:10.269 --> 02:41:10.279 align:start position:0%
how they protect the patient and
 
02:41:12.030 --> 02:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
themselves from the
 
02:41:16.030 --> 02:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
radiation um so I would ask you to give
 
02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
us a chance to close that Gap in another
 
02:41:20.670 --> 02:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
way if there are problems with the board
 
02:41:23.269 --> 02:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
of medical technicians rather than a
 
02:41:26.910 --> 02:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
repeal and uh the second one is please
 
02:41:30.389 --> 02:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
leave the radiology tech board intact
 
02:41:33.429 --> 02:41:33.439 align:start position:0%
it's critical and it will be life saving
 
02:41:35.030 --> 02:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm happy to take any
 
02:41:37.429 --> 02:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
02:41:41.630 --> 02:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
you just a brief one representative
 
02:41:44.429 --> 02:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
manuti thank you I haven't even turned
 
02:41:44.439 --> 02:41:46.349 align:start position:0%
manuti thank you I haven't even turned
my

02:41:46.349 --> 02:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:41:50.110 --> 02:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
microphone off sorry so how will this
 
02:41:54.710 --> 02:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
rule change affect the larger sector
 
02:41:58.790 --> 02:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
where Home Care Aging in place outside
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
the hospital kind of thing so the
 
02:42:05.429 --> 02:42:05.439 align:start position:0%
oversight on that critical function that
 
02:42:09.670 --> 02:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
LNA the technicians all provide will
 
02:42:13.550 --> 02:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
this Reduce by repealing this will that
 
02:42:16.630 --> 02:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
reduce the oversight you know honestly I
 
02:42:18.349 --> 02:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
think you've had people who are much
 
02:42:21.870 --> 02:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
more expert already speak to that and
 
02:42:24.269 --> 02:42:24.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm just a simple Country Doctor I'm
 
02:42:28.190 --> 02:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
not a nurse so um I wouldn't I think
 
02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
you've had the experts already talk
 
02:42:33.790 --> 02:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
about that if that's okay no that's we'd
 
02:42:36.750 --> 02:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
rather you didn't uh waffle for a bit
 
02:42:39.230 --> 02:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
we're all right oh I'm not waffling
 
02:42:41.469 --> 02:42:41.479 align:start position:0%
Madam chair thank thank you very much I
 
02:42:43.950 --> 02:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that all right we have
 
02:42:46.469 --> 02:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
another hearing at
 
02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
115 uh unless there is someone who needs
 
02:42:54.429 --> 02:42:54.439 align:start position:0%
to speak on this bill now is there okay
 
02:42:56.550 --> 02:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for being here we
 
02:42:59.870 --> 02:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
will take that information to the
 
02:43:04.190 --> 02:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I'm going to close the
 
02:43:07.230 --> 02:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
hearing for the purposes of the
 
02:43:10.349 --> 02:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
committee we will not have a session
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
next Thursday we will have u a full day
 
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:44.269 --> 02:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:44.279 --> 03:14:24.030 align:start position:0%
 
25th

03:14:24.030 --> 03:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:26.990 --> 03:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
a regulation and lure of Deputy
 
03:14:29.950 --> 03:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
Physicians and um representative Brian
 
03:14:41.469 --> 03:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:41.479 --> 03:14:43.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:14:43.469 --> 03:14:43.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:14:45.309 --> 03:14:45.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:14:48.870 --> 03:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
members uh 1427 is establishing the
 
03:14:52.070 --> 03:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
regulation and licensure of Deputy
 
03:14:55.469 --> 03:14:55.479 align:start position:0%
Physicians so this is a bill that has
 
03:14:57.870 --> 03:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
come up in the past but there was always
 
03:14:57.880 --> 03:14:58.710 align:start position:0%
come up in the past but there was always
a

03:14:58.710 --> 03:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:15:02.030 --> 03:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
problem with the the verbage of the
 
03:15:04.070 --> 03:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
title they wanted to call it assistant
 
03:15:06.150 --> 03:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
position or phys assistant so you can
 
03:15:07.670 --> 03:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
see where that's very confusing between
 
03:15:10.790 --> 03:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
the two so it changed the language to
 
03:15:13.870 --> 03:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
Deputy physician to make the distinction
 
03:15:15.190 --> 03:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the first major
 
03:15:17.389 --> 03:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
distinctions that's in this
 
03:15:19.990 --> 03:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill now why are we asking you know why
 
03:15:21.110 --> 03:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
are we bringing this bill to the
 
03:15:23.590 --> 03:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
committee in for New Hampshire currently
 
03:15:26.030 --> 03:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's about 5,000 people in the United
 
03:15:28.189 --> 03:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
States that have all the qualifications
 
03:15:30.670 --> 03:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
to become a doctor but they can't find
 
03:15:32.510 --> 03:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
the residency to do
 
03:15:35.389 --> 03:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
so so they passed all their tests they
 
03:15:37.790 --> 03:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
pass all them exams the last thing they
 
03:15:40.389 --> 03:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
need to do is to follow or Shadow
 
03:15:42.870 --> 03:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
somebody in the medical community key to
 
03:15:44.229 --> 03:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
get that
 
03:15:46.550 --> 03:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
residency what this bill does is allow
 
03:15:49.429 --> 03:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
that door to open up for New Hampshire
 
03:15:51.309 --> 03:15:51.319 align:start position:0%
now there's already nine states in the
 
03:15:55.030 --> 03:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
state in the country that are enacted
 
03:15:56.750 --> 03:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
this and they're taking all that medical
 
03:15:58.870 --> 03:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
talent and bringing it to their states I
 
03:15:59.830 --> 03:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
think that's something that we can do
 
03:16:01.189 --> 03:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
here for New
 
03:16:03.590 --> 03:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that's a very brief
 
03:16:06.349 --> 03:16:06.359 align:start position:0%
overview of the bill all the technical
 
03:16:07.910 --> 03:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
stuff in all the rsas I'm sure you can
 
03:16:09.710 --> 03:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
look that up on your own and go through
 
03:16:12.710 --> 03:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
that technical data but that's the Crux
 
03:16:13.870 --> 03:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:16:17.830 --> 03:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
bill so I'll inate any questions I know
 
03:16:18.910 --> 03:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
it sounds kind of simple it's a
 
03:16:20.550 --> 03:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
complicated bill but I mean that's
 
03:16:21.950 --> 03:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
really what it's about great thank you
 
03:16:36.070 --> 03:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:38.790 --> 03:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
questions sure okay representative G
 
03:16:40.750 --> 03:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
thank you what do you mean they don't
 
03:16:43.910 --> 03:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
have availability of residency I don't
 
03:16:47.070 --> 03:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
understand residency I passed out I put
 
03:16:49.870 --> 03:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
a a thing on everybody's desk so there's
 
03:16:51.910 --> 03:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
an article related to this and then this
 
03:16:53.870 --> 03:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
testimony from Ross Terry who was a
 
03:16:58.510 --> 03:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
former rep he's also a um a
 
03:17:01.750 --> 03:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacist so residency you need to be
 
03:17:04.469 --> 03:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
matched up with a doctor and you Shadow
 
03:17:07.189 --> 03:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
this person for x amount of time and you
 
03:17:10.429 --> 03:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
learn how to you know become a doctor
 
03:17:11.750 --> 03:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's how you learn how to get your
 
03:17:14.070 --> 03:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
license to to practice medicine but
 
03:17:15.670 --> 03:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
there's only so much of that pairing in
 
03:17:16.670 --> 03:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
the United
 
03:17:19.389 --> 03:17:19.399 align:start position:0%
States in 2021 there was 4,000 people
 
03:17:21.389 --> 03:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
looking for residency this year it's
 
03:17:23.590 --> 03:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
5,000 people looking for residency so
 
03:17:26.189 --> 03:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
it's becoming more and more of a problem
 
03:17:27.950 --> 03:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
so it has to do more with
 
03:17:30.150 --> 03:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
pairing and opening up that Avenue
 
03:17:31.990 --> 03:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's only so much
 
03:17:34.349 --> 03:17:34.359 align:start position:0%
residency so these people can't find the
 
03:17:38.030 --> 03:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
residency to become a doctor follow
 
03:17:41.910 --> 03:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
up so residency is usually specific to a
 
03:17:41.920 --> 03:17:43.110 align:start position:0%
up so residency is usually specific to a
c

03:17:43.110 --> 03:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
c
 
03:17:45.510 --> 03:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
certain to a certain segment of the
 
03:17:47.269 --> 03:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
medical field for example you have
 
03:17:49.309 --> 03:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologists you have thorasic
 
03:17:52.750 --> 03:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
surgeons you have orthopedists so is
 
03:17:54.870 --> 03:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
there a specific residency that's not
 
03:17:57.150 --> 03:17:57.160 align:start position:0%
available to these individuals it's the
 
03:18:01.750 --> 03:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:04.030 --> 03:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
residency there's only so much residency
 
03:18:06.150 --> 03:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
available so if you make this residency
 
03:18:07.269 --> 03:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
available to somebody that is a
 
03:18:09.950 --> 03:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
specialist like that and they can Shadow
 
03:18:12.189 --> 03:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
two or three people they can open their
 
03:18:13.349 --> 03:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
residency that way they can ear The
 
03:18:16.110 --> 03:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:19.189 --> 03:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
way thank
 
03:18:21.429 --> 03:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
you representative Schmidt you do you
 
03:18:22.469 --> 03:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:18:27.550 --> 03:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
question well uh I know that residency
 
03:18:31.110 --> 03:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
to my knowledg is usually in involves a
 
03:18:35.309 --> 03:18:35.319 align:start position:0%
an affiliation with a with a teaching
 
03:18:38.309 --> 03:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
medical school so Dartmouth has Med
 
03:18:41.590 --> 03:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
medical school right but UNH does not
 
03:18:43.790 --> 03:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
have a medic medical school I believe I
 
03:18:46.349 --> 03:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
do not know I believe
 
03:18:46.359 --> 03:18:50.469 align:start position:0%
do not know I believe
so

03:18:50.469 --> 03:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:53.070 --> 03:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
um do we have anybody from Dartmouth
 
03:18:55.670 --> 03:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
here that you know can talk to us about
 
03:18:58.630 --> 03:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
this situation representative Cole you
 
03:19:01.710 --> 03:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
said there's only so many residents how
 
03:19:05.070 --> 03:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
many do you have the number for
 
03:19:09.590 --> 03:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
for medical school graduates versus
 
03:19:12.110 --> 03:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
residencies the number that I have are
 
03:19:13.429 --> 03:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
people that have passed all the
 
03:19:16.030 --> 03:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
qualifications federally to become a
 
03:19:18.429 --> 03:19:18.439 align:start position:0%
doctor they just need to earn they need
 
03:19:19.990 --> 03:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
to find a place to Res find that
 
03:19:21.870 --> 03:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
residency and right now there's
 
03:19:23.469 --> 03:19:23.479 align:start position:0%
currently about 5,000 people in the

introduce myself a little bit slowly uh
 
03:20:18.670 --> 03:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Ava Hawks and
 
03:20:20.070 --> 03:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
I am the director of advocacy for the

medical society strongly opposes House

Bill
 
03:20:28.630 --> 03:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
1427 um House Bill 1427 seeks to allow
 
03:20:30.630 --> 03:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
medical school graduates who do not have
 
03:20:33.630 --> 03:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
who have not completed graduate medic
 
03:20:35.750 --> 03:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
medical education or residency or
 
03:20:37.150 --> 03:20:37.160 align:start position:0%
completed the medical licensing

examination series a series that tests
 
03:20:41.150 --> 03:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
if future Doctors Medical knowledge and

called Deputy Physicians as this bill
 
03:20:48.910 --> 03:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
sets forth the provisions set forth in
 
03:20:50.389 --> 03:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
this bill would dramatically lower the
 
03:20:51.870 --> 03:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
standard of training and competency
 
03:20:53.630 --> 03:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
demonstration that our providers across
 
03:20:55.429 --> 03:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
Specialties and the state work so hard
 
03:20:57.429 --> 03:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
to implement and frankly the bill would
 
03:20:58.990 --> 03:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
unjustly risk patient safety in New
 
03:21:00.910 --> 03:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh the American Medical

specialty medical societies has also
 
03:21:10.309 --> 03:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
gone on the record opposing any efforts
 
03:21:12.510 --> 03:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
in states that create pathways for
 
03:21:15.229 --> 03:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
Deputy Physicians or previously coined
 
03:21:16.830 --> 03:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
as assistant physicians in proposed
 
03:21:18.950 --> 03:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
legislation in 2019 that was defeated as
 
03:21:21.389 --> 03:21:21.399 align:start position:0%
well um and these efforts to circumvent
 
03:21:22.910 --> 03:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
the traditional residency training and
 
03:21:25.150 --> 03:21:25.160 align:start position:0%
standards put forth by the accreditation

Council for graduate medical education
 
03:21:30.389 --> 03:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
program or acgme which you'll hear folks
 
03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
experts behind me speak to more uh
 
03:21:34.309 --> 03:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
eloquently today while the society's
 
03:21:36.150 --> 03:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
membership is acutely aware of the
 
03:21:37.870 --> 03:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
impact the current Healthcare Workforce
 
03:21:39.349 --> 03:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
shortage has on access to care in New
 
03:21:41.389 --> 03:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our state's Physicians and the
 
03:21:42.870 --> 03:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
medical profession as a whole are not
 
03:21:44.830 --> 03:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
willing to risk patient safety and
 
03:21:46.469 --> 03:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
health outcomes by licensing medical
 
03:21:48.830 --> 03:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
school graduates who lack the imperative
 
03:21:50.750 --> 03:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
and life-saving Skillets acquired during
 
03:21:52.349 --> 03:21:52.359 align:start position:0%
residency training all in the name of
 
03:21:54.910 --> 03:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
increased access to care um for these
 
03:21:56.389 --> 03:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
reasons the medical society joins
 
03:21:58.070 --> 03:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
countless other others including the New
 
03:21:59.710 --> 03:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of Medicine and strongly
 
03:22:02.349 --> 03:22:02.359 align:start position:0%
opposing House Bill 1427 and encourages
 
03:22:04.030 --> 03:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
the house Ena committee to recommend an
 
03:22:05.990 --> 03:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on this bill to
 
03:22:07.910 --> 03:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that we continue to prioritize
 
03:22:09.830 --> 03:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
not undervalue the medical education
 
03:22:11.229 --> 03:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
clinical training and high standards of
 
03:22:13.309 --> 03:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
our states pH positions that have led to
 
03:22:15.950 --> 03:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
our highquality healthare system I am
 
03:22:18.229 --> 03:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
happy to attempt to take questions but I
 
03:22:19.790 --> 03:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
know that there are a number of
 
03:22:21.349 --> 03:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
Physicians and experts behind me that
 
03:22:23.309 --> 03:22:23.319 align:start position:0%
will speak more eloquently to the
 
03:22:25.030 --> 03:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
intricacies that go into the residency
 
03:22:26.790 --> 03:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
programs in our state and what those
 
03:22:29.189 --> 03:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
those those programs look
 
03:22:32.950 --> 03:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
like okay Are there specific questions
 
03:22:36.389 --> 03:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
repes it's not required representative
 
03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
but go ahead and ask thank you madam
 
03:22:43.550 --> 03:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
03:22:45.830 --> 03:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
as you read this would a deputy
 
03:22:47.790 --> 03:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
physician working under a physician
 
03:22:49.750 --> 03:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
would that be similar to a
 
03:22:52.670 --> 03:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
residency and anyone following you can
 
03:22:54.229 --> 03:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
answer that question so I don't want to
 
03:22:56.710 --> 03:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
football but I think the providers and
 
03:22:58.229 --> 03:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
physicians in the room could really
 
03:22:59.710 --> 03:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
eloquently speak to the differences
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
between the process that's outlined in
 
03:23:04.349 --> 03:23:04.359 align:start position:0%
this bill in comparison to how these
 
03:23:06.670 --> 03:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
residency programs work in our state
 
03:23:06.680 --> 03:23:07.550 align:start position:0%
residency programs work in our state
thank

03:23:07.550 --> 03:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:23:13.590 --> 03:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
you all right representative Smith
 
03:23:16.150 --> 03:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me but how long are residency
 
03:23:19.429 --> 03:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
usually is it a year two years so it
 
03:23:21.269 --> 03:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
varies depending on the specialty on
 
03:23:23.309 --> 03:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
average it's anywhere from 3 to five as
 
03:23:25.189 --> 03:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
I understand it and there are some um
 
03:23:26.950 --> 03:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
surgical residencies that last longer
 
03:23:29.070 --> 03:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
than that and I I'm confident folks
 
03:23:31.070 --> 03:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
directly behind me who plan to testify
 
03:23:33.710 --> 03:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
can speak to their experiences they um
 
03:23:36.469 --> 03:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
have has have a a facilitated reset
 
03:23:38.030 --> 03:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
residency programs in our
 
03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
state okay let me think about that
 
03:23:59.790 --> 03:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:02.030 --> 03:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
Stoddard um good afternoon my name is
 
03:24:03.950 --> 03:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
Christine Stoddard and I'm the director
 
03:24:06.429 --> 03:24:06.439 align:start position:0%
of uh public policy at by state Primary
 
03:24:10.189 --> 03:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
Care Association we are also opposed by
 
03:24:11.910 --> 03:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
state Primary Care Association is a
 
03:24:15.070 --> 03:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
nonprofit that works to expand access to
 
03:24:18.110 --> 03:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
health care services in especially in
 
03:24:20.229 --> 03:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
medically underserved areas which is the
 
03:24:22.110 --> 03:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
areas of the state that this bill is
 
03:24:24.389 --> 03:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
targeting we also represent New
 
03:24:25.990 --> 03:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's community health centers
 
03:24:27.630 --> 03:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
which are regulated by the federal
 
03:24:30.110 --> 03:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
government and they operate in medically
 
03:24:33.030 --> 03:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
underserved areas our community health
 
03:24:35.870 --> 03:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
centers cannot employ the clinicians
 
03:24:39.510 --> 03:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill is proposing to create we
 
03:24:42.229 --> 03:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
rely on Federal malpractices Insurance
 
03:24:45.590 --> 03:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure our doctors and the safety of
 
03:24:47.910 --> 03:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
um patients in New Hampshire they would
 
03:24:50.830 --> 03:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
not cover um the clinicians that this
 
03:24:53.990 --> 03:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
bill is proposing to create we are also
 
03:24:57.950 --> 03:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
not able to get reimbursed for the care
 
03:25:00.750 --> 03:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
that would be provided under this bill
 
03:25:04.070 --> 03:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
um by any carrier especially CMS the
 
03:25:06.710 --> 03:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
centers for Medicaid and Medicare
 
03:25:09.750 --> 03:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
Services we do not have the ability to
 
03:25:12.670 --> 03:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
float Health Care Services provided by
 
03:25:15.269 --> 03:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
clinicians that we cannot get reimbursed
 
03:25:19.429 --> 03:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
for um so in summary we can't afford to
 
03:25:22.910 --> 03:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
employ this type of um clinician that
 
03:25:25.630 --> 03:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is proposing to create so we
 
03:25:28.790 --> 03:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
would ask that you recommend the bill be
 
03:25:32.550 --> 03:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate because we
 
03:25:35.510 --> 03:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
can't employ them we would rather create
 
03:25:38.349 --> 03:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
additional residency programs and more
 
03:25:40.550 --> 03:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
training opportunities for clinicians
 
03:25:44.189 --> 03:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
than reduce the requirements to practice
 
03:25:46.429 --> 03:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
medicine in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:25:48.349 --> 03:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions if
 
03:25:50.469 --> 03:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
you have them okay thank you
 
03:25:53.110 --> 03:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative Mani thank you madam
 
03:25:55.309 --> 03:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for your testimony and
 
03:25:57.670 --> 03:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question is it
 
03:26:00.510 --> 03:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
true that currently
 
03:26:04.309 --> 03:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
existing um residency
 
03:26:07.670 --> 03:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
programs uh for doctors you know who
 
03:26:10.950 --> 03:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
have they are not completely filled in
 
03:26:14.910 --> 03:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
some places because people are burnt out
 
03:26:17.790 --> 03:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
and don't want to get into medical field
 
03:26:18.870 --> 03:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:26:22.150 --> 03:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
practicing um doctors is that have you
 
03:26:24.630 --> 03:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
heard that thank you representative for
 
03:26:26.790 --> 03:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
the question I think that the workforce
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
shortages that we are experienc are very
 
03:26:31.269 --> 03:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
complicated there's not just one reason
 
03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
why PE why we are experiencing shortages
 
03:26:36.830 --> 03:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
but yes there is definitely burnout
 
03:26:39.150 --> 03:26:39.160 align:start position:0%
amongst medical professionals across the

03:26:47.910 --> 03:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative gold hi thank you uh
 
03:26:50.950 --> 03:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:26:53.150 --> 03:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question has to is
 
03:26:54.910 --> 03:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
a follow-up and it has to do with
 
03:26:57.110 --> 03:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
residencies and everything I've heard
 
03:26:58.349 --> 03:26:58.359 align:start position:0%
I've never experienced one but
 
03:27:00.229 --> 03:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
everything I've heard and read from
 
03:27:03.309 --> 03:27:03.319 align:start position:0%
doctors about residencies is that the
 
03:27:05.070 --> 03:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
way they're set up they are very
 
03:27:08.389 --> 03:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
unhealthy for the people enduring them
 
03:27:10.150 --> 03:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
do you have anything to do with how
 
03:27:12.189 --> 03:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
residencies are set up and as an
 
03:27:14.670 --> 03:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
alternative to this if we're going to um
 
03:27:17.750 --> 03:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
expand residencies can they be made more
 
03:27:20.910 --> 03:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
healthy for the people trying to do them
 
03:27:22.990 --> 03:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
I think that's beyond the scope of this
 
03:27:24.750 --> 03:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
bill to be honest with you
 
03:27:27.349 --> 03:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative go thank you I'll accept
 
03:27:30.229 --> 03:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
that there thank you you're you're not
 
03:27:32.229 --> 03:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
responsible for residency you just take
 
03:27:34.189 --> 03:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
the doctor we are not representative
 
03:27:36.429 --> 03:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
I'm all right any other
 
03:27:40.319 --> 03:27:42.150 align:start position:0%
I'm all right any other
questions

03:27:42.150 --> 03:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:27:46.229 --> 03:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:48.050 --> 03:27:48.060 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Nurses Association um like we
 
03:28:11.790 --> 03:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
did in 2019 opposes this bill
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
um we recognize there's a need for
 
03:28:15.309 --> 03:28:15.319 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Pro providers in
 
03:28:17.710 --> 03:28:17.720 align:start position:0%

03:28:21.229 --> 03:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
proposed is not uh hb1
 
03:28:23.790 --> 03:28:23.800 align:start position:0%
1427 currently the state licensed
 
03:28:25.510 --> 03:28:25.520 align:start position:0%

03:28:33.309 --> 03:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
would offer medical school graduates a

03:28:45.510 --> 03:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
like those in 25 other states enjoy full

practice Authority allowing them to
 
03:28:50.189 --> 03:28:50.199 align:start position:0%
practice free of MD supervision and with

03:28:55.110 --> 03:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
American Medical Association has long
 
03:28:56.870 --> 03:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
advocated that the Education and
 
03:28:59.269 --> 03:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
Training to be a medical doctor must be
 
03:29:01.550 --> 03:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
comprehensive including classroom

laboratory or Direct Care experiences
 
03:29:07.910 --> 03:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
since the NP role was established in
 
03:29:10.269 --> 03:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
1965 research has consistently
 
03:29:13.229 --> 03:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
demonstrated the excellent outcomes and

highquality care provided by nurse
 
03:29:17.150 --> 03:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
practitioners the body of literature
 
03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
supports the position that NPS provide
 
03:29:21.469 --> 03:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
care that is safe effective patient
 
03:29:24.229 --> 03:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
centered efficient Equitable and
 
03:29:26.550 --> 03:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
evidence-based there is no such clear
 
03:29:28.630 --> 03:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
evidence that medical student graduates
 
03:29:30.510 --> 03:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
who have not matched with an accredited
 
03:29:32.910 --> 03:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
residency training program can guarantee
 
03:29:33.990 --> 03:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
the same
 
03:29:37.030 --> 03:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
outcomes currently there are 2600 nurse
 
03:29:39.349 --> 03:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
practitioners licensed in the state with
 
03:29:41.750 --> 03:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
a pathway to train more
 
03:29:44.110 --> 03:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
for example UNH has the advanced nursing
 
03:29:46.229 --> 03:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
education Workforce Grant which is
 
03:29:48.910 --> 03:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
funding to prepare Primary Care family

health nurse practitioners to uh provide
 
03:29:57.710 --> 03:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
care in Rural and underserved settings
 
03:30:00.309 --> 03:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh currently medical school graduates do
 
03:30:02.990 --> 03:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
not have to complete a Residency program
 
03:30:04.349 --> 03:30:04.359 align:start position:0%
however they would need to complete a
 
03:30:06.469 --> 03:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
Residency program to be licensed as an
 
03:30:09.070 --> 03:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
independent practitioner residency
 
03:30:11.349 --> 03:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
training means participating in gradu
 
03:30:13.750 --> 03:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
medical education once a doctor in
 
03:30:16.150 --> 03:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
training has completed their gme and has
 
03:30:19.349 --> 03:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
passed two all three steps of the
 
03:30:21.110 --> 03:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
training they can become practicing

03:30:26.790 --> 03:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
anywhere between three and or more years
 
03:30:28.950 --> 03:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
to substitute this highly structured
 
03:30:31.030 --> 03:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
regulated medical Residency program with
 
03:30:33.070 --> 03:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
a practice program with a single
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
practitioner has the potential to impact
 
03:30:37.030 --> 03:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
the safety of many of the most
 
03:30:38.790 --> 03:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
vulnerable patients in Rural and
 
03:30:41.550 --> 03:30:41.560 align:start position:0%

substitution New Hampshire Nurses
 
03:30:45.630 --> 03:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
Association strongly opposes this
 
03:30:47.590 --> 03:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
legislation together with uh our
 
03:30:47.600 --> 03:30:48.590 align:start position:0%
legislation together with uh our
practice

03:30:48.590 --> 03:30:48.600 align:start position:0%

Partners thank you
 
03:30:56.309 --> 03:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
questions bany thank you thank you I
 
03:30:59.389 --> 03:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
just have a question over there in the
 
03:31:03.030 --> 03:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
corner um quick question in terms of the
 
03:31:05.630 --> 03:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage for Physicians isn't
 
03:31:07.870 --> 03:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
that true that since New Hampshire does
 
03:31:10.750 --> 03:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
not have a medical school State Medical
 
03:31:12.710 --> 03:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
scho school the only medical school we
 
03:31:16.030 --> 03:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
have is Dartmouth that is creating a
 
03:31:20.309 --> 03:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
acute shortage to have Physicians um I
 
03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
think like what was said before that
 
03:31:24.030 --> 03:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of reasons for shortage um
 
03:31:25.590 --> 03:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things one of the reasons I
 
03:31:27.309 --> 03:31:27.319 align:start position:0%
was pointing out the nurse practitioners
 
03:31:29.269 --> 03:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
as independent providers is those
 
03:31:31.510 --> 03:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
graduates often stay in New Hampshire
 
03:31:33.110 --> 03:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the evidence is that while
 
03:31:35.229 --> 03:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth is our medical school not many
 
03:31:37.070 --> 03:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
of those continue to practice in New
 
03:31:39.870 --> 03:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and representative maputi it's
 
03:31:42.269 --> 03:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
not a local short shortage there's a
 
03:31:44.550 --> 03:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
nationwide shortage of medical
 
03:31:44.560 --> 03:31:47.189 align:start position:0%
nationwide shortage of medical
professionals

03:31:47.189 --> 03:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
03:31:49.870 --> 03:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
corre representative Brown thank you
 
03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair this will probably come up
 
03:31:54.269 --> 03:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
in subcommittee more but
 
03:31:58.309 --> 03:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh NPS as independent practitioners do
 
03:32:01.469 --> 03:32:01.479 align:start position:0%
they require some kind of a residency or
 
03:32:03.429 --> 03:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
something of that nature before they get
 
03:32:06.030 --> 03:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
that far they have practicum hours that
 
03:32:07.429 --> 03:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
they have to complete as part of their
 
03:32:07.439 --> 03:32:09.550 align:start position:0%
they have to complete as part of their
program

03:32:09.550 --> 03:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:32:13.150 --> 03:32:13.160 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very
 
03:32:21.990 --> 03:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:25.309 --> 03:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
Campion good afternoon Madam chair and
 
03:32:28.030 --> 03:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
members of Edna uh my name is pully
 
03:32:30.710 --> 03:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
Campion I am a former representative I
 
03:32:33.790 --> 03:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
spent a year on this committee um and I
 
03:32:36.550 --> 03:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
recognize some of my uh former uh
 
03:32:39.030 --> 03:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
committee mates many of you are new
 
03:32:41.590 --> 03:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
since that time but um it was was a
 
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
fascinating process for me I am a
 
03:32:46.910 --> 03:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
registered nurse and I'm here today as a
 
03:32:49.670 --> 03:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
member of the state Commission on Aging
 
03:32:53.189 --> 03:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
um I also had the opportunity of uh
 
03:32:56.110 --> 03:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
testifying on the floor actually um
 
03:32:58.349 --> 03:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
against the floor of the house against
 
03:33:00.950 --> 03:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
this bill the last time it came up 2018
 
03:33:00.960 --> 03:33:01.910 align:start position:0%
this bill the last time it came up 2018
and

03:33:01.910 --> 03:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:06.469 --> 03:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
2019 um and except for the title nothing
 
03:33:08.189 --> 03:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
in the text has
 
03:33:11.269 --> 03:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
changed um what I'd like to just
 
03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
reinforce I have um testimony that I
 
03:33:16.110 --> 03:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
emailed to each of you and I have copies
 
03:33:26.030 --> 03:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:28.630 --> 03:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
around I'm not going to read it all you
 
03:33:30.910 --> 03:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
had it in email you have it in hard copy
 
03:33:33.070 --> 03:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with some of you um but I'd
 
03:33:35.630 --> 03:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
like to make a couple of points um to
 
03:33:38.309 --> 03:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
reinforce what has been said um but also
 
03:33:40.309 --> 03:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
to speak specifically about the effect
 
03:33:45.110 --> 03:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
on older adults of uh licensing um this
 
03:33:47.790 --> 03:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
new form of providing
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
care we all recognize that there is a
 
03:33:52.950 --> 03:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
shortage of primary care providers but
 
03:33:55.910 --> 03:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
this is a very flawed solution to that
 
03:33:58.950 --> 03:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and just to jump to the fact that we
 
03:34:02.110 --> 03:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
don't have enough residency slots in the
 
03:34:05.870 --> 03:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
country or in the state um uh Senate
 
03:34:09.389 --> 03:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
Bill 403 actually proposes providing
 
03:34:11.590 --> 03:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
funding to support a Family Practice
 
03:34:14.950 --> 03:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
Residency program in Coos County um so
 
03:34:16.550 --> 03:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's a potentially better way of
 
03:34:19.510 --> 03:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
addressing the shortage of Physicians um
 
03:34:22.070 --> 03:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's already been stated but I'll re um
 
03:34:25.150 --> 03:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
emphasize the fact that um the deputy
 
03:34:27.550 --> 03:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
physician the way this bill is written
 
03:34:30.269 --> 03:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
would need to find a essentially a
 
03:34:33.030 --> 03:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
mentor a collaborating physician who
 
03:34:36.110 --> 03:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
would then be responsible for Designing
 
03:34:39.269 --> 03:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
the equivalent of a Residency program
 
03:34:41.830 --> 03:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
the language says with da HHS and with
 
03:34:44.429 --> 03:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
medical schools um to be named and I
 
03:34:46.830 --> 03:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
don't think that medical schools um have
 
03:34:49.150 --> 03:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
volunteered to help um put their
 
03:34:52.269 --> 03:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
energies into um designing this training
 
03:34:54.990 --> 03:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
program versus those that have been
 
03:34:58.389 --> 03:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
approved um by the accrediting
 
03:35:01.429 --> 03:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
boards the deputy physician as outlined
 
03:35:05.110 --> 03:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
in the um text would effectively
 
03:35:07.790 --> 03:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
practice an equivalent way as a
 
03:35:07.800 --> 03:35:09.070 align:start position:0%
practice an equivalent way as a
physician

03:35:09.070 --> 03:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
physician
 
03:35:12.070 --> 03:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
assistant um without the benefit of
 
03:35:14.910 --> 03:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
being able to bill for services um as we
 
03:35:14.920 --> 03:35:15.830 align:start position:0%
being able to bill for services um as we
have

03:35:15.830 --> 03:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:35:19.030 --> 03:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
heard the proposed grant program um
 
03:35:22.349 --> 03:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
would further promote a second level of
 
03:35:25.030 --> 03:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
care to those already in greatest needs
 
03:35:26.830 --> 03:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
and at greatest effect of the fact that
 
03:35:29.189 --> 03:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
we don't we have inadequate Services
 
03:35:32.349 --> 03:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
particularly in rural areas the effect
 
03:35:36.269 --> 03:35:36.279 align:start position:0%
on older adults um would be such that
 
03:35:38.510 --> 03:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
older adults those of us as we age and
 
03:35:41.229 --> 03:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
we all are aging tend to to carry with
 
03:35:43.389 --> 03:35:43.399 align:start position:0%
us our life experience that include
 
03:35:43.399 --> 03:35:44.710 align:start position:0%
us our life experience that include
chronic

03:35:44.710 --> 03:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
chronic
 
03:35:47.950 --> 03:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
illnesses the care that I need is much
 
03:35:49.950 --> 03:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
more sophisticated than the care that I
 
03:35:53.189 --> 03:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
needed when I was younger um we need
 
03:35:55.550 --> 03:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
care providers who are experienced and
 
03:35:57.790 --> 03:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable in diagnosis and
 
03:36:01.710 --> 03:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
recognition of um the difference between
 
03:36:04.429 --> 03:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
an exacerbation of a chronic illness and
 
03:36:07.349 --> 03:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
a new onset acute illness and this
 
03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
particularly may show up in cases in
 
03:36:13.309 --> 03:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
which m memory starts to fade it is not
 
03:36:15.670 --> 03:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
true that we all lose our memories as we
 
03:36:17.790 --> 03:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
age and we all develop dementia as we
 
03:36:20.790 --> 03:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
age um and often there may be a
 
03:36:23.550 --> 03:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
metabolic condition that causes changes
 
03:36:25.750 --> 03:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
is changes in cognition or
 
03:36:28.269 --> 03:36:28.279 align:start position:0%
mentation and if we have providers who
 
03:36:30.790 --> 03:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
have no experience or limited experience
 
03:36:33.990 --> 03:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
in patient care and don't have the
 
03:36:35.590 --> 03:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
support they need to gain that
 
03:36:38.070 --> 03:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
experience and that knowledge um we are
 
03:36:40.830 --> 03:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
much more likely to see mistreatment and
 
03:36:43.269 --> 03:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of acute
 
03:36:45.990 --> 03:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
exacerbations um and of chronic
 
03:36:49.269 --> 03:36:49.279 align:start position:0%
illnesses as well as new onset um in
 
03:36:53.030 --> 03:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
addition I think the work the rules uh
 
03:36:56.189 --> 03:36:56.199 align:start position:0%
and the effort and expense required to
 
03:36:59.110 --> 03:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
to set up this program would distract
 
03:37:01.229 --> 03:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
from all of those resources and the
 
03:37:03.630 --> 03:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
effort that actually could go toward a
 
03:37:06.590 --> 03:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
more um significant solution and with
 
03:37:10.910 --> 03:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
that I ask that you vote itl um on this
 
03:37:13.830 --> 03:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
um bad bill um I will also say the
 
03:37:15.790 --> 03:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor um who introduced the bill
 
03:37:17.510 --> 03:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there were a number of
 
03:37:19.750 --> 03:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
states that have implemented this I
 
03:37:23.229 --> 03:37:23.239 align:start position:0%
believe that that may not be the case um
 
03:37:26.030 --> 03:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
Missouri uh to my knowledge is the only
 
03:37:27.910 --> 03:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
state that has actually implemented this
 
03:37:30.830 --> 03:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
role and hired individuals into it um a
 
03:37:33.990 --> 03:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
number of other states in the 2017 2018
 
03:37:37.870 --> 03:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
time period proposed legislation um but
 
03:37:40.469 --> 03:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
to the extent I was able to um follow up
 
03:37:42.630 --> 03:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
up on that it appears that they have not
 
03:37:44.790 --> 03:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
been successful and I know that there
 
03:37:46.990 --> 03:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
are experts behind me who will be able
 
03:37:49.590 --> 03:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
to speak to that to a greater extent and
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
with that I'd accept any questions but
 
03:37:52.389 --> 03:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:37:55.189 --> 03:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
experts all right thank you very much
 
03:37:55.199 --> 03:37:55.870 align:start position:0%
experts all right thank you very much
thank

03:37:55.870 --> 03:37:55.880 align:start position:0%

Association I'm not going to read my
 
03:38:34.189 --> 03:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
testimony that went around to the
 
03:38:37.590 --> 03:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
committee uh as many of the points uh we
 
03:38:40.389 --> 03:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
rais have been raised by others um I
 
03:38:42.550 --> 03:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
list in bullet form on my testimony each
 
03:38:43.510 --> 03:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
of those
 
03:38:46.670 --> 03:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
concerns um want to reiterate our
 
03:38:48.189 --> 03:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
opposition to
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
1427 uh with sever several concerns um
 
03:38:54.070 --> 03:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
we have heard from colleagues in
 
03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
Missouri that implemented this uh and
 
03:38:59.630 --> 03:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
they've shared their experience um
 
03:39:02.030 --> 03:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
challenges with securing malpractice
 
03:39:05.389 --> 03:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
insurance challenges with securing
 
03:39:08.670 --> 03:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursement uh from carriers and uh
 
03:39:11.229 --> 03:39:11.239 align:start position:0%
Contracting with insurance I'm happy to
 
03:39:15.710 --> 03:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
take your questions okay are
 
03:39:21.990 --> 03:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%

03:39:56.189 --> 03:39:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:57.710 --> 03:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
turn your microphone on
 
03:40:00.870 --> 03:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
please there you go there we go thank
 
03:40:04.469 --> 03:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
you let me see what I look like um my
 
03:40:07.870 --> 03:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
name is Nick penovich I've um lived in
 
03:40:10.469 --> 03:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
the conquered area for 36 years I'm a
 
03:40:12.550 --> 03:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
semi-retired uh General and vascular
 
03:40:16.269 --> 03:40:16.279 align:start position:0%
surgeon um I don't operate anymore the
 
03:40:18.550 --> 03:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
last 10 years but I've continued to
 
03:40:20.910 --> 03:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
teach and literally this morning with
 
03:40:22.750 --> 03:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
two Dartmouth medical students and two
 
03:40:25.389 --> 03:40:25.399 align:start position:0%
residents from Dartmouth and I've done
 
03:40:27.229 --> 03:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
that uh pretty much my whole career in
 
03:40:29.469 --> 03:40:29.479 align:start position:0%
conquered and uh prior to that for about
 
03:40:30.950 --> 03:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
eight years in Boston when I lived in
 
03:40:33.830 --> 03:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts with medical students so I
 
03:40:35.710 --> 03:40:35.720 align:start position:0%
have a fairly strong relationship with
 
03:40:37.910 --> 03:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
teaching and it's been mostly uh in New
 
03:40:39.429 --> 03:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire entirely through Dartmouth one
 
03:40:40.790 --> 03:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
of the questions yes there's only one
 
03:40:43.830 --> 03:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
med school at Dartmouth um there are
 
03:40:45.550 --> 03:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
other Med schools nearby and that's kind
 
03:40:48.070 --> 03:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
of critical in this bill um because
 
03:40:49.590 --> 03:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
there's some discussion of it on page
 
03:40:52.030 --> 03:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
seven of adjacent met schools and
 
03:40:55.750 --> 03:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
residency training programs um I'm not
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
representing anybody um other than uh
 
03:41:03.429 --> 03:41:03.439 align:start position:0%
myself at this point um The Residency is
 
03:41:05.750 --> 03:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
something that I went through many years
 
03:41:07.790 --> 03:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
ago but I also was the director of the
 
03:41:09.469 --> 03:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
surgical residency in Dartmouth we've
 
03:41:12.189 --> 03:41:12.199 align:start position:0%
had a saddle and conquered for 35 years
 
03:41:13.870 --> 03:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
were surgical residents in their second
 
03:41:15.670 --> 03:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
and third year spend time and I was
 
03:41:19.510 --> 03:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
director of that for about 15 years um
 
03:41:21.429 --> 03:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
it's really different than the exposure
 
03:41:23.670 --> 03:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
one gets to patients in med school um
 
03:41:26.309 --> 03:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
and my did some calculation the typical
 
03:41:27.870 --> 03:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
medical student spends their last two
 
03:41:30.630 --> 03:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
years in hospital seeing patients that's
 
03:41:31.710 --> 03:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
important because if you're going to
 
03:41:33.189 --> 03:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
take care of patients you have to see
 
03:41:34.830 --> 03:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
patients before you get the green light
 
03:41:37.389 --> 03:41:37.399 align:start position:0%
to do that and typically that's about
 
03:41:39.990 --> 03:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
4,000 hours those last two years if you
 
03:41:42.349 --> 03:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
if you take two years of
 
03:41:44.349 --> 03:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
residency uh which no residency in the
 
03:41:45.750 --> 03:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
United States is two years they're three
 
03:41:47.670 --> 03:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
years and more uh there was a time it
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
was one year that was called GP and you
 
03:41:53.070 --> 03:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
you rotated through and so forth but if
 
03:41:55.349 --> 03:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
you do two years of a typical residency
 
03:41:57.269 --> 03:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
with the time constraints trying to be
 
03:41:59.229 --> 03:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
respectful of their illness you know
 
03:42:01.950 --> 03:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
time and so forth It's about 9,000 hours
 
03:42:03.349 --> 03:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
in those two years so the typical
 
03:42:06.790 --> 03:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
residency is a little under 15,000 hours
 
03:42:08.389 --> 03:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
and and the difference is when you're a
 
03:42:10.710 --> 03:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
medical student you're writing orders
 
03:42:12.870 --> 03:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
you're observing you're studying you're
 
03:42:15.469 --> 03:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
learning you're getting tested but you
 
03:42:17.110 --> 03:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
don't really have responsibility for the
 
03:42:18.550 --> 03:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
patient you can't write an order the
 
03:42:20.110 --> 03:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
residency all of a sudden it flips
 
03:42:21.710 --> 03:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
you're writing orders you're responsible
 
03:42:23.910 --> 03:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
you're on night call you're making first
 
03:42:26.710 --> 03:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
decisions and after about a year of that
 
03:42:28.229 --> 03:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to get tested and that's
 
03:42:30.229 --> 03:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
called level three so there's a dramatic
 
03:42:31.830 --> 03:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
difference there's a lot of
 
03:42:33.550 --> 03:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility that goes into the
 
03:42:35.349 --> 03:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
typical residency no matter what field
 
03:42:38.229 --> 03:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
it is Primary Care Surgery whatsoever
 
03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
first year residency in most places is
 
03:42:41.870 --> 03:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
very similar because it's being used to
 
03:42:41.880 --> 03:42:42.750 align:start position:0%
very similar because it's being used to
seeing

03:42:42.750 --> 03:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
03:42:45.870 --> 03:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
patients um getting to this exam
 
03:42:49.229 --> 03:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
part uh well I'll talk about step three
 
03:42:50.750 --> 03:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't talk about step one or two
 
03:42:53.349 --> 03:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
but one is after two years of med school
 
03:42:54.830 --> 03:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
and what you're looking at is basic
 
03:42:56.510 --> 03:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
science do you know Anatomy do you know
 
03:42:58.149 --> 03:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
physiology do you know the structure of
 
03:42:59.469 --> 03:42:59.479 align:start position:0%
the body do you know how to look under
 
03:43:01.309 --> 03:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
the microscope and look at slides and
 
03:43:02.550 --> 03:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
stuff like
 
03:43:05.309 --> 03:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
that and once you start seeing patients
 
03:43:07.110 --> 03:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
after those first two years in your
 
03:43:09.309 --> 03:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
third and fourth year that second part
 
03:43:11.269 --> 03:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
of the exam has to do a bit with
 
03:43:13.389 --> 03:43:13.399 align:start position:0%
patients but has most mostly to do with
 
03:43:15.349 --> 03:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
recognizing diseases and understanding
 
03:43:17.790 --> 03:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
it book knowledge of diseases basically
 
03:43:20.429 --> 03:43:20.439 align:start position:0%
pathology both clinical anatomical and
 
03:43:24.550 --> 03:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
radiology and so forth so I typ I spend
 
03:43:26.229 --> 03:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
time with 30-year medical students and
 
03:43:28.229 --> 03:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
they're nowhere near uh being able to
 
03:43:29.750 --> 03:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
take care of patients even at the end of
 
03:43:32.990 --> 03:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
their fourth year the third test if you
 
03:43:34.990 --> 03:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
look up or Google what the third test is
 
03:43:36.750 --> 03:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
about is to whether they have clinical
 
03:43:38.309 --> 03:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
judgment you don't get judgment until
 
03:43:40.510 --> 03:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
you're actually respond responsible for
 
03:43:41.950 --> 03:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
taking care of the patient you need to
 
03:43:44.550 --> 03:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
have a year of that under your belt and
 
03:43:46.309 --> 03:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
whether you're safe
 
03:43:49.070 --> 03:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
unsupervised so residents take this test
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
while they residents after one year
 
03:43:52.670 --> 03:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere usually between the first and
 
03:43:55.229 --> 03:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
second year sometimes the third but the
 
03:43:56.710 --> 03:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
goal is to have you to be safe
 
03:43:58.910 --> 03:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
unsupervised and yet then more people
 
03:44:00.550 --> 03:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
than not end up having one more year of
 
03:44:03.070 --> 03:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
residency so there's a lot involved and
 
03:44:05.429 --> 03:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
with this Deputy um you know we called
 
03:44:08.149 --> 03:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
it Deputy physician now the last bill it
 
03:44:10.590 --> 03:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
was a graduate um
 
03:44:13.349 --> 03:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
physici there isn't this testing of
 
03:44:16.510 --> 03:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
being able to make
 
03:44:16.520 --> 03:44:18.110 align:start position:0%
being able to make
judgment

03:44:18.110 --> 03:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
judgment
 
03:44:21.870 --> 03:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
um there was a time that states created
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
their own level three tests actually
 
03:44:28.349 --> 03:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
load and two uh I'm old I'm 76 years old
 
03:44:30.950 --> 03:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
and when I finished residency if I
 
03:44:32.950 --> 03:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to practice in Florida finish my
 
03:44:34.670 --> 03:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
residency in Boston go to Florida I'd
 
03:44:37.149 --> 03:44:37.159 align:start position:0%
have to take a separate test in Florida
 
03:44:39.070 --> 03:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist anymore it's been 45
 
03:44:41.070 --> 03:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
years I think since Florida has had its
 
03:44:43.630 --> 03:44:43.640 align:start position:0%
own test that's relevant also I'm going
 
03:44:46.910 --> 03:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
to get on to almost done with my
 
03:44:51.110 --> 03:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
comments but um the thing that Disturbed
 
03:44:53.590 --> 03:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
me most about this bill was I mean we
 
03:44:54.870 --> 03:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
saw this stuff a couple years ago it
 
03:44:56.149 --> 03:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't any different what I've talked
 
03:44:59.710 --> 03:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
about now but this test this previous
 
03:45:01.710 --> 03:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
bill was sort of a pilot thing does this
 
03:45:03.710 --> 03:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
make sense can we do it and trying to
 
03:45:06.110 --> 03:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
get support it didn't happen this one
 
03:45:07.790 --> 03:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
isn't listed as a pilot bill it
 
03:45:10.830 --> 03:45:10.840 align:start position:0%
basically is more detailed it's a lot
 
03:45:13.510 --> 03:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
longer uh but if you go to page seven
 
03:45:16.389 --> 03:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
line 17 I'm going to quote what it said
 
03:45:19.269 --> 03:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
there basically it has a pathway for
 
03:45:21.229 --> 03:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
Deputy Physicians to become fully
 
03:45:23.750 --> 03:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
licensed uh in residency training if you
 
03:45:28.030 --> 03:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
look at line 17 Page 7 the New Hampshire
 
03:45:30.550 --> 03:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
ddhs commissioner as well as the Deans
 
03:45:32.510 --> 03:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
of medical schools it's plural so it's
 
03:45:34.389 --> 03:45:34.399 align:start position:0%
not just asking Dartmouth to get
 
03:45:37.110 --> 03:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
involved it could be univers of Vermont
 
03:45:39.830 --> 03:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
it could be U the main do school School
 
03:45:41.309 --> 03:45:41.319 align:start position:0%
in bitterford it could be the four
 
03:45:44.710 --> 03:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
Boston Medical Schools um so it
 
03:45:46.349 --> 03:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
basically says the Deans of medical
 
03:45:48.229 --> 03:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
schools and Primary Care directors to
 
03:45:49.990 --> 03:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
develop and Implement educational
 
03:45:52.110 --> 03:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
methods with collaborative practice to
 
03:45:54.309 --> 03:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
facilitate the deputy Physician Medical
 
03:45:56.510 --> 03:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge and capabilities which may
 
03:45:58.630 --> 03:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
lead to credit towards a future
 
03:46:00.550 --> 03:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
Residency program it's a little vague to
 
03:46:04.790 --> 03:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
me um so I I feel it boy this I'm going
 
03:46:07.030 --> 03:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
to contact people I know I know the dean
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
of the med school who I spoke to this
 
03:46:10.590 --> 03:46:10.600 align:start position:0%
morning and I contacted the head of the
 
03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
residency program in family practice and
 
03:46:14.790 --> 03:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
Conquer The Family Practice program
 
03:46:18.870 --> 03:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
conquer has been around 25 years um the
 
03:46:20.990 --> 03:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
one in new one in Portsmouth I think is
 
03:46:22.870 --> 03:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
three or four years old and we heard a
 
03:46:24.710 --> 03:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
little bit about potentially one in that
 
03:46:26.590 --> 03:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
is a solution creating more primary
 
03:46:28.510 --> 03:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
family practice doctors within the state
 
03:46:31.030 --> 03:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
that sended into the state so I just
 
03:46:35.189 --> 03:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
assume the residency director uh at
 
03:46:36.590 --> 03:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
conquered who I know very well so I
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
contact him two days ago neither of them
 
03:46:40.910 --> 03:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
knew about this bill at all they knew
 
03:46:42.710 --> 03:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
about the old one and one of them had
 
03:46:46.309 --> 03:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
testified against it but it surprised me
 
03:46:48.309 --> 03:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
a lot that the people who wrote up this
 
03:46:50.710 --> 03:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
bill didn't communicate with residency
 
03:46:52.830 --> 03:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
director in the state or the medical
 
03:46:53.950 --> 03:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
school or the
 
03:46:55.830 --> 03:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
dean um
 
03:46:58.469 --> 03:46:58.479 align:start position:0%
so I don't think the homework was done
 
03:47:00.070 --> 03:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
and and the homework may be where the
 
03:47:02.110 --> 03:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
solution is the dean's comment to me
 
03:47:04.429 --> 03:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
this morning was I would really like to
 
03:47:06.950 --> 03:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
work with the state he actually spoke to
 
03:47:08.309 --> 03:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
the governor he talked to me about
 
03:47:10.189 --> 03:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
speaking to the governor ly in the last
 
03:47:12.830 --> 03:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
few months about trying to work on this
 
03:47:15.229 --> 03:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
problem because it's really a problem
 
03:47:17.550 --> 03:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
and uh I think that's the way to go I
 
03:47:20.710 --> 03:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
think is to engage the medical school uh
 
03:47:22.590 --> 03:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
maybe with this new program up in cous
 
03:47:24.990 --> 03:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
County so that do we have people who can
 
03:47:27.149 --> 03:47:27.159 align:start position:0%
finish a Residency program and complete
 
03:47:30.149 --> 03:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
the level three and the other part of
 
03:47:32.389 --> 03:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
this bill in addition to creating a
 
03:47:34.189 --> 03:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
method of residency talked about an
 
03:47:36.710 --> 03:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
alternative to step three there isn't
 
03:47:41.429 --> 03:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
one now uh if you Google step three MLS
 
03:47:43.070 --> 03:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
you know the the medical license
 
03:47:44.950 --> 03:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
examination there are testing out there
 
03:47:46.990 --> 03:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
that you can pay money for to prepare
 
03:47:50.389 --> 03:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
you for this test um but there isn't a
 
03:47:52.070 --> 03:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
separate test there hasn't been a
 
03:47:55.110 --> 03:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
separate test since Florida 45 50 years
 
03:47:58.149 --> 03:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
ago um the other thing I did other than
 
03:48:00.950 --> 03:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
operate and educate is I spent 17 years
 
03:48:03.590 --> 03:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
until 2019 as a member of the New
 
03:48:05.110 --> 03:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of Medicine in various
 
03:48:07.630 --> 03:48:07.640 align:start position:0%
capacity member of the board member of
 
03:48:09.950 --> 03:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
the uh medical uh sub committee that
 
03:48:12.710 --> 03:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist as of this summer and as a
 
03:48:15.790 --> 03:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
physician investigator uh Dr Conway will
 
03:48:19.309 --> 03:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
comment on that too but if this goes
 
03:48:21.269 --> 03:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
ahead and you have Deputy Physicians out
 
03:48:24.189 --> 03:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
there with collaborative supervising
 
03:48:26.309 --> 03:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
people there's going to be some mistakes
 
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
out there and those mistakes come to the
 
03:48:29.550 --> 03:48:29.560 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine either as complaints
 
03:48:31.229 --> 03:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
or lawsuits so the ultimate
 
03:48:33.670 --> 03:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility of making sure this is to
 
03:48:36.630 --> 03:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
the public is in the hands of the oplc
 
03:48:38.269 --> 03:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
which you know about as well as the
 
03:48:40.070 --> 03:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine
 
03:48:42.149 --> 03:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
and um you've got to get the you've got
 
03:48:43.790 --> 03:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
to get the Board of Medicine
 
03:48:45.349 --> 03:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
particularly the Physicians of the Board
 
03:48:47.910 --> 03:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
of Medicine to sign on to this too
 
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
because when bad things happen it comes
 
03:48:51.429 --> 03:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
to that board and that board has to
 
03:48:52.990 --> 03:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
figure out what to do and I don't think
 
03:48:54.550 --> 03:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
they're interested in being a de facto
 
03:48:56.510 --> 03:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
Residency program nor should the state
 
03:48:57.510 --> 03:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
of New
 
03:49:03.429 --> 03:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:10.830 --> 03:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
vanti go ahead
 
03:49:12.349 --> 03:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:49:15.990 --> 03:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
taking uh my question I have very
 
03:49:19.349 --> 03:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
specific question in terms of when a
 
03:49:22.389 --> 03:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
medical student gets a
 
03:49:24.710 --> 03:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
residency uh outside of where they went
 
03:49:27.510 --> 03:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
to medical school very common very
 
03:49:30.830 --> 03:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
common more common than not more yes can
 
03:49:33.910 --> 03:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
have you know or in your experience do
 
03:49:36.990 --> 03:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
they stay back in the state that they
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
did their
 
03:49:41.510 --> 03:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
residency uh because they have a
 
03:49:45.229 --> 03:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
choice or do they go
 
03:49:48.189 --> 03:49:48.199 align:start position:0%
elsewhere so um there's this thing
 
03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
called a match which hasn't brought up
 
03:49:51.790 --> 03:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
which is a computer it wasn't
 
03:49:54.550 --> 03:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
computerized but existed in my day so
 
03:49:56.990 --> 03:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
you you want to go somewhere and you
 
03:49:58.229 --> 03:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
don't know where that place is going to
 
03:49:59.870 --> 03:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
take you
 
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
um I know in my case I trained in Boston
 
03:50:04.469 --> 03:50:04.479 align:start position:0%
I did my residency in Boston and I
 
03:50:07.670 --> 03:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
stayed in New England eventually uh you
 
03:50:10.630 --> 03:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
tend to hover near where you train uh
 
03:50:12.790 --> 03:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
training programs traditionally have
 
03:50:14.790 --> 03:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
often when they finish a residency tried
 
03:50:16.269 --> 03:50:16.279 align:start position:0%
to get their best and brightest and keep
 
03:50:18.590 --> 03:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
them there as future faculty that's a
 
03:50:22.910 --> 03:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
small number um in Primary
 
03:50:26.550 --> 03:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
Care uh where I trained at Dartmouth I
 
03:50:27.950 --> 03:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
trained initially at Dartmouth and then
 
03:50:30.790 --> 03:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
in Boston um particularly this Residency
 
03:50:32.590 --> 03:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
program that's been around 25 years the
 
03:50:35.030 --> 03:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
emphasis has been the key people here
 
03:50:37.990 --> 03:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
and their track Rec track record is true
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
um conquered Hospital currently has I
 
03:50:42.110 --> 03:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
think somewhere around close to 30
 
03:50:44.469 --> 03:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
doctors in primary care who all trained
 
03:50:46.710 --> 03:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
in their own Residency program there
 
03:50:48.510 --> 03:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
were three members who trained in their
 
03:50:50.030 --> 03:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
Residency program who've been president
 
03:50:51.790 --> 03:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Medical Society so
 
03:50:53.590 --> 03:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't leave New Hampshire they
 
03:50:55.229 --> 03:50:55.239 align:start position:0%
didn't go up to the North Country which
 
03:50:56.870 --> 03:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
is really what we want to do here I
 
03:50:59.269 --> 03:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
think but if you train them in the North
 
03:51:02.189 --> 03:51:02.199 align:start position:0%
Country they may stay there and I think
 
03:51:05.710 --> 03:51:05.720 align:start position:0%
that's the solution to this problem um
 
03:51:07.870 --> 03:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
you know medical schools have actually
 
03:51:10.550 --> 03:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
expanded to understand why there's 5,000
 
03:51:12.349 --> 03:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
people who haven't matched it's because
 
03:51:14.110 --> 03:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
there's more medical schools graduating
 
03:51:15.670 --> 03:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
people and it hasn't kept up with the
 
03:51:18.389 --> 03:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
number of residency slots resident slots
 
03:51:21.030 --> 03:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
are very dependent on funding uh from
 
03:51:22.990 --> 03:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government medical schools
 
03:51:24.110 --> 03:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
they get federal government through
 
03:51:26.030 --> 03:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
research grants and so forth but
 
03:51:28.269 --> 03:51:28.279 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid payments to
 
03:51:31.510 --> 03:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals to train residents is
 
03:51:33.429 --> 03:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
significantly higher if you're training
 
03:51:35.149 --> 03:51:35.159 align:start position:0%
critical number of residents typically
 
03:51:37.790 --> 03:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
20 or more
 
03:51:39.710 --> 03:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
so if you
 
03:51:41.189 --> 03:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
I think we could increase the number of
 
03:51:42.750 --> 03:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
doctors training in the country if there
 
03:51:44.550 --> 03:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
was more Federal funding for it or
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
interest in getting more Federal funding
 
03:51:48.510 --> 03:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
going that to me is also a solution in
 
03:51:50.309 --> 03:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
addition to creating more residencies
 
03:51:51.710 --> 03:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
which is what we need to do but you've
 
03:51:53.550 --> 03:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
got to have Federal support which is
 
03:51:55.269 --> 03:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
usually connected to a hospital so most
 
03:51:57.510 --> 03:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
residents train in a hospital even
 
03:51:59.349 --> 03:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
Family Practice residents at conqur
 
03:52:01.590 --> 03:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
spend almost half their time in conqur
 
03:52:04.710 --> 03:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:07.910 --> 03:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
office okay represent any other
 
03:52:10.110 --> 03:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank thank you m I'm sorry I
 
03:52:15.189 --> 03:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:19.469 --> 03:52:19.479 align:start position:0%
question so uh in typical residency the
 
03:52:24.510 --> 03:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh the resident physician is is learning
 
03:52:26.990 --> 03:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
is practicing and so forth in the in the
 
03:52:29.630 --> 03:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
course of that thing as working with
 
03:52:33.389 --> 03:52:33.399 align:start position:0%
patients and and how is that build how's
 
03:52:38.309 --> 03:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
that build yeah um it's build entirely
 
03:52:42.189 --> 03:52:42.199 align:start position:0%
not the work the resident does he gets a
 
03:52:44.510 --> 03:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
salary but it isn't dependent on how
 
03:52:46.990 --> 03:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
much work he does right those people
 
03:52:50.189 --> 03:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
supervising him uh the we call typical
 
03:52:52.670 --> 03:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
word is not collaborator but attending
 
03:52:54.349 --> 03:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of them in an academic
 
03:52:56.149 --> 03:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
center they're the ones submitting the
 
03:52:58.630 --> 03:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
bills of the work that gets done because
 
03:53:00.429 --> 03:53:00.439 align:start position:0%
they've signed off kind of like the farm
 
03:53:02.349 --> 03:53:02.359 align:start position:0%
they are totally responsible and during
 
03:53:04.870 --> 03:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
that time at the for when you get a a
 
03:53:06.269 --> 03:53:06.279 align:start position:0%
resident in New Hampshire gets a New
 
03:53:07.990 --> 03:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license but it's a special
 
03:53:10.189 --> 03:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
resident license right has a little r
 
03:53:14.030 --> 03:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
next to it um whenever they make a
 
03:53:15.670 --> 03:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
mistake or a problem and it comes to the
 
03:53:17.309 --> 03:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine we don't go after that
 
03:53:18.670 --> 03:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
Resident we'll we'll interview the
 
03:53:19.950 --> 03:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
resident we'll find out about the
 
03:53:22.349 --> 03:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
resident we go after the attending sure
 
03:53:25.309 --> 03:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of the responsible part
 
03:53:27.070 --> 03:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
and I would hope the collaborators in
 
03:53:29.910 --> 03:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
this this Deputy plan understand that
 
03:53:31.070 --> 03:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
because I think that's how the Board of
 
03:53:33.149 --> 03:53:33.159 align:start position:0%
Medicine would look at it okay huge
 
03:53:34.590 --> 03:53:34.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility that's why I ended this
 
03:53:36.750 --> 03:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
discussion about responsibility at the
 
03:53:39.030 --> 03:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine and the legislature
 
03:53:40.790 --> 03:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
right thank you very
 
03:53:54.070 --> 03:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:56.510 --> 03:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
Conway thank you madam chairman and
 
03:53:59.110 --> 03:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee
 
03:54:03.710 --> 03:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
um Talk the bring it closer is that
 
03:54:08.070 --> 03:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
better yes much thank you um I brought
 
03:54:10.870 --> 03:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
or I sent testimony to you
 
03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
electronically which you should have I
 
03:54:15.309 --> 03:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
also brought copies of it with me today
 
03:54:17.710 --> 03:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
which I distributed and I'll apologize
 
03:54:20.670 --> 03:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
for the fact that page three is really
 
03:54:22.550 --> 03:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
page two
 
03:54:25.309 --> 03:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
of all right we'll we'll approximate
 
03:54:27.710 --> 03:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
that one
 
03:54:32.750 --> 03:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I am a semi- I am a retired
 
03:54:35.790 --> 03:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
OBGYN um I practiced when I finished my
 
03:54:37.830 --> 03:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
residency I practiced in a group
 
03:54:39.429 --> 03:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
practice in Portland Main
 
03:54:42.189 --> 03:54:42.199 align:start position:0%
from there I went to a rural area of
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania which was underserved so I
 
03:54:46.670 --> 03:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
know a little bit about Staffing
 
03:54:49.110 --> 03:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
underserved communities um and I was
 
03:54:50.550 --> 03:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
there for about eight years before I
 
03:54:52.389 --> 03:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
moved to conquered in
 
03:54:55.990 --> 03:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
2001 and I was on the staff at the uh
 
03:54:58.550 --> 03:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
residency here in conquer I worked with
 
03:55:00.349 --> 03:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
residents I worked with medical students
 
03:55:03.990 --> 03:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
I know what that's about um I know how
 
03:55:07.269 --> 03:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
um medical school graduates uh end up
 
03:55:09.269 --> 03:55:09.279 align:start position:0%
with residency positions I'd like to
 
03:55:11.189 --> 03:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
correct a couple of things that
 
03:55:16.389 --> 03:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
representative um cot Cole I'm sorry
 
03:55:20.349 --> 03:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
said that um as far as the number of
 
03:55:22.910 --> 03:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
residency positions in
 
03:55:25.269 --> 03:55:25.279 align:start position:0%
2023 there were
 
03:55:32.070 --> 03:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
4,375 positions um uh total of those uh
 
03:55:32.080 --> 03:55:33.469 align:start position:0%
4,375 positions um uh total of those uh
only

03:55:33.469 --> 03:55:33.479 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:55:37.349 --> 03:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
2,685 were not filled in the first round
 
03:55:39.630 --> 03:55:39.640 align:start position:0%
of the match which has been describe to
 
03:55:44.309 --> 03:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
you um one of the alternatives to um
 
03:55:47.349 --> 03:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
medical school graduates who don't match
 
03:55:49.550 --> 03:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
is What's called the um supplemental
 
03:55:52.429 --> 03:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
offer and acceptance program where they
 
03:55:54.429 --> 03:55:54.439 align:start position:0%
go into another list which is
 
03:55:57.229 --> 03:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
distributed to residencies that don't
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
fill um and of those only 227 were
 
03:56:04.910 --> 03:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately unmatched so you're talking
 
03:56:05.990 --> 03:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
about only
 
03:56:09.670 --> 03:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
227 medical school graduates
 
03:56:11.990 --> 03:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
that ultimately did not have a residency
 
03:56:14.110 --> 03:56:14.120 align:start position:0%
position after they
 
03:56:16.349 --> 03:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
graduated one other correction I'd like
 
03:56:18.389 --> 03:56:18.399 align:start position:0%
to make is somebody who graduates from
 
03:56:20.070 --> 03:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
medical school is a
 
03:56:20.080 --> 03:56:22.309 align:start position:0%
medical school is a
doctor

03:56:22.309 --> 03:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
03:56:25.429 --> 03:56:25.439 align:start position:0%
period that doctor cannot practice
 
03:56:28.149 --> 03:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
cannot be licensed until they have
 
03:56:30.030 --> 03:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
received some kind of
 
03:56:33.670 --> 03:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
training um I testified against the
 
03:56:38.950 --> 03:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
earlier um uh bills in 2018 and 2019 and
 
03:56:40.110 --> 03:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
the only thing that's changed in this
 
03:56:43.309 --> 03:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
bill is the title it's a deputy
 
03:56:45.469 --> 03:56:45.479 align:start position:0%
physician instead of an assistant
 
03:56:47.550 --> 03:56:47.560 align:start position:0%
physician instead of a graduate
 
03:56:50.710 --> 03:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
physician that my biggest objection has
 
03:56:54.389 --> 03:56:54.399 align:start position:0%
been the lack of
 
03:56:58.229 --> 03:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
supervision uh of the Deputy physician
 
03:57:00.149 --> 03:57:00.159 align:start position:0%
that the only thing that's required
 
03:57:02.429 --> 03:57:02.439 align:start position:0%
there are two things that are required
 
03:57:06.070 --> 03:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
that in the initial month the deputy
 
03:57:08.710 --> 03:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
physician or the collaborating physician
 
03:57:11.750 --> 03:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
must be in close proximity in the same
 
03:57:14.309 --> 03:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
in the same office to be available to
 
03:57:15.950 --> 03:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
the deputy
 
03:57:18.030 --> 03:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
physician after
 
03:57:22.149 --> 03:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
that the deputy physician has to submit
 
03:57:22.159 --> 03:57:23.630 align:start position:0%
that the deputy physician has to submit
um

03:57:23.630 --> 03:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:28.590 --> 03:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
10% of his records every two weeks for
 
03:57:32.990 --> 03:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
the uh collaborating physician to uh
 
03:57:35.910 --> 03:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
review that's retrospective
 
03:57:38.349 --> 03:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
care that's the deputy physician is
 
03:57:41.990 --> 03:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
making decisions about care but it's not
 
03:57:43.630 --> 03:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
being reviewed by The collaborating
 
03:57:46.830 --> 03:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
Physician for two weeks so who knows if
 
03:57:48.349 --> 03:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
he's making the right
 
03:57:48.359 --> 03:57:51.389 align:start position:0%
he's making the right
decisions

03:57:51.389 --> 03:57:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:54.149 --> 03:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a whole lot more I was I
 
03:57:56.229 --> 03:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
had this I was not going to read the
 
03:57:58.149 --> 03:57:58.159 align:start position:0%
testimony I gave to you it tends to get
 
03:58:02.349 --> 03:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
tiresome after a while um one thing that
 
03:58:06.030 --> 03:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
uh this bill provides for is a track to
 
03:58:08.590 --> 03:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
getting a full medical license without
 
03:58:11.429 --> 03:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
ever having done a
 
03:58:13.830 --> 03:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
residency that I will tell you that
 
03:58:16.950 --> 03:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
residencies in the first year here with
 
03:58:19.030 --> 03:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
this residency
 
03:58:22.590 --> 03:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
um every single patient that the
 
03:58:26.189 --> 03:58:26.199 align:start position:0%
resident saw had to be reviewed that day
 
03:58:28.670 --> 03:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
before the patient left to make sure
 
03:58:33.269 --> 03:58:33.279 align:start position:0%
that care was appropriate that the uh
 
03:58:36.750 --> 03:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
diagnosis the residents came up with was
 
03:58:39.630 --> 03:58:39.640 align:start position:0%
accurate that's not happening
 
03:58:40.870 --> 03:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
with a deputy
 
03:58:44.110 --> 03:58:44.120 align:start position:0%
physician it's just not
 
03:58:44.120 --> 03:58:46.110 align:start position:0%
physician it's just not
happening

03:58:46.110 --> 03:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
happening
 
03:58:50.710 --> 03:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
um another correction as far as uh other
 
03:58:52.910 --> 03:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh Deputy uh physician programs around
 
03:58:57.429 --> 03:58:57.439 align:start position:0%
the country as of uh 2023 uh Missouri
 
03:58:58.950 --> 03:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
was the first one that was established
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
in 2014 there are currently uh eight um
 
03:59:05.750 --> 03:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
I don't have the list here um but there
 
03:59:08.670 --> 03:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
are eight other programs um and the
 
03:59:12.910 --> 03:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
intent of those programs is to uh not
 
03:59:16.389 --> 03:59:16.399 align:start position:0%
move towards full lure after X number of
 
03:59:19.990 --> 03:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
years but to move towards actually doing
 
03:59:23.830 --> 03:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
a residency where they had uh supervised
 
03:59:23.840 --> 03:59:25.870 align:start position:0%
a residency where they had uh supervised
training

03:59:25.870 --> 03:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
um what this bill is trying to do is to
 
03:59:32.110 --> 03:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
return uh us to the apprenticeship
 
03:59:35.389 --> 03:59:35.399 align:start position:0%
program which was done away with uh in
 
03:59:36.670 --> 03:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
the late
 
03:59:39.429 --> 03:59:39.439 align:start position:0%
1800s um and
 
03:59:41.550 --> 03:59:41.560 align:start position:0%
the outcome of that has been improved
 
03:59:44.830 --> 03:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
care where there was very organized uh
 
03:59:48.309 --> 03:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
specific training provided to those
 
03:59:48.319 --> 03:59:53.550 align:start position:0%
specific training provided to those
Physicians

03:59:53.550 --> 03:59:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:56.189 --> 03:59:56.199 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Cole talked about
 
03:59:58.790 --> 03:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
shadowing physicians in residency
 
04:00:00.830 --> 04:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
shadowing means you follow around and
 
04:00:04.590 --> 04:00:04.600 align:start position:0%
you watch what a physician is doing not
 
04:00:06.510 --> 04:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
the case as a resident that's what you
 
04:00:08.910 --> 04:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
do as a medical student but as a
 
04:00:11.510 --> 04:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
resident you're the first person who is
 
04:00:14.510 --> 04:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
seeing that patient to make some kind of
 
04:00:16.790 --> 04:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
decision some kind of diagnosis which
 
04:00:20.269 --> 04:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
you then take to the preceptor of the
 
04:00:22.830 --> 04:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
day the person who you have to check out
 
04:00:25.469 --> 04:00:25.479 align:start position:0%
your impressions before that patient
 
04:00:27.590 --> 04:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
goes home I don't have a whole lot more
 
04:00:30.110 --> 04:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
to say um that's not in the testimony
 
04:00:32.070 --> 04:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
that I submitted uh but I'd be glad to
 
04:00:35.349 --> 04:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you are there
 
04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
04:00:37.319 --> 04:00:39.750 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
testimony

04:00:39.750 --> 04:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:00:42.670 --> 04:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
Douglas a if it wasn't clear I'm opposed
 
04:00:45.110 --> 04:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
to this Bill thank you Doctor it was
 
04:00:45.120 --> 04:00:55.630 align:start position:0%

clear Douglas ster how oplc I should
 
04:01:00.389 --> 04:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
only take about a minute of your time uh
 
04:01:01.910 --> 04:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
I was looking at the language and it
 
04:01:03.790 --> 04:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
looks like some of the language as
 
04:01:07.309 --> 04:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
proposed is in conflict with RSA 310 and
 
04:01:08.670 --> 04:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
just sort of the roles and
 
04:01:11.830 --> 04:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so if the committee or
 
04:01:13.750 --> 04:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
we if if the committee should decide to
 
04:01:14.950 --> 04:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
move forward with this bill I'm just
 
04:01:17.790 --> 04:01:17.800 align:start position:0%
offering my services uh so we could
 
04:01:21.070 --> 04:01:21.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment and make those two sort of
 
04:01:23.830 --> 04:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
aign okay thank you very much for that
 
04:01:26.110 --> 04:01:26.120 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll let the subcommittee know
 
04:01:30.990 --> 04:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
that you can help questions all
 
04:01:33.469 --> 04:01:33.479 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much well if it's
 
04:01:36.990 --> 04:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
going to be amended it's going to sub
 
04:01:40.189 --> 04:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
committee all right all right is there
 
04:01:42.309 --> 04:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to testify on
 
04:01:46.710 --> 04:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:46.720 --> 04:01:55.830 align:start position:0%
 
1427

04:01:55.830 --> 04:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:59.790 --> 04:01:59.800 align:start position:0%
sure this will be quick um it's in my
 
04:02:02.510 --> 04:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
written testimony as far as why don't uh
 
04:02:05.710 --> 04:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
medical school graduates match and it's
 
04:02:09.710 --> 04:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
um for a variety of reasons um
 
04:02:12.349 --> 04:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
there probably were
 
04:02:14.870 --> 04:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
about seven reasons anywhere from having
 
04:02:19.590 --> 04:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
low scores on the uh USM League exams
 
04:02:22.189 --> 04:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
during residency being not competitive
 
04:02:25.670 --> 04:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
at their first choice of uh residency
 
04:02:27.510 --> 04:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
lack of appropriate backup or an
 
04:02:30.189 --> 04:02:30.199 align:start position:0%
alternative plan not failure to follow
 
04:02:31.750 --> 04:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
guidance from The Faculty adviser or
 
04:02:34.349 --> 04:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
Dean's office poor interviewing or
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
interpersonal skills did not rank enough
 
04:02:42.429 --> 04:02:42.439 align:start position:0%
programs or failed uh the USMLE exam so
 
04:02:45.269 --> 04:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
um that's the pool of people you're
 
04:02:49.630 --> 04:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
looking at thank you that pretty clear
 
04:02:49.640 --> 04:02:50.990 align:start position:0%
looking at thank you that pretty clear
all

04:02:50.990 --> 04:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:02:55.790 --> 04:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
right no one else is here on this I'll
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
close the hearing and open the hearing
 
04:03:00.990 --> 04:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
04:03:07.070 --> 04:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:07.080 --> 04:03:27.349 align:start position:0%
 
McGee

04:03:27.349 --> 04:03:27.359 align:start position:0%

again I'm representative cat McGee and
 
04:03:39.269 --> 04:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
I'm from Hillsboro 35 which is Hollis
 
04:03:43.389 --> 04:03:43.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to present HB 394 which is a
 
04:03:47.389 --> 04:03:47.399 align:start position:0%
bill that may be familiar to all of
 
04:03:51.870 --> 04:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
you um this bill came to us um its first
 
04:03:56.710 --> 04:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
time four iterations ago when I was um
 
04:03:58.950 --> 04:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
approached by a constituent of mine who
 
04:04:02.670 --> 04:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
is a music therapist in Hollis about the
 
04:04:06.269 --> 04:04:06.279 align:start position:0%
issue of having certification under
 
04:04:08.910 --> 04:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
professional lure in New
 
04:04:11.950 --> 04:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there have been subsequent
 
04:04:13.790 --> 04:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
hearings I went and looked up the
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
history the original bill was hb1 1286
 
04:04:18.830 --> 04:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh which passed the house but then was
 
04:04:20.990 --> 04:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
laid on the table in the senate in June
 
04:04:21.000 --> 04:04:21.750 align:start position:0%
laid on the table in the senate in June
of

04:04:21.750 --> 04:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:04:24.710 --> 04:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
2020 um it was removed from the table in
 
04:04:27.670 --> 04:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
September of 2020 and it and then there
 
04:04:30.950 --> 04:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
was HB 209 which was a split vote on
 
04:04:32.990 --> 04:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
this committee and went to
 
04:04:37.990 --> 04:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
itl um and then HB 532 this last year
 
04:04:41.830 --> 04:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
year of this session um there was work
 
04:04:43.910 --> 04:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
and amendments on the larger Bill and
 
04:04:46.269 --> 04:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
all appeared to be a go and then it died
 
04:04:49.149 --> 04:04:49.159 align:start position:0%
on June 27th without all the signatures
 
04:04:52.670 --> 04:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
um after a committee of conference so
 
04:04:54.670 --> 04:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
there was a question whether we wanted
 
04:04:57.950 --> 04:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
to um present the bill again but in
 
04:05:00.309 --> 04:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
speaking again with the music therapists
 
04:05:01.990 --> 04:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
who've been participating in this
 
04:05:04.750 --> 04:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
process all along they nothing has
 
04:05:07.990 --> 04:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
changed for them and I thought maybe
 
04:05:09.750 --> 04:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
what would be helpful is to sort of
 
04:05:13.070 --> 04:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
present to you the Dilemma that they are
 
04:05:15.630 --> 04:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
confronting in their profession so I
 
04:05:18.110 --> 04:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
went and looked up the music therapy
 
04:05:20.429 --> 04:05:20.439 align:start position:0%
board certification website has some
 
04:05:24.309 --> 04:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
information about um you know where the
 
04:05:28.590 --> 04:05:28.600 align:start position:0%
profession is at with uh Statewide
 
04:05:31.550 --> 04:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
certifications and also why they why
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
they're needed so um I just offer for
 
04:05:38.469 --> 04:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
you today this very brief
 
04:05:40.910 --> 04:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
blurb which is that a national
 
04:05:43.110 --> 04:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
certification is not enough in Most
 
04:05:45.349 --> 04:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
states and this is the result of a
 
04:05:48.189 --> 04:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
policy shift over the past 10 to 15
 
04:05:50.030 --> 04:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
years as the federal government has
 
04:05:53.790 --> 04:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
moved away from regulation or have been
 
04:05:55.990 --> 04:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
deregulating and they've allocated that
 
04:05:58.590 --> 04:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
regul regulatory control to the state
 
04:06:02.950 --> 04:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
level so uh in many uh in addition many
 
04:06:05.950 --> 04:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
existing state regulations require that
 
04:06:08.590 --> 04:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
education and health care providers hold
 
04:06:11.349 --> 04:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
a state license so that shifting
 
04:06:13.469 --> 04:06:13.479 align:start position:0%
landscape is the reason that they were
 
04:06:15.429 --> 04:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
brought forward to say we you know we
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
really would like you to consider giving
 
04:06:19.750 --> 04:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
us the ability to be part of the Allied
 
04:06:22.110 --> 04:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
Health Care under the state state
 
04:06:23.990 --> 04:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
certification and
 
04:06:26.750 --> 04:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
lure so as a result many current and
 
04:06:29.189 --> 04:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
potential clients are having difficulty
 
04:06:31.189 --> 04:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
accessing Music Therapy
 
04:06:33.910 --> 04:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
Services um within educational and
 
04:06:36.429 --> 04:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
healthc Care Facilities which is where
 
04:06:39.030 --> 04:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
most of the Consulting work is provided
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
so that's sort of an access point um and
 
04:06:45.469 --> 04:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
then of course insurers are don't have
 
04:06:47.469 --> 04:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
them listed in their drop- down menus
 
04:06:50.030 --> 04:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
for folks to choose in terms of a
 
04:06:52.990 --> 04:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
specific Allied therapy and the
 
04:06:56.269 --> 04:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
inability for people to choose um them
 
04:06:58.389 --> 04:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
from that list also prohibits them from
 
04:07:00.630 --> 04:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
being reimbursed under insurance so
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
there are you know multiple issues in
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
terms of them using their professional
 
04:07:06.870 --> 04:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
licenses here in the state of New
 
04:07:06.880 --> 04:07:09.110 align:start position:0%
licenses here in the state of New
Hampshire

04:07:09.110 --> 04:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:07:11.429 --> 04:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
um so that's a little bit about the
 
04:07:15.389 --> 04:07:15.399 align:start position:0%
history and then on the bill itself uh
 
04:07:19.630 --> 04:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
as you all know in last year's session
 
04:07:22.510 --> 04:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
um there were some changes to the
 
04:07:26.910 --> 04:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
oplc um statute and uh some stuff was
 
04:07:30.990 --> 04:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
moved around so uh OS had a good time
 
04:07:33.269 --> 04:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
when I resubmitted the most recent
 
04:07:37.990 --> 04:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to them for reworking and they
 
04:07:40.030 --> 04:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
have updated uh the bill that you have
 
04:07:42.990 --> 04:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
in front of you so that it is current
 
04:07:46.229 --> 04:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
with the oplc statute as it stands today
 
04:07:46.239 --> 04:07:47.189 align:start position:0%
with the oplc statute as it stands today
and

04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:53.030 --> 04:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
basically it's giving um giving the um
 
04:07:56.229 --> 04:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
the format to adding them into Allied
 
04:07:57.670 --> 04:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
health professionals that they would
 
04:08:01.510 --> 04:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
require in statute and um has all of the
 
04:08:04.590 --> 04:08:04.600 align:start position:0%
changes that have been worked on and
 
04:08:06.670 --> 04:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
considered over the several years that
 
04:08:08.910 --> 04:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
they've been attempting to do this so
 
04:08:11.349 --> 04:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
there are definitions here as to what
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
music therapy entails What It Is What It
 
04:08:17.870 --> 04:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
Isn't that it doesn't um it doesn't uh
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
infringe in any other type of therapy
 
04:08:24.429 --> 04:08:24.439 align:start position:0%
that may be similar I know the um audio
 
04:08:27.269 --> 04:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
speech therapy folks had some concerns
 
04:08:29.070 --> 04:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
around language they brought in language
 
04:08:31.510 --> 04:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
that had been used in other states um
 
04:08:33.990 --> 04:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
and there are currently about 36% of the
 
04:08:37.830 --> 04:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
states so 18 states right now uh have
 
04:08:41.309 --> 04:08:41.319 align:start position:0%
music uh certified music therapy as an
 
04:08:43.870 --> 04:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
Allied Health in the state so we're just
 
04:08:46.990 --> 04:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
um trying to help these folks uh get
 
04:08:49.349 --> 04:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
where they need to be and for those of
 
04:08:51.630 --> 04:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
you I don't know how long all of you
 
04:08:52.750 --> 04:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
have been on the committee I know some
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
of you have been here the whole time um
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was very
 
04:08:58.189 --> 04:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
interesting to me because I knew very
 
04:09:00.630 --> 04:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
little about music therapy when I
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
started this road with this
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
constituent um in the very first hearing
 
04:09:08.189 --> 04:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
she brought a former
 
04:09:11.950 --> 04:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
patient that she had worked with and he
 
04:09:13.630 --> 04:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
is now an adult he was a child when she
 
04:09:19.510 --> 04:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
met him he was um born blind and he is
 
04:09:22.269 --> 04:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
now um an inspirational speaker and he
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
was very inspirational the day that he
 
04:09:26.510 --> 04:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
came to the hearing but what was amazing
 
04:09:30.710 --> 04:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
was that um his parents were they had a
 
04:09:32.830 --> 04:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
lot of difficulty trying to figure out
 
04:09:36.030 --> 04:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
how to reach him so I liken it to sort
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
of The Miracle Worker right you have to
 
04:09:39.750 --> 04:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
to fix the you have to figure out the
 
04:09:43.149 --> 04:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
right key in order to reach certain
 
04:09:47.070 --> 04:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
people and um and once you do bridge
 
04:09:48.990 --> 04:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
that Gap and do figure out how to reach
 
04:09:52.030 --> 04:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
those people um then you can have the
 
04:09:53.630 --> 04:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
kind of success that he had in his life
 
04:09:56.149 --> 04:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
and he came in to the hearing to give
 
04:09:58.790 --> 04:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
this committee that information and I
 
04:10:00.309 --> 04:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
was really impressed I didn't know he
 
04:10:02.149 --> 04:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
was coming um and I didn't of course
 
04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
know him but um I think since that time
 
04:10:08.950 --> 04:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
the therapists them eles have come in on
 
04:10:11.870 --> 04:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
several occasions both for work sessions
 
04:10:14.510 --> 04:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
and also um to provide the committee
 
04:10:15.670 --> 04:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
with additional
 
04:10:18.229 --> 04:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
information I think they're all sort of
 
04:10:20.950 --> 04:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
working today and so uh when we talked
 
04:10:22.510 --> 04:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
about them coming it was in the midst of
 
04:10:25.429 --> 04:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
the snowstorm and I think they are very
 
04:10:28.349 --> 04:10:28.359 align:start position:0%
hopeful that you know there has been
 
04:10:30.590 --> 04:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
there have been tears uh when the bill
 
04:10:32.429 --> 04:10:32.439 align:start position:0%
hasn't gone through before but I think
 
04:10:35.830 --> 04:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
they're also um they're reluctant to
 
04:10:37.790 --> 04:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
Hope at this point but I am here to
 
04:10:41.189 --> 04:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
represent them and ask that you continue
 
04:10:44.510 --> 04:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
to um give this your due consideration
 
04:10:47.910 --> 04:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
because I understand that there um may
 
04:10:50.550 --> 04:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
be sentiments against having lots of
 
04:10:52.590 --> 04:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
certifications or so many certifications
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
or adding to
 
04:10:56.389 --> 04:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
certifications but this is a legitimate
 
04:11:01.269 --> 04:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
form of therapy and um and we have you
 
04:11:02.870 --> 04:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
know I have talked to people who have
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
benefited from it so that's how I've
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
come to that
 
04:11:09.389 --> 04:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
conclusion and I think that if we are
 
04:11:11.630 --> 04:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
not allowing them to to participate with
 
04:11:12.990 --> 04:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
other forms of
 
04:11:18.389 --> 04:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
therapy um then we are
 
04:11:21.870 --> 04:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
um I think it's we're unduly picking
 
04:11:24.870 --> 04:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
those who can participate in insurance
 
04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
and those who can't so um so I don't
 
04:11:30.269 --> 04:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
have any more information about the
 
04:11:32.269 --> 04:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
profession itself and and I think you
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
have probably heard a significant amount
 
04:11:36.269 --> 04:11:36.279 align:start position:0%
of testimony on that on this committee
 
04:11:38.429 --> 04:11:38.439 align:start position:0%
so if I can be of any assistance
 
04:11:40.149 --> 04:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
answering any questions I will do my
 
04:11:41.830 --> 04:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
best to do that and that'll just
 
04:11:45.429 --> 04:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony okay are there
 
04:11:48.790 --> 04:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative man prudy
 
04:11:50.309 --> 04:11:50.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry madam
 
04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
chair uh being a speech pathologist in
 
04:11:56.950 --> 04:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
my past life and music therapy was a
 
04:12:00.710 --> 04:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
huge Avenue for people with aasia one
 
04:12:02.870 --> 04:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
very well-known case is the
 
04:12:06.030 --> 04:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
congresswoman Gabby gford her regaining
 
04:12:09.750 --> 04:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
of speech was is through music therapy
 
04:12:13.269 --> 04:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
and there are several uh instances where
 
04:12:16.710 --> 04:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
I've used that for people with Autism to
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
break through for
 
04:12:20.710 --> 04:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
communication and this is only with
 
04:12:23.269 --> 04:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
people who are diagnosed
 
04:12:27.309 --> 04:12:27.319 align:start position:0%
with speech or communication disorder
 
04:12:31.590 --> 04:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
earlier but music therapy can be very
 
04:12:36.070 --> 04:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
beneficial for hum other situations who
 
04:12:39.389 --> 04:12:39.399 align:start position:0%
are trained so have you had opportunity
 
04:12:42.630 --> 04:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
to get those and the music therapists
 
04:12:45.030 --> 04:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
they're not just music teachers have you
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
got input from music therapist
 
04:12:50.510 --> 04:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
particularly on other than speech and
 
04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
communication disorder group that could
 
04:12:55.590 --> 04:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
benefit like one was the blind or was
 
04:12:59.550 --> 04:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
the other ones yeah I think
 
04:13:02.910 --> 04:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
um I think the overlap between speech
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
therapy and and music therapy has to do
 
04:13:10.870 --> 04:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
with communication issues in children
 
04:13:14.510 --> 04:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
and adults and I think most people
 
04:13:18.030 --> 04:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
understand that music has a unique space
 
04:13:20.469 --> 04:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of how people connect to music
 
04:13:22.229 --> 04:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
and in some cases they connect to music
 
04:13:25.389 --> 04:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
and and little else um but again I'm I'm
 
04:13:27.349 --> 04:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
not an expert I'm not I didn't know that
 
04:13:29.429 --> 04:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
you were in speech therapy so that's
 
04:13:35.830 --> 04:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
interesting um I do know that um it is a
 
04:13:38.550 --> 04:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
therapy that in certain instances is
 
04:13:41.469 --> 04:13:41.479 align:start position:0%
unique in terms of how it can help
 
04:13:44.990 --> 04:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
someone um overcome any any number of
 
04:13:47.269 --> 04:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
disabilities educational disabilities
 
04:13:49.389 --> 04:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
learning disabilities that kind of thing
 
04:13:52.269 --> 04:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
so um you're right I think a lot of
 
04:13:55.790 --> 04:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
people conflate just being able to play
 
04:13:58.710 --> 04:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
music or participate in music and I
 
04:14:00.590 --> 04:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
think part of that language is in the
 
04:14:04.429 --> 04:14:04.439 align:start position:0%
bill stating what music therapists do
 
04:14:07.950 --> 04:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
how they collaborate how they determine
 
04:14:10.790 --> 04:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
um appropriate courses of care and they
 
04:14:13.550 --> 04:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
document goals and they achieve those
 
04:14:15.109 --> 04:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
goals through the therapy so like any
 
04:14:18.950 --> 04:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
other therapy um
 
04:14:21.670 --> 04:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
so that's about all I can
 
04:14:25.269 --> 04:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
say all right
 
04:14:29.389 --> 04:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
um I think that's it y
 
04:14:31.830 --> 04:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative Roy oh excuse me
 
04:14:31.840 --> 04:14:32.950 align:start position:0%
okay representative Roy oh excuse me
representative

04:14:32.950 --> 04:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:14:36.590 --> 04:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
schmith thank you mam pure uh good
 
04:14:36.600 --> 04:14:37.590 align:start position:0%
schmith thank you mam pure uh good
afternoon

04:14:37.590 --> 04:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
present so th this bill that you're
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
presenting to us today is the identical
 
04:14:45.429 --> 04:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
bill that has passed this Committee in
 
04:14:47.109 --> 04:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
the most recent
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
iteration based on the the
 
04:14:55.870 --> 04:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh um the collaboration with the speech
 
04:14:58.670 --> 04:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
pathologists and and uh the the
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
agreement they the the
 
04:15:05.149 --> 04:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
two uh practices came to to resolve the
 
04:15:07.830 --> 04:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
issue that did hang us up
 
04:15:10.349 --> 04:15:10.359 align:start position:0%
three or four years ago right yes so
 
04:15:13.510 --> 04:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
this version is the one that was was
 
04:15:15.710 --> 04:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
adopted by the house in the last go
 
04:15:18.790 --> 04:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
round correct yes latest and greatest
 
04:15:20.950 --> 04:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
all the bells and whistles and also
 
04:15:23.830 --> 04:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
updated again for the oplc changes um
 
04:15:26.469 --> 04:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
because I I went back and forth with uh
 
04:15:29.149 --> 04:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
Patrick Conroy I believe it is in OS he
 
04:15:31.269 --> 04:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
was very helpful in saying well this the
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
section's gone so you can't refer to
 
04:15:35.149 --> 04:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
that so you know he so he updated it so
 
04:15:37.189 --> 04:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
that it is it is accurate and it
 
04:15:40.750 --> 04:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
contains all of the work group product
 
04:15:42.590 --> 04:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
that uh this committee brought to the
 
04:15:46.790 --> 04:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
bill um in in its last iterations um
 
04:15:49.229 --> 04:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
followup thank followup so so as you
 
04:15:51.870 --> 04:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
know I have a I think she's not
 
04:15:54.630 --> 04:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
technically a constituent of mine in do
 
04:15:57.309 --> 04:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
because um she lives in the South End
 
04:16:00.349 --> 04:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
and I represent the central area but um
 
04:16:01.990 --> 04:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
Marissa is her first name I'm sure
 
04:16:03.910 --> 04:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
you've spoken with her many times do you
 
04:16:05.510 --> 04:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
know whether she's watching the hearing
 
04:16:07.950 --> 04:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
again today I would imagine she is if
 
04:16:10.269 --> 04:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
she's able okay well perhaps we'll see
 
04:16:11.670 --> 04:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
that and I believe representative Roy
 
04:16:14.109 --> 04:16:14.119 align:start position:0%
spoke with her this morning well she was
 
04:16:16.750 --> 04:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
cheering us on he'll speak to to that I
 
04:16:18.670 --> 04:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
I spoke with her relatively recently and
 
04:16:21.429 --> 04:16:21.439 align:start position:0%
she's still very hopeful I believe so I
 
04:16:23.070 --> 04:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
guess representative Roy will tell us
 
04:16:25.149 --> 04:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your advocacy
 
04:16:27.710 --> 04:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
and you can count on me to be voting yes
 
04:16:32.149 --> 04:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:34.630 --> 04:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you representative McGee
 
04:16:48.030 --> 04:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:49.790 --> 04:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you representative
 
04:16:53.870 --> 04:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
Terry Roy Rockingham District 31 um I'm
 
04:16:56.590 --> 04:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
here as a co-sponsor today of this
 
04:16:59.269 --> 04:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
bill as uh the previous speaker told you
 
04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
I know this has been here several
 
04:17:03.309 --> 04:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
several times
 
04:17:06.189 --> 04:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
um uh like all of you I wear a couple
 
04:17:07.990 --> 04:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
hats around here here one of them is the
 
04:17:10.510 --> 04:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
chairman of the veterans interest caucus
 
04:17:12.550 --> 04:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
and my interest in this bill was laser
 
04:17:14.550 --> 04:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
focused on Veterans um and what it can
 
04:17:17.309 --> 04:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
do for veterans when I first heard about
 
04:17:19.750 --> 04:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
music therapy I also maybe like many of
 
04:17:21.189 --> 04:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
you thought it was some kind of strange
 
04:17:24.030 --> 04:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
snake oil thing um when I heard music
 
04:17:26.429 --> 04:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
therapy what the heck is that so I did
 
04:17:28.510 --> 04:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
my research on it the Department of
 
04:17:30.189 --> 04:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
Defense and particularly the US Army has
 
04:17:33.030 --> 04:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
been using m music therapy since
 
04:17:36.910 --> 04:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
1945 it's a well-established thing um
 
04:17:38.550 --> 04:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
they sent out a technical bulletin in
 
04:17:40.429 --> 04:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
1945 on the
 
04:17:42.670 --> 04:17:42.680 align:start position:0%
programming uh program for the use of
 
04:17:44.389 --> 04:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
reconditioning among service members
 
04:17:46.189 --> 04:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
cesing in the Army
 
04:17:49.910 --> 04:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals since 2000 um specifically
 
04:17:53.349 --> 04:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
around 2005 the VA has doubled the
 
04:17:55.269 --> 04:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
number of Music therapists that work at
 
04:17:55.279 --> 04:17:56.109 align:start position:0%
number of Music therapists that work at
the

04:17:56.109 --> 04:17:56.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:17:59.189 --> 04:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
VA um so the Veterans Administration
 
04:18:01.469 --> 04:18:01.479 align:start position:0%
takes this therapy very seriously and
 
04:18:04.269 --> 04:18:04.279 align:start position:0%
they use it a lot the problem our
 
04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
constituents have in New Hampshire is
 
04:18:08.950 --> 04:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
that although we have a medical center
 
04:18:10.710 --> 04:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
in Manchester it's not what's called in
 
04:18:14.149 --> 04:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
the VA Parliament a full service medical
 
04:18:15.830 --> 04:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
so they don't have all the type of
 
04:18:17.550 --> 04:18:17.560 align:start position:0%
things that you might find at a bigger
 
04:18:20.630 --> 04:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
VA hospital to include music therapists
 
04:18:22.790 --> 04:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
so veterans in New Hampshire who may
 
04:18:25.030 --> 04:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
benefit from this have to seek what's
 
04:18:27.830 --> 04:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
called Community Care and to do that
 
04:18:29.469 --> 04:18:29.479 align:start position:0%
they have to use a licensed music
 
04:18:32.910 --> 04:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
therapist which we do not have in New
 
04:18:36.070 --> 04:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our veterans really can use
 
04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
this and I like many of you am not a fan
 
04:18:41.630 --> 04:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
of just handing out licenses for
 
04:18:43.469 --> 04:18:43.479 align:start position:0%
everything that might possibly want or
 
04:18:46.469 --> 04:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
have a license but this is an
 
04:18:50.870 --> 04:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
established um well researched um form
 
04:18:54.790 --> 04:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
of care for people that is not
 
04:18:57.550 --> 04:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
experimental it it's been used for many
 
04:18:59.830 --> 04:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
many decades and I feel that it
 
04:19:02.550 --> 04:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
justifies ler so that these people can
 
04:19:04.269 --> 04:19:04.279 align:start position:0%
do this and provide this service for our
 
04:19:06.910 --> 04:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
veterans and get paid to do it with
 
04:19:09.469 --> 04:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
regard to what music therapy does I'm
 
04:19:11.189 --> 04:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
just going to read something real quick
 
04:19:12.950 --> 04:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
and it'll conclude my
 
04:19:15.309 --> 04:19:15.319 align:start position:0%
testimony music therapy has been proven
 
04:19:17.149 --> 04:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
to help with a whole He of health
 
04:19:19.109 --> 04:19:19.119 align:start position:0%
problems it can assist with physical
 
04:19:20.990 --> 04:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation help people learn to
 
04:19:23.790 --> 04:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
speak again improve communication skills
 
04:19:25.790 --> 04:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
and help people manage negative emotions
 
04:19:28.389 --> 04:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
and combat depression anxiety all of
 
04:19:31.109 --> 04:19:31.119 align:start position:0%
these things that might benefit veterans
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
this is I'm reading from a VA thing when
 
04:19:35.950 --> 04:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
you listen to music your ear collects
 
04:19:37.590 --> 04:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
sound waves and and funnels them to your
 
04:19:39.750 --> 04:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
inner ear where they are converted to
 
04:19:41.710 --> 04:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
electrical signals those electrical
 
04:19:43.950 --> 04:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
signals then travel through your brain
 
04:19:45.389 --> 04:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
stimulating different parts of your
 
04:19:48.309 --> 04:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
brain to cause different reactions music
 
04:19:49.750 --> 04:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
stimulates the parts of your brain
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
associated with memory emotion vocal
 
04:19:54.229 --> 04:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
imitation and movement among other
 
04:19:56.830 --> 04:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
things as a result music can affect the
 
04:19:58.710 --> 04:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
functioning of those parts of the brain
 
04:20:01.870 --> 04:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
on the body meaning that can have a real
 
04:20:04.189 --> 04:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
physiological effects since music
 
04:20:06.630 --> 04:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
stimulates the cerebrum which is
 
04:20:08.590 --> 04:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
associated with memory it can also help
 
04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
your memory sharp keep it sharp which
 
04:20:13.750 --> 04:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
may be useful for veterans struggling
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
with brain injuries or PTSD induced
 
04:20:19.550 --> 04:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
Amnesia while music stimulates the lyic
 
04:20:21.149 --> 04:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
system which is responsible for
 
04:20:23.550 --> 04:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
emotional responses it has also been
 
04:20:25.750 --> 04:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
shown to help suppress negative emotions
 
04:20:28.389 --> 04:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
while elevating positive ones this can
 
04:20:30.189 --> 04:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
be incredibly useful in modulating
 
04:20:32.590 --> 04:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
feelings of depression and
 
04:20:34.750 --> 04:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
anxiety the physical and cognitive
 
04:20:36.590 --> 04:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
benefits of music therapy are also
 
04:20:39.510 --> 04:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
manifold and always growing since music
 
04:20:40.710 --> 04:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
affects the parts of the brain
 
04:20:42.149 --> 04:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
responsible for the movement and
 
04:20:44.550 --> 04:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
communication it can assist with
 
04:20:46.309 --> 04:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
physical or speech
 
04:20:48.269 --> 04:20:48.279 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation human beings have an
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
Impulse to move with rhythms and when
 
04:20:52.030 --> 04:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
you pair listening to music with
 
04:20:54.670 --> 04:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
practicing a specific movement over and
 
04:20:58.030 --> 04:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
over like clapping or taking a step that
 
04:20:59.990 --> 04:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
movement can get more fluid and become
 
04:21:02.149 --> 04:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
ingrained in your muscle memory music
 
04:21:03.990 --> 04:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
therapists have been using this method
 
04:21:06.790 --> 04:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
to help chair-bound or bedbound veterans
 
04:21:09.030 --> 04:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
get back on their feet for years it is
 
04:21:11.070 --> 04:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
certainly useful for wounded
 
04:21:13.149 --> 04:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
veterans keeping in mind we're still
 
04:21:16.469 --> 04:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
fighting a uh an epidemic of 22 veteran
 
04:21:19.429 --> 04:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
suicides A Day in the United States I
 
04:21:20.670 --> 04:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
would hope that the committee would take
 
04:21:22.590 --> 04:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
that into account and look at the
 
04:21:24.349 --> 04:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
possibility of using this to help our
 
04:21:26.309 --> 04:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
veterans in Hampshire gain further
 
04:21:28.469 --> 04:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
access to that and I'm willing to take
 
04:21:30.670 --> 04:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you for your time
 
04:21:32.670 --> 04:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
thank you are there
 
04:21:34.950 --> 04:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
questions yes thank you I'm seeing as
 
04:21:36.790 --> 04:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
someone else give us someone else a
 
04:21:39.229 --> 04:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
chance first representative man
 
04:21:43.469 --> 04:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
py thank you madam chair so um the
 
04:21:46.750 --> 04:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
Jamaica plane or Roxberry VA Center has
 
04:21:50.950 --> 04:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
a very well established music therap MIT
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's called music internation therapy
 
04:21:56.269 --> 04:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
have you been able to get that
 
04:21:58.630 --> 04:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
information very well formed this was
 
04:22:00.990 --> 04:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
1945 they've done a lot of study with
 
04:22:01.000 --> 04:22:02.030 align:start position:0%
1945 they've done a lot of study with
the

04:22:02.030 --> 04:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:22:06.510 --> 04:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
veterans that has given a very credible
 
04:22:08.750 --> 04:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
thing with yeah they they use it down
 
04:22:10.790 --> 04:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
there at the Jamaica plane one um
 
04:22:12.189 --> 04:22:12.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's quite a hike for a
 
04:22:13.910 --> 04:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
lot of our veterans and they just they
 
04:22:15.670 --> 04:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
can't get down there and there are a lot
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
of people in in places up here where
 
04:22:18.710 --> 04:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
they could get it if we could just get
 
04:22:22.149 --> 04:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
them licensed thank representative
 
04:22:24.510 --> 04:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
Gart I just thought of something is
 
04:22:26.109 --> 04:22:26.119 align:start position:0%
there a remote
 
04:22:29.109 --> 04:22:29.119 align:start position:0%
option um sometimes sometimes not it
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
depends on the therapy what what they're
 
04:22:33.229 --> 04:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
being treated for it's not always
 
04:22:34.750 --> 04:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
something you could do just over the
 
04:22:36.389 --> 04:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
Internet because of the the actual
 
04:22:38.469 --> 04:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
vibrations you feel from the music even
 
04:22:39.870 --> 04:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
if you're using it to walk and things
 
04:22:43.309 --> 04:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
like that to pick up motor skills um
 
04:22:45.309 --> 04:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'm not really sure so I don't
 
04:22:46.990 --> 04:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
want to speculate but everything I've
 
04:22:49.309 --> 04:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
seen is it's been in person and there's
 
04:22:51.469 --> 04:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
also the issue of Licensing cross state
 
04:22:54.630 --> 04:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
lines and billing and things like that
 
04:22:56.870 --> 04:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:22:58.910 --> 04:22:58.920 align:start position:0%

counsel oplc my testimony is the same as
 
04:23:20.109 --> 04:23:20.119 align:start position:0%
last time I found a couple of uh
 
04:23:21.950 --> 04:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
discrepancies between the language as
 
04:23:24.510 --> 04:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
proposed and the language in 310 and I'm
 
04:23:26.149 --> 04:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
just offering my services to clean that
 
04:23:29.149 --> 04:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
up should the committee decide to move
 
04:23:31.830 --> 04:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
forward okay so we should not move it
 
04:23:34.510 --> 04:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
forward without cleaning up the language
 
04:23:36.870 --> 04:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions
 
04:23:39.750 --> 04:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
