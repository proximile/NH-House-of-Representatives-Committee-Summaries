most everyone remember to set their
 
00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:25.670 align:start position:0%
most everyone remember to set their
clocks

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
clocks
 
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
um I know I almost didn't luckily these
 
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
newfangled phones they do it for you so
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
alarm went off as a as anticipated uh

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
House Bill 639 for the record Jason
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
Candia and Deerfield they changed my
 
00:08:48.009 --> 00:08:48.019 align:start position:0%
towns sometimes they're hard to remember
 
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
relative to the legalization and
 
00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
regulation of cannabis I see someone
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
brought us some samples over on the
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
table there
 
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
um so I hope you all enjoy
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh I just want to give you a quick
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
overview of where this bill came from
 
00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
the Commerce chairman is coming up right
 
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
behind me to talk to you a little bit
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
more about some of the details that we
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
did over there to some might say refine
 
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
others might have other words to
 
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
describe what we did
 
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
um if you remember last year uh we uh
 
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Abbas sponsored a
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
legalization bill that was uh quite
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
different than what we have attempted in
 
00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:29.779 align:start position:0%
the past it uh possibility of running
 
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
Cannabis stores uh much like they do uh
 
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
with liquor today and if you'll remember
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
if you were around last year there were
 
00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:40.019 align:start position:0%
very few of us who thought that was a
 
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
good idea the reason we did that was to
 
00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:46.019 align:start position:0%
appease some other
 
00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:47.030 align:start position:0%
appease some other
um

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
people that are in the legislative
 
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
production chain if you will and uh it
 
00:09:59.449 --> 00:09:59.459 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't quite work so this year
 
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
um over the summer a whole group of
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
interested parties got together to put
 
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
together uh the first draft of what you
 
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
have in front of you today and
 
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
um people from the industry uh people
 
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
from the recovery Community
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
um uh you have AFP on one side the ACLU
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
on another side everyone all working
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
together to try to
 
00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:26.459 align:start position:0%
um you know solve this problem that
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
we've been going back and forth on for a
 
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
year after year after year I'm sure you
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
you know the the house routinely passes
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
some kind of Bill like this every year
 
00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:38.339 align:start position:0%
in the other body uh routinely shuts it
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
down and uh so we would like to get get
 
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
this solved once once and for all
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
so what we did uh uh in Commerce uh we
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
have applied
 
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.150 align:start position:0%
have applied
um

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
some of the objections that we heard
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
from the other body last year
 
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
in that uh
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
things like they do not want to see
 
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
people growing uh themselves at home we
 
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.050 align:start position:0%
people growing uh themselves at home we
are

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
uh strongly convinced that that would be
 
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
a deal killer so that's out we don't
 
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
talk uh in this product
 
00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:19.019 align:start position:0%
um about annulling past offenses uh
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
that's a a topic that can be left for
 
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
another day
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
um the other uh big change two two big
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
changes one uh
 
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
the idea that was presented by the group
 
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:35.459 align:start position:0%
over the summer was that we would form a
 
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
brand new commission kind of like the
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission but a commission that
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
would deal just in in
 
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
and uh it was the uh the thought of the
 
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Committee that I'm sure
 
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
that the chairman will talk to you about
 
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
uh why reinvent the wheel we've already
 
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
got a commission a Liquor Commission
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's more than happy to take this on
 
00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.870 align:start position:0%
that's more than happy to take this on
and

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
um and rather than approach it like the
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
sale of liquor like we did with the bill
 
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
last year instead we're kind of treating
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
it like we do tobacco where we license
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh businesses to uh to sell and as well
 
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
as uh cultivate
 
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.590 align:start position:0%
as uh cultivate
um

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
we we hope that that addresses the
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
spirit of what was desired by giving
 
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
control of this new industry over to the
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission but um overcoming the
 
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
issues that
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
um some had with it
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
including myself such as uh not having
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
the state itself run
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
the stores and not employ the people
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
as well as having to front all the money
 
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
to build the stores right so there's no
 
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
there's there's no money allocated uh
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
for for building new stores it's all
 
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
around regulation licensing
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
the other big uh change that we made was
 
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
around the taxation uh the the idea that
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
was brought to us over the summer was to
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
attach cannabis to the rooms and meals
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
sales tax
 
00:13:18.769 --> 00:13:18.779 align:start position:0%
and uh there are various reasons for
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
one would be that there are a number of
 
00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
legislators who don't like creating new
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
taxes myself obviously included
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
um and so the idea was well if we just
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
attach it to an existing tax then we're
 
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
not creating a new tax
 
00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:38.459 align:start position:0%
um I I think at least speaking for
 
00:13:38.459 --> 00:13:39.470 align:start position:0%
um I I think at least speaking for
myself

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know you you don't need to find me a
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
loophole to to uh pretend like I'm not
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
creating a new tax when I am so um no
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
matter what we do we are going to be
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
extracting new Revenue uh from the
 
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
industry because it does not exist today
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
and I would look at it as um
 
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
you know not creating a new text but
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
replacing one because whether you like
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
it or not there is a tax on cannabis
 
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
today and it's an enforcement tax
 
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
because it exists in the black market
 
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
um the uh cost is baked in to the price
 
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
of the good of having to deal with
 
00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:26.579 align:start position:0%
avoiding uh law enforcement
 
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
it's just a simple supply and demand
 
00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
analysis right
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
so what we said was uh you know we we
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
also know that the the
 
00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:38.569 align:start position:0%
also know that the the
um

00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:38.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
the other body I won't name them uh it
 
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
does not like
 
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.430 align:start position:0%
does not like
um

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
meddling cannabis with the rooms and
 
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
meals tax the feeling is I've it's been
 
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
described to me as
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
the more things that we add on to that
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
tax the more it makes it look like a
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
general sales tax and people don't like
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
the look of that and I I can completely
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
respect that
 
00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:05.579 align:start position:0%
so what we did was we we looked at our
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
surrounding states how they do their
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
taxation we thought well why don't we
 
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
just do what Maine does and then you
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
know cut cut it in half and then we said
 
00:15:17.329 --> 00:15:17.339 align:start position:0%
uh well why why make it that complicated
 
00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:20.060 align:start position:0%
let's just have one single
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
tax on the cultivation level and the 15
 
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:26.540 align:start position:0%
that we came up with
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
would be about half of the total tax
 
00:15:32.769 --> 00:15:32.779 align:start position:0%
that our neighboring state of Maine
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
charges so um
 
00:15:38.449 --> 00:15:38.459 align:start position:0%
so that's a basic overview I know you're
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
here to talk about revenues and and
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
whatnot so um
 
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.210 align:start position:0%
whatnot so um
um

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
I would say uh whatever whatever uh you
 
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
guys uh do with this uh Bill going
 
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
forward my uh strong uh desire would be
 
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
that uh that we keep in uh compliance
 
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
costs and uh taxation as low as possible
 
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:04.100 align:start position:0%
right uh the the primary goal here is to
 
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
eliminate uh the black market to take
 
00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:09.899 align:start position:0%
these products out of the purview of
 
00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:12.779 align:start position:0%
gangsters and Thugs and put them into
 
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
the legitimate Marketplace to keep
 
00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
people safe and uh and to keep them
 
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
these products out of the hands of
 
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.870 align:start position:0%
these products out of the hands of
children

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
and keep adults who are using them as uh
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
as safe as possible and you can only do
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
that in a um in a transparent and uh and
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
well-regulated uh market so I'm happy to
 
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
take any questions if you have any or uh
 
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
let the uh the smart people go
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions yes
 
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions my
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
understanding that one of the the
 
00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:51.899 align:start position:0%
biggest uh Revenue generators so the
 
00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:53.959 align:start position:0%
edible con um
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
cannabis products and it seems to me
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
that on
 
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
page three
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh the definition of cannabis doesn't
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh cakes or or Foods or food ingredients
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
like that or even a cannabis infused
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
drinks so
 
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
our Edibles does this bill only apply to
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
joints or does or blunts or does it
 
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
apply to Edibles as well and where where
 
00:17:30.169 --> 00:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
am I missing that right if you skip over
 
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
to page four there's a definition of
 
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
cannabis products
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
well that's regular your but you're
 
00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
defining cannabis as not including and
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
okay I I hear that someone else can
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm wondering if
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
you can speak to the um production train
 
00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:03.539 align:start position:0%
chain that you're envisioning because
 
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
when I see that the proposed tax is on
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
the wholesale
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
product I'm not clear about where that
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
would be in the chain of developing the
 
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.990 align:start position:0%
would be in the chain of developing the
products

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes I I will uh let someone else
 
00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
speak to that as well but um
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
so there's a there's a cultivation then
 
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
there's Manufacturing and then there's
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
retail so this would be as it uh is
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
transferred from the cultivator to the
 
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.390 align:start position:0%
transferred from the cultivator to the
manufacturer

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
representative horse
 
00:18:42.049 --> 00:18:42.059 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question is there a reason why
 
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
we didn't tie it to the tobacco tax or
 
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
so I don't know why we uh didn't uh
 
00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.570 align:start position:0%
so I don't know why we uh didn't uh
um

00:18:59.570 --> 00:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
look at the tobacco tax in relation to
 
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
this but uh I think the the um
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
the thought process was uh start with
 
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
our neighbors and then cut it in half
 
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.789 align:start position:0%
our neighbors and then cut it in half
okay

00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you you say tax as little as
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
possible but you're using the 15 which
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
seems to be the highest number that
 
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
in the things that I've read that people
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
are using outside of California which is
 
00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:36.059 align:start position:0%
not selling very much marijuana because
 
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
no I I hear you uh but um you'll see
 
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
that these other states they have
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
multiple taxes at at all different
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
levels of uh the production so the 15 at
 
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
the wholesale I believe if you were to
 
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
convert that to a retail tax would be
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
something less like six and a half
 
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.049 align:start position:0%
something less like six and a half
percent

00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:00.059 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
just off top of my head
 
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
follow up on it's actually a separate
 
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
question have you talked to any calls
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
calls has the committee talked to any
 
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.350 align:start position:0%
calls has the committee talked to any
cultivators

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
cultivators
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
yes well that's interesting
 
00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:18.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative ulery
 
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for a second question and
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
maybe you can't answer this book but
 
00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:31.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
regulations that if the state Takes Over
 
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
Control of a controlled uh substance
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
like with alcohol
 
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
none of the well not them none of but
 
00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:48.419 align:start position:0%
the prohibitions that the federal
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
government has on individuals engaged in
 
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
this uh kind of uh disappear is
 
00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
is that the way it works
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
I I don't understand the question well
 
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
because you can't take uh credit card
 
00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
transactions or debit card transactions
 
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
because they go through a federal
 
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
banking system
 
00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
to in order to purchase some marijuana
 
00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
product it has to be a cash product
 
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
but if the state takes it over would
 
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
that prohibition go away would there be
 
00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059 align:start position:0%
some better uh I got you I I'll I'll
 
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
punt that question as well and I know
 
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
that there's good answers coming up for
 
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.289 align:start position:0%
that there's good answers coming up for
that

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:30.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your presentation and uh
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
what I was particularly interested in
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm particularly interested in as we
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
look at the bill is the movement from
 
00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:51.299 align:start position:0%
our rooms and meals tax to the tax on
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
the at the cultivator level
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and why and you you spoke to that and
 
00:21:59.570 --> 00:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
it has to do with the senates uh wanting
 
00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
to get this by the Senate as I
 
00:22:03.169 --> 00:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
understand it what I worry about is
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
whether it will it will work uh at the
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
cultivator level and I wonder if you've
 
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
explored that at all are you or you
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
share that concerns that's the concern I
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
looking at as we go through this yeah I
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
think the main concern off the top of my
 
00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:24.059 align:start position:0%
head at the cultivator level is what
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
happens when it is
 
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
the barriers are broken down federally
 
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
and now the product is being shipped in
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
from Iowa yeah and then how do we how do
 
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
we handle that and
 
00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting question yes I'll
 
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
be happy to hear what you come up with
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
oh representative
 
00:22:48.649 --> 00:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
so if we're legalizing this
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
in in allowing people to sell it we're
 
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
taking that sale out of the state's
 
00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.930 align:start position:0%
taking that sale out of the state's
control

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
why tax it at all
 
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
I mean these people that are selling are
 
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
going to pay business profits taxes
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
business enterprises taxes I mean this
 
00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
additional 15 percent I mean couldn't
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't we conceivably make an argument
 
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
that the businesses that are selling
 
00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:15.419 align:start position:0%
this are going to be wildly profitable
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we're going to get our money
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
in a different way
 
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
I like the way you think representative
 
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
um I happen to agree and uh if if you
 
00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
could find me uh you know 201 votes plus
 
00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
another uh 14 votes plus another uh
 
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.870 align:start position:0%
another uh 14 votes plus another uh
Governor

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
Governor
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
um I I would love to go along with that
 
00:23:35.159 --> 00:23:38.330 align:start position:0%
um I I would love to go along with that
10-4

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
all the questions for the representative
 
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
okay the chair will recognize uh
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.630 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning I am
 
00:23:57.049 --> 00:23:57.059 align:start position:0%
representative John Hunt representing
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
ringe and uh again I would say I I've
 
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:03.539 align:start position:0%
never done this before so this is this
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
is very interesting process uh generally
 
00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
when Commerce passes legislation we
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
generally do not have any new taxation
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
involved or new revenues involved having
 
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
said that I would say that uh this is
 
00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:21.059 align:start position:0%
the first time that this legislation has
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
come to Commerce and uh
 
00:24:27.409 --> 00:24:27.419 align:start position:0%
the way we looked at it in Commerce is
 
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
that our most important is not to
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel and that we did see
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
that we somewhat have the the model of
 
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission and our liquor
 
00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.049 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission and our liquor
statutes

00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:39.059 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
um and for better for worse I'm I have
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
to admit I'm one of the few people who
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
understands uh the Byzantine stack tax
 
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
structure uh and revenue structure of
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission and but it was
 
00:24:54.049 --> 00:24:54.059 align:start position:0%
really important that we did that to
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
apply to this legislation
 
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
and having said that many people think
 
00:25:00.529 --> 00:25:00.539 align:start position:0%
in terms of the liquor stores
 
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
and how that back when our forefathers
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
in 1934
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
created the commission after the
 
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
prohibition was repealed and their mind
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
was uh that the state should make the
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
profit the stake should make the revenue
 
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
and that model would would it was
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
obviously working very well but it was
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
based on the concept that um
 
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire didn't make any distilled
 
00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:30.299 align:start position:0%
Liquors at the time
 
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
and uh but other states did and other
 
00:25:36.049 --> 00:25:36.059 align:start position:0%
countries had wine
 
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
and so the idea was that the Liquor
 
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
Commission would buy it in bulk
 
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.130 align:start position:0%
Commission would buy it in bulk
and

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
sell it at retail and make a very large
 
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.750 align:start position:0%
sell it at retail and make a very large
margin

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
margin
 
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
and that model is still true today
 
00:25:54.529 --> 00:25:54.539 align:start position:0%
so when uh this marijuana bill showed up
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
in our committee the first thing I had
 
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
to learn is that no marijuana is not
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
coming from any other state or any other
 
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.269 align:start position:0%
coming from any other state or any other
country

00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
like we would do with liquor it has to
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
be manufactured grown cultivated within
 
00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
so that means this legislation is not
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
only trying to you know is going to be
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
doing something different it has to
 
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
create whole new Industries
 
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
and and then figure out how we're going
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
to license regulate them and ensure the
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
same same goals The Liquor Commission
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
has always had and when we uh in a
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
little Side Story
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
um the commission is also in charge of
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the tobacco laws and yes
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
believe it or not I was the chair of
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
that subcommittee Donna scitec when she
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
was speaker asked me to steer steer that
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation through to have the
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
commission also is the enforcement and
 
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
it really made sense because most of the
 
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
tobacco sellers were also selling beer
 
00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:09.299 align:start position:0%
and so therefore the two goals that we
 
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
have is which is not to serve anybody
 
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
who has over consumed
 
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
and more importantly not to serve it to
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
anybody under 21.
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
and taking that same goal same ideas of
 
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
what the commission does it made sense
 
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
for us to just add this new category
 
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
the legislation when it came over
 
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
created a whole new commission whole new
 
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
enforcement division whole new regulator
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
and and the Commerce Committee says well
 
00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:42.299 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's Reinventing the
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
wheel why why would we do that we
 
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
already have a Commission Now who again
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
they have you know the deputies they
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
have the hearings process they have all
 
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
those things already in place and the
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement to ensure that our licensees
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
comply why would you go out and create a
 
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
whole new new entity
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
but we knew we could not use the liquor
 
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
the the distilled wine model
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
because it's all coming from in-state so
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
then we looked over at the other model
 
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
that we have and that is how we deal
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
with beer in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
I go back to 1934 the wisdom of our
 
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
forefathers who at that point said well
 
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
we're just going to draw a line
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
and whether it's the right line or
 
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
number it's certainly been changed over
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
time but we're going to say anything
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
that is six percent or less alcohol
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
is going to be called a beverage
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
and it is not regulated to the
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
Commission in terms of the commission
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
selling it but the the commission still
 
00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:54.539 align:start position:0%
is uh enforcing the licensees
 
00:28:58.730 --> 00:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
the tax right now is 30 cents a gallon
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
and that is gallon not dollar value
 
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
which is interesting because I remember
 
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
when Steve Allen Court put in a bill
 
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
that said that we should be taxing it
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
based upon the value because he says
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
beer nowadays is getting more and more
 
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
expensive and we're leaving money on the
 
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
table because we're charging you know
 
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
logger we're charging the same tax rate
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
as a as a as a custom Brew but that bill
 
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:25.850 align:start position:0%
as a as a as a custom Brew but that bill
died

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
died
 
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
at any rate so it's always been 30 cents
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
in all the other states around us have
 
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
the same basic model of of a gallonage
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
tax it's not a very high tax
 
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
but what's interesting about that tax is
 
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
that that tax is collected by the beer
 
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
distributors Who are the middlemen
 
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
and we actually have in our statute
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:29:50.769 --> 00:29:50.779 align:start position:0%
we have a requirement that any licensee
 
00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
that can be other whether you're an
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
on-premise or off-premise licensee any
 
00:29:57.769 --> 00:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
licensee has to pay their bill their
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
beer bill
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
within 15 days
 
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:03.419 align:start position:0%
and the you know this means the state is
 
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
actually creating a statute that
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
requires you know so I'm going to have
 
00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:09.299 align:start position:0%
to pay their bills on time and why well
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
because in that tax in that bill is the
 
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.789 align:start position:0%
because in that tax in that bill is the
tax

00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:13.799 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
so this is nothing new with the idea of
 
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
requiring somebody who's an integral in
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
the process to collect the tax
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
and have it built into the product
 
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
so now we get to how we decided to do
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
this at the conservators level
 
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
okay if you say well this compared to
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
the Beer model or the beer model was the
 
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
beer manufacturer makes that beer but up
 
00:30:45.769 --> 00:30:45.779 align:start position:0%
until I passed a legislation many years
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
ago but allow beer distributors allow
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
beer manufacturers to self-distribute
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
believe it or not when we first created
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
the law for more than 40 years they had
 
00:30:57.049 --> 00:30:57.059 align:start position:0%
to go through a distributor you a beer
 
00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
manufacturer had to go through a
 
00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
distributor uh and maybe that's because
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
the distributor was the one who was
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
collecting the tax I'm not going to say
 
00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:07.940 align:start position:0%
that's why but that's just the history
 
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding is that when we changed
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
the law and we are now allow
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers to actually
 
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
produce actually that you buy a beer
 
00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
right there at their location
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
uh yes they're now collecting that 30
 
00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
cents a gallon tax and on top of that
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
because they're serving it to a customer
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
they do have to pay the the meals tax
 
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
obviously marijuana is not going to be
 
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
that way you cannot consume marijuana on
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
location we will never have an
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
on-premise licensee with marijuana
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
but what we can say is if you look at
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
the three tiers ironically it's three
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
tiers is that we have the cultivators
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
which are the people who are growing it
 
00:31:58.210 --> 00:31:58.220 align:start position:0%
this is the most highly regulated
 
00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:00.059 align:start position:0%
manufacturing business New Hampshire
 
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
would ever get into the ball in in terms
 
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
of who these people are one way they're
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
doing it because you know literally many
 
00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:09.419 align:start position:0%
states they actually have a little bar
 
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
code around every plant
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay now I don't know if we're going to
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
get to that point but the key element is
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
the commission is going to ensure that
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
that marijuana the Integrity of that
 
00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
marijuana being grown is maintained
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
inside that cultivator level
 
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
the cultivators will then sell it
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
in bag form or whatever in Bud form and
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
that is the manufacturing level
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing level can make
 
00:32:41.289 --> 00:32:41.299 align:start position:0%
brownies oh they're gone
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
brownies they can make gummies they can
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
roll joints they can do anything they
 
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
think in terms of
 
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
packaging the product
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
the product is then
 
00:32:59.210 --> 00:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
taken from there to a retailer
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
we do actually have in this 3G air we
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
have one another license in between
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
there we do license the trucks there
 
00:33:06.769 --> 00:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
will drive it deliver it
 
00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
okay but we do that now with our
 
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers we actually they
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
get a separate license to deliver it if
 
00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
they're going to be self-distributing
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
but here's the kicker
 
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
if you tax it at that cultivator level
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
we'll call it the you know the
 
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that base level
 
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
now you get it before shrinkage
 
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
we're gonna tax it right up front right
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
from before it leaves the door we're
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
going to have that tax
 
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know if we have it in the
 
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
rules now but maybe they'll get paid
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
within 15 days by whoever's buying it
 
00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:48.419 align:start position:0%
the manufacture or whatever that they're
 
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
going to get paid in a timely fashion
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
but we're going to tax it at that
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
beginning level because let's face it
 
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
there's going to be shrinkage when they
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
when that gets out of there in that form
 
00:34:02.049 --> 00:34:02.059 align:start position:0%
the bud form and gets into the kitchen
 
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
or wherever this you know whatever these
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
processors or whatever they're doing
 
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
back there's going to be shrinkage
 
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
we won't care because we'll have gotten
 
00:34:17.329 --> 00:34:17.339 align:start position:0%
our tax up front at the cultivator level
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
when we looked at this these numbers
 
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
what other states were doing and we say
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
and and I couldn't believe it some of
 
00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:26.339 align:start position:0%
these states are doing it by weight okay
 
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
30 cents a gallon okay they're doing it
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
by weight
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
well you know let's face it weight you
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
know can be how much moisture was
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
involved in the room or whatever but the
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
idea that you know now we need to bring
 
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh the department of weights and coming
 
00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:44.099 align:start position:0%
in not only we're going to check out gas
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
pumps but you know scales and
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
restaurants by now we're going to check
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
the scales and how there's I mean oh
 
00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:51.419 align:start position:0%
come on
 
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
that's that is not the New Hampshire way
 
00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:55.379 align:start position:0%
of doing something we want to keep it
 
00:34:59.089 --> 00:34:59.099 align:start position:0%
simple and straightforward so this way
 
00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:03.020 align:start position:0%
we're doing this is that 15 tax is on
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
the wholesale price as it's then sold
 
00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.410 align:start position:0%
the wholesale price as it's then sold
to

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:11.220 align:start position:0%
the middle the manufacturers the
 
00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.310 align:start position:0%
the middle the manufacturers the
processors

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
processors
 
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
so we're going to get the full value
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to get our 15 we don't care
 
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
what they end up doing it the
 
00:35:20.569 --> 00:35:20.579 align:start position:0%
manufacturer might
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
put a little away they might do who
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
knows what they do how efficient they
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
are I think they'll be pretty good at it
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think they're going to want
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
shrinkage but there may be some but more
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
importantly by the time it gets to the
 
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
retail level
 
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
it's already for the better word it's
 
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
already taxed is already baked in
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
and now all our retailers can advertise
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.089 --> 00:35:53.099 align:start position:0%
not that that was important to us that
 
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
was not the governor the governor that
 
00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
on this that made the most sent to us
 
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
sends to us was they're going of all the
 
00:36:02.089 --> 00:36:02.099 align:start position:0%
licensees the one you're going to have
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
the least amount of licensees
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
is going to be the cultivators
 
00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
and in this way we know those
 
00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
cultivators are highly regulated we're
 
00:36:13.849 --> 00:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
going to be keeping a lot of eyes on
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
what they're doing and what's going and
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
out of their buildings and so they're
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
because they're so highly regulated it
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
really makes sense for them to be the
 
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
one that collects the tax when they sell
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
it as a wholesale product to those
 
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.190 align:start position:0%
it as a wholesale product to those
manufacturers

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
the only other thing that I think my
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
this committee might have of purview
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
over is the fees of all these different
 
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
licensees and at this point and I'm sure
 
00:36:44.089 --> 00:36:44.099 align:start position:0%
you all know this and that is that the
 
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
fee any license fee should be a true
 
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
reflection of the departmental's costs
 
00:36:52.609 --> 00:36:52.619 align:start position:0%
to provide those licenses it is not a
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
profit Center
 
00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
so therefore we don't know how much the
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
fees the licensing fee should be at this
 
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
point in time because we don't know how
 
00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
many people are going to be getting into
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
the business we don't know the
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
denominator the numerator we still have
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
those numbers to work for and those are
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
in rules in this bill
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
so that's a player to be named later
 
00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
what those fees are I would say the
 
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
liquor in terms of the as the uh
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
legislature Commerce Committee we we
 
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
deal with these fees often enough to
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
know that it is a little complicated
 
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
because you want to vary the fee based
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
on how big of a production or how big of
 
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
an NT is so we actually
 
00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:38.099 align:start position:0%
um you know have we we say if you're
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
only going to be making a very small
 
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
allowed amount of beer or a small amount
 
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
of wine or the sale that our fee is
 
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
little is less
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
then if you're a big guy so that's
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
actually also again reflected in what
 
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
will happen in the rule making at the
 
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
end of the day any new cost to the
 
00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:59.750 align:start position:0%
end of the day any new cost to the
commission

00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
to implement this and enforce it will
 
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:05.339 align:start position:0%
obviously have to be baked into those
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
fees that will be determined later
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
and with that I will finish my testimony
 
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
that was very helpful thank you for
 
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
giving the broad overview and the
 
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
construct very helpful obviously we all
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
know that the construct has already
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
passed the house yes handedly so we're
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
going to be very focused on the revenue
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
and the taxation policy
 
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
can you talk to us a little bit about
 
00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:29.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
yeah I was originally
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
um we were at more like 10 we were
 
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
looking at other states again we're
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
looking at they're doing it by weight
 
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
a lot of the states
 
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
um Maine because they allow have home
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
cultivation they sell the plant it
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
sounds the starts so we we're you had to
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
kind of go through all those different
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
what they were doing and how they were
 
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
um so it did seem that most you know if
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
you were to get down to it that um 10 of
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
the cultivator level seem reasonable and
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
then five percent at the retail level
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
now obviously
 
00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:12.490 align:start position:0%
now obviously
um

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:12.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
the retail level now that's gonna at the
 
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
retail price so that's you know the
 
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
margin from the wholesale cost so we
 
00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
said well what the heck because of this
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
idea that it's much better to tax it
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
when we know we're getting the full
 
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.849 align:start position:0%
when we know we're getting the full
product

00:39:27.849 --> 00:39:27.859 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
untainted not worried about whether it's
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know got sugar mixed into it because
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's a brownie or or a gummy or whatever
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
that by taxing it at that cultivator
 
00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
level at the wholesale level
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
um it seemed that that a a good Revenue
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
number is just to take that five percent
 
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
move it over to the wholesale level now
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
obviously that's not true the same but
 
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
again it actually gives a little bit
 
00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
more Revenue but then when we start
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
applying that 15 and comparing it to
 
00:39:59.450 --> 00:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
other states it was clearly that it was
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
it was half of what other states are
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
collecting overall thank you one other
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
question I have before we send it around
 
00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
um where's the money go
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
so in the Builder has different sources
 
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
of where we where we spend the money
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
um and uh I mean obviously I I I have to
 
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
admit we did not Commerce did not touch
 
00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
that piece of the bill
 
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
that was what came forward from that
 
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
committee that was created to push the
 
00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:28.910 align:start position:0%
committee that was created to push the
legislation

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
um in the way we looked at in Commerce
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
was it should really just be pulled into
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
the same funds the way the Liquor
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
Commission is which is
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
um obviously that's General funds
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
um but then I guess in this legislation
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
it does talk about funding the pension
 
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
State Pension Plan and but always in any
 
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
case there is money carved out to deal
 
00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:56.099 align:start position:0%
with drug abuse and helping people for
 
00:40:58.970 --> 00:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
recovery so that is in this also in this
 
00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.050 align:start position:0%
recovery so that is in this also in this
legislation

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
hi and good morning good morning Dave
 
00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
um my neighbor to the south of Jaffrey
 
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:11.240 align:start position:0%
almost immediate neighbor
 
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:13.619 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with the revenue
 
00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
we have you know the 15 tax in this bill
 
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
we have a the only uh
 
00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
fiscal impacts
 
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
uh piece that I've seen was done by dra
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
various other agencies but dra was the
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
only one that looked at the tax issue
 
00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:38.339 align:start position:0%
and it looked at uh rooms and meals tax
 
00:41:41.089 --> 00:41:41.099 align:start position:0%
correct and um have you seen anything
 
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
has anybody done a uh an assessment of
 
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
what the 15 percent might uh
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
um I do know the liquor commissioner has
 
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
done some more details on those numbers
 
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
um for just you know discussion purposes
 
00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
so we compare ourselves to Maine
 
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
um you know they were their their sales
 
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
um they were bringing in close to 20
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year to the state
 
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
follow-up I guess it's not as a second
 
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
question well I'll ask it anyway
 
00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.050 align:start position:0%
question well I'll ask it anyway
um

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh yeah it's uh it's not the fiscal
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
impact yeah it's this question
 
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
um you said that this will be a tax on
 
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
the wholesale price as sold to the
 
00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
process processors
 
00:42:34.859 --> 00:42:35.770 align:start position:0%
process processors
um

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:35.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
and I guess that's okay it actually
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
speaks of gross revenues uh
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
realized by the processor it would be
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
the subject of the text but um what I'm
 
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:50.579 align:start position:0%
wondering about is how do you determine
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
that in the case of a vertically
 
00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.190 align:start position:0%
that in the case of a vertically
integrated

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
integrated
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
um Enterprise that's got all elements
 
00:42:59.329 --> 00:42:59.339 align:start position:0%
you know right that's why we're going
 
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
right to the beginning okay the the
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
cultivator the only thing the cultivator
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
is producing they're not doing it
 
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
they're not processing it now if they
 
00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:11.099 align:start position:0%
decide that they do they want to say
 
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
they want to be the full tier which back
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
in their forefathers didn't let that
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
happen with a three-tier system but
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
let's say we did then it simply as they
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
they have their calculation of how much
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
they're Distributing it to the their
 
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
other division that's processing it and
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
so that is where the tax would then be
 
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.569 align:start position:0%
so that is where the tax would then be
collected

00:43:34.569 --> 00:43:34.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
where was in a plot
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question I got two actually
 
00:43:44.809 --> 00:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:47.220 align:start position:0%
um less I have to I mean it's a little
 
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
Community because they do they have they
 
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
have multiple levels of Taxation plus
 
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
they then do a sales tax on top of it so
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
it's all over the it's it's multiple
 
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
levels of Taxation I I can't but it's
 
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
it's more than 20
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
20 and then when you add in the sales
 
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
I forgot the certainly just so you know
 
00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
I just was handed out uh some fiscal
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
notes so I will pass those out in a
 
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
moment um but we'll continue listening
 
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
to this representative representative
 
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am sure thank you chair
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
it must be high because there's a whole
 
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
bunch of rank here
 
00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.329 align:start position:0%
bunch of rank here
um

00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:32.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
just to characterize the taxation scheme
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
you would reverse that be a good because
 
00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
you're you don't have the step by
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
step-by-step tax increase you've got a
 
00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.390 align:start position:0%
step-by-step tax increase you've got a
tax

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
and then that tax is divided across all
 
00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
the products that are made so we have 15
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
cents here by the time it gets down to a
 
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
single item
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's a division of a division of a
 
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
division of that 15 cents
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
applied to the product would that be an
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
adequate characterization I had when I
 
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
was thinking of my testimony I was going
 
00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
to bring up the vat tax and I said well
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
that's I don't want to get in it's I'm a
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
little convoluted but I realized that
 
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
this is wasting means so you guys all
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
know what the vat tax is about but uh so
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
yes you're you're you're correct and
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
ma'am sure my other question
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
the the other question I ask is
 
00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.609 align:start position:0%
the the other question I ask is
you're

00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
defining cannabis in one place and it's
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
not a food product and then when you
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
define cannabis products it is a food
 
00:45:41.569 --> 00:45:41.579 align:start position:0%
product but you're using the word
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis and when you define the word
 
00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:47.180 align:start position:0%
cannabis it excludes food and then
 
00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:50.579 align:start position:0%
cannabis products includes food we need
 
00:45:52.809 --> 00:45:52.819 align:start position:0%
to get some
 
00:45:55.849 --> 00:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
uh if if there's some clarification
 
00:45:58.609 --> 00:45:58.619 align:start position:0%
there I I certainly now the problem we
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
had was it was an early bill so we were
 
00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
somewhat rushed to get it out so I know
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
that they're I've heard some some typos
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
and some references that need to be
 
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
cleaned up but which I have I would we
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
would consider that a very uh germane
 
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.870 align:start position:0%
would consider that a very uh germane

fellows
 
00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
good morning hey Sally nice to see you
 
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
um your your Committee of a Commerce and
 
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
Consumer Affairs
 
00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
did they give any consideration to
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
some kind of structure that keeps the
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
products with a lower THC potency
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
lower than the more potent
 
00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
products because you know I think some
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
some states have a tax system that taxes
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
at a lower rate for the ones with the
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
lower THC
 
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
or do you think that maybe that just
 
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
will kind of come out in the wash it
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
comes out in the price because of the
 
00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:08.220 align:start position:0%
the exactly products with the lower THC
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
you would anticipate would be exactly
 
00:47:14.089 --> 00:47:14.099 align:start position:0%
okay thank you did you did your
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
committee talk yes we did we didn't talk
 
00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
about that because uh um you know again
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
talking about others say some states
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
actually cap how much the size of it is
 
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
but you know at the end of the day it's
 
00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:28.140 align:start position:0%
how much your person's buying it so if
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
you're you're uh if you're they cap it
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
at five percent milligram five
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
milligrams and and you sell it at you
 
00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
sell 20 of them now that's no different
 
00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
than if you had it at 10 milligrams and
 
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
you only sold 10 of them but then the
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
price obviously it reflects the
 
00:47:45.359 --> 00:47:46.970 align:start position:0%
price obviously it reflects the
differences

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
differences
 
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.010 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time finding a farmer
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
in this state that is willing to
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
participate in this I think when you met
 
00:48:01.849 --> 00:48:01.859 align:start position:0%
when you call them cultivators
 
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
cultivators correct you are talking
 
00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.450 align:start position:0%
cultivators correct you are talking
about

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
um businesses with greenhouses and
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
vertical integration absolutely well I
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
don't know about vertical would you mean
 
00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
by vertical but that yes they're highly
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
regulated highly you know and they're
 
00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
airtight they have their special
 
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
ventilation systems I think they'll be
 
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
big electric consumers so they might
 
00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:27.500 align:start position:0%
have to have some net metering there yes
 
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
solar installations yes
 
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
but on in so we really do have to solve
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
the vertical integration problem it's
 
00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
interesting that you bring that up
 
00:48:41.089 --> 00:48:41.099 align:start position:0%
because Vermont evidently didn't really
 
00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
think that one through and realized that
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
there was a delay in being able to have
 
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
enough product to sell to Consumers so
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
we're we absolutely we have the
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
advantage of seeing what other states
 
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
have done and what the problems are so
 
00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
we are no under No Illusion that that
 
00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a uh going to give us
 
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
deliver money anytime soon because it's
 
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
going to take a while uh for them to get
 
00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
going we have to you know create the
 
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
rules uh in terms of what they are you
 
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
have to have cities to approve have to
 
00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
vote to approve to allow these to occur
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
and how many they want and where do they
 
00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
want to Zone them where they want them
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
so cities and towns absolutely have you
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
know are going to be involved in that
 
00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
upfront beginning process so so yeah
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
this is today is a long way away from
 
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
when this is really going to be
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
happening that is true and another thing
 
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
that Vermont does follow-up yes thank
 
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
you another thing that Vermont does is
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
to allow and I think encourage outdoor
 
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
cultivators they've already had to close
 
00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:47.660 align:start position:0%
down one
 
00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:49.210 align:start position:0%
down one
because

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:49.220 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:57.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
the shrinkage yeah yeah animal shrinkage
 
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
or weather shrinkage right now that I I
 
00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:05.579 align:start position:0%
would say is that I would be very
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
surprised now we our
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of going through other states
 
00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
you know the you know is probably the
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
only one that that did that and I'm sure
 
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
that that was done in
 
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
uh trying to be a little more natural
 
00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
about the things about the the plants
 
00:50:25.849 --> 00:50:25.859 align:start position:0%
but in reality you know you're we're
 
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
it's this is a controlled
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
product that we we want to make sure
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
that that nobody can just stumble onto
 
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
it in the woods and say but I'm gonna
 
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
steal a butter too
 
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
I see a whole bunch of other okay go
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
ahead so why did you leave in the
 
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
um ability to cultivate outdoors I we're
 
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
we're pro-choice you know if that if
 
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
that's something they want to do but I
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that her but if you think
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's a bad idea then then I would urge
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
we'd take that up in the Senate because
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's a policy decision that if you
 
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
think we should take that out
 
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
yeah representative liebly
 
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
presentation this is a lot to process
 
00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
it's a long Bill nice to see you coming
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
to walk us through it
 
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:17.220 align:start position:0%
um as I'm trying to to understand from
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know the seed to the purpose could
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
the person consuming I'm thinking about
 
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
the process and I'm thinking a lot of
 
00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:28.910 align:start position:0%
the process and I'm thinking a lot of
people

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
probably would be interested in jumping
 
00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
in at that processor manufacturer
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
stage like that's a value-added stage
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
right yes where
 
00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:38.510 align:start position:0%
right yes where
um

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
you can see a lot of profit
 
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
being made there my concern is that
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
it picks up on the representatives
 
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
concern about Farmers wanting to do this
 
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering about that's also the
 
00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:57.059 align:start position:0%
level where we're taxing them so it
 
00:51:59.569 --> 00:51:59.579 align:start position:0%
seems like that
 
00:52:02.329 --> 00:52:02.339 align:start position:0%
I see that as being the
 
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
the difficult part to get off the ground
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
why not put the tax where there's more
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
interest in participating or more a
 
00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:18.740 align:start position:0%
lower bar to get into
 
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
the market so I'm concerned that putting
 
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
all the tax on the farmer is going to
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
make it even more difficult or less
 
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
interesting monetarily for people to get
 
00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.349 align:start position:0%
interesting monetarily for people to get
involved

00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
um I guess the way I saw was that it is
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
you we certainly allowing for small
 
00:52:38.569 --> 00:52:38.579 align:start position:0%
operations and that the fees would be
 
00:52:38.579 --> 00:52:39.589 align:start position:0%
operations and that the fees would be
less

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:52:41.809 --> 00:52:41.819 align:start position:0%
for smallers you know obviously the tax
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
is still the same but that you would
 
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
just you know it's it's a cost of doing
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
business I mean in terms of the that 15
 
00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
in terms of it is a cost but again we're
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
we're taxing at the at the most basic
 
00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:55.190 align:start position:0%
we're taxing at the at the most basic
level

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
you know the product that you're dealing
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
with so if you think about if they were
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to make you know uh uh the Gummy
 
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
Bears or whatever the other products
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
these you know that there's a lot of
 
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
room there for them to uh that to
 
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
amortize that 15 you know that tax
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
whatever it is in terms of that spread
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
and they won't have to worry about that
 
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
that's the key thing they don't have to
 
00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
worry that or you know if I if I charge
 
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
too much for this am I now hurting
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
myself because of attacks no so at that
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
point you're going to charge what do you
 
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
think is the real market value of the
 
00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:32.809 align:start position:0%
think is the real market value of the
product

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
can I have a follow-up
 
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.650 align:start position:0%
can I have a follow-up
um

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
so just to continue along that line it
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
seems like if I were interested in
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
getting involved in this business
 
00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
there as a farmer there's no way I
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't continue up the chain because
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
it seems like it would be
 
00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
you would have such an interest in in
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
being at the processor level because
 
00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
that's where you can really make a
 
00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.690 align:start position:0%
that's where you can really make a
profit

00:53:59.690 --> 00:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
profit
 
00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
um versus the retail uh no all the way
 
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
up yeah okay um you wouldn't want to do
 
00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
all three right I think that they would
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah and it just seems like not
 
00:54:14.329 --> 00:54:14.339 align:start position:0%
it just seems really like that farmer
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
that cultivator is is just such a high
 
00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:18.829 align:start position:0%
that cultivator is is just such a high
bar

00:54:18.829 --> 00:54:18.839 align:start position:0%
bar
 
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
so that was my concern about are we just
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
making it that much harder by putting
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
the tax at that level
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure if you no I I would have
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
to say that my first reaction I was a
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
little concerned that you know that this
 
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
By Doing it The Upfront that way
 
00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
um but then when I realized that in any
 
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
time you know again when we do with the
 
00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
beer tax where we do we tax it when it
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
at least it goes from the distributor to
 
00:54:47.089 --> 00:54:47.099 align:start position:0%
the to the retailer it's up up front in
 
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
that 15 days so as long as that you know
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
the bill is paid on time
 
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
then it's not a cash flow problem
 
00:54:58.250 --> 00:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
that's what that's where I came out you
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
know have you learned to have that same
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
15 day Arrangement you know then then no
 
00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
it's not going to hurt you at all
 
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
yeah you're welcome representative
 
00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:08.150 align:start position:0%
yeah you're welcome representative
Bolton

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
Bolton
 
00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:10.140 align:start position:0%
thank you down chair um I've got a
 
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
question regarding the uh um alternative
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
treatment centers and the cultivators
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
that are being engaged to supply them
 
00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:22.140 align:start position:0%
are they at all perhaps interested or uh
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
I believe they are I believe they are
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
and this will certainly allow them to be
 
00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
able to produce it because I follow
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
could I ask how many how many
 
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:31.380 align:start position:0%
cultivators are there I I believe we
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
only have what five atcs in the state
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
okay second round of questions if the
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative will entertain them
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative oh representative
 
00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.349 align:start position:0%
representative oh representative
Pillsbury

00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
Pillsbury
 
00:55:47.569 --> 00:55:47.579 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:55:47.579 --> 00:55:48.109 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman hunt
 
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:52.740 align:start position:0%
very complicated and I'm just starting
 
00:55:55.849 --> 00:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
to try to wrap my head around it so
 
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
it strikes me that when we make an
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
analogy to the Beer tax or the way that
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
we tax fuel at the pump
 
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
the taxes applied at the wholesale level
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
but it's being applied to a finished
 
00:56:12.119 --> 00:56:13.790 align:start position:0%
but it's being applied to a finished
product

00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
and it's simply
 
00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
it's not applied at the retail purchase
 
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
point but it's the same product
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
here it seems to me we're moving in a
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
different direction
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
and we're
 
00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.130 align:start position:0%
and we're
we're

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:28.140 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
taxing what is essentially a material
 
00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.470 align:start position:0%
taxing what is essentially a material
um

00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.210 align:start position:0%
um
before

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
it's converted into the final product
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's really an ingredient it strikes me
 
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
from what I've heard about usually not
 
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
familiar but it sounds like a very
 
00:56:50.809 --> 00:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
significant percentage of the sales
 
00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
will be processed product as opposed to
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
a 90 yeah I can't imagine there will be
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
that many Bud sales get the bag of Bud
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
the closest to the raw material would be
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
a reefer
 
00:57:03.359 --> 00:57:05.390 align:start position:0%
a reefer
right

00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just I'm not seeing the
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
analogy to beer I'm stretching for
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
another analogy with uh how about Timber
 
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
attacks gasoline
 
00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:19.430 align:start position:0%
attacks gasoline
mm-hmm

00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:21.059 align:start position:0%
and I just came up with that but if you
 
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
give me a couple more minutes I'll think
 
00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
of some more but you guys know all the
 
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:28.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.089 --> 00:57:31.099 align:start position:0%
raw material
 
00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
and I want to consider this but the
 
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
analogies that I was going to didn't
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
seem clear so if I can have a follow-up
 
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
question then so you know by the same
 
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
token okay Timber tax
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
there's a huge differential isn't there
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of the valuation of the array
 
00:57:58.849 --> 00:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
of final products and the the amount of
 
00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
other ingredients that may go into one
 
00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
form versus another form the amount of
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
markup the the difference in retail
 
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
prices for a variety of different
 
00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:11.390 align:start position:0%
prices for a variety of different
products

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
so we're taxing as though it's one
 
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
generic ingredient
 
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
but we're selling a whole array of
 
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
things at different price points
 
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
I I'm still trying to figure out if
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
that's where I think the tax ought to go
 
00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
right well I would urge you to think in
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
terms of that if you have a tax you want
 
00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:33.500 align:start position:0%
to have a tax that is easily
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
valued in terms of you know what the
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
what the tax should be easily calculated
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
and easy to regulate and and enforce
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
and that that's by taxing at that
 
00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
cultivator level when they're delivering
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
it that is uh we're already monitoring
 
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
exactly what their production is
 
00:58:55.849 --> 00:58:55.859 align:start position:0%
we know with their production so we'll
 
00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
know that the taxes know so it just
 
00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:01.559 align:start position:0%
makes it so much easier for the state to
 
00:59:03.609 --> 00:59:03.619 align:start position:0%
apply the tax
 
00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
when you start adding other value-added
 
00:59:08.329 --> 00:59:08.339 align:start position:0%
values and stuff like that it makes it
 
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
more complicated let alone as I said
 
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.809 align:start position:0%
more complicated let alone as I said
shrinkage

00:59:11.809 --> 00:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
shrinkage
 
00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
um so to me this just seems like a New
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way of doing it which is to at
 
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
the simple basic level easy to enforce
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
not a lot of you know you know in terms
 
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
of we're already going to be going in we
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
already go right now for instance of the
 
00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:29.339 align:start position:0%
beer we already visit and look at the
 
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
beer manufacturer and what their
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
production levels are we know what their
 
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
what their levels are so when it comes
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
to the tax there are no surprises
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
um so in that sense it's simple but I
 
00:59:41.569 --> 00:59:41.579 align:start position:0%
guess on the other side I'll take from
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
rivers and reference let's not get
 
00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:44.579 align:start position:0%
greedy here
 
00:59:46.609 --> 00:59:46.619 align:start position:0%
you know that's uh let's not try to you
 
00:59:48.289 --> 00:59:48.299 align:start position:0%
know try to tax it at every level like
 
00:59:49.849 --> 00:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
other states and that's you know terms
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
of this is a big Revenue to the state I
 
00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:53.579 align:start position:0%
mean I don't think we we do we don't
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
need to do that because it is true
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to be their businesses
 
00:59:58.250 --> 00:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
they're going to pay business profits
 
01:00:02.569 --> 01:00:02.579 align:start position:0%
tax uh you know bet tax and and uh so
 
01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
there's a ton of other opportunities uh
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
you know in creating new employment so
 
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of other things for the
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
state to benefit from
 
01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
um so we shouldn't you know we should
 
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
but but at the end of the day we want to
 
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
keep it simple we want how the best tax
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
that have the least problems in
 
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.089 align:start position:0%
that have the least problems in
enforcing

01:00:22.089 --> 01:00:22.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative what thank you madam
 
01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.030 align:start position:0%
representative what thank you madam
chair

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:00:28.609 --> 01:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
you said earlier some might go beyond
 
01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
the cultivator level and also
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
manufacture our retail if they were to
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
do that what would keep them from
 
01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
underpricing the cultivation part of it
 
01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
to avoid the tax make the profit on the
 
01:00:44.109 --> 01:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
I mean you're it I don't know which
 
01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.370 align:start position:0%
I mean you're it I don't know which
level

01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:48.380 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this selling cultivated
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
product to themselves to manufacture and
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
then to retail if they were to sell the
 
01:00:59.289 --> 01:00:59.299 align:start position:0%
marijuana cheaper to some for themselves
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
essentially to avoid the attacks what's
 
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
to keep them from doing that how will we
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
enforce against it
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
um so so at the end of the day either
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
there they have to Value it correctly in
 
01:01:13.849 --> 01:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
terms of what they would say is the open
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
market price for it so
 
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
my pleasure okay I'm sure
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy
 
01:01:31.609 --> 01:01:31.619 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair for uh
 
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for your testimony
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
today I appreciate it and I have a
 
01:01:36.839 --> 01:01:38.030 align:start position:0%
today I appreciate it and I have a
pleasure

01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
pleasure
 
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
I've learned a lot here from our
 
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
presentation so far is
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
what I and I understand I think I
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
understand the the tax structure and how
 
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
it's levied and it I conceptually agree
 
01:01:53.329 --> 01:01:53.339 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:01:53.339 --> 01:01:54.770 align:start position:0%
with that
um

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:56.569 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:01:56.569 --> 01:01:56.579 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
do I have do I understand that there are
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
different levels of the active
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
ingredient in this product and that
 
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
regardless of that active the level of
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
the active ingredient it would still be
 
01:02:13.849 --> 01:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
taxed at 15 coming from the cultivator
 
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
regardless of the strength regardless of
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
the quality regardless of however these
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
the interesting element that uh in every
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
state has done this is requirements that
 
01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
uh the product is tested
 
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
and they do it for multiple reasons
 
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
obviously the most important is safety
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
is making sure that the product is is
 
01:02:45.049 --> 01:02:45.059 align:start position:0%
safe and and appropriate
 
01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
um and we certainly don't want to you
 
01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
know have uh
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know chemicals or whatever DDT
 
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
sprayed on top of these plants so that
 
01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
that is the testing it is a requirement
 
01:02:59.390 --> 01:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
to know what it is but and more
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
importantly is that that when it comes
 
01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
time for them to be selling that product
 
01:03:05.569 --> 01:03:05.579 align:start position:0%
that cultivator selling that product
 
01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:08.339 align:start position:0%
that yes they they've got to know what
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
what they're selling and what they're
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know and pricing it that way
 
01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
and so there is a invested interest in
 
01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:16.859 align:start position:0%
making sure they know exactly what
 
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:23.700 align:start position:0%

recognize them if they come back uh

01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:23.660 align:start position:0%
people on both sides of the issue
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
and we produced a final report and this
 
01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
is half the report uh was over 200 pages
 
01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:31.390 align:start position:0%
is half the report uh was over 200 pages
long

01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
long
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
and we had 54 recommendations in there
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to say that a lot of those
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations are in the bill so I'm
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
happy about that
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
I understand I'm here just talk about
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
revenues I'm Mutual on this I've always
 
01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:49.220 align:start position:0%
been a no vote so I was wondering why
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
speaker Jasper at the time selected me
 
01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
to chair this
 
01:04:56.569 --> 01:04:56.579 align:start position:0%
um and I my goal was to be fair
 
01:04:59.030 --> 01:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
in our role in the canister commission
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
is to come up with the best model for
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
the state if we were to do this in the
 
01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
future and at the time there were only
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
eight states that had legalized and we
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
talked we spoke to all of those eight
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
states by via Skype actually because
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
that was before our current Age
 
01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.609 align:start position:0%
that was before our current Age
Technology

01:05:16.609 --> 01:05:16.619 align:start position:0%
Technology
 
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
and we learned a lot
 
01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:20.420 align:start position:0%
but anyway I I
 
01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
produced a document four pages
 
01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh I went to the bill
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
and I have uh some comments
 
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh some commentary
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
some future drafting errors that I think
 
01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
you need to address
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh some strongly suggested
 
01:05:39.359 --> 01:05:41.329 align:start position:0%
uh some strongly suggested
recommendations

01:05:41.329 --> 01:05:41.339 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
and then I gave my version of Revenue
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
estimates I hadn't seen any real Revenue
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
estimates so I I went back to the
 
01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
original report and discussed I took
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
those numbers and I I brought them
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
forward to this year and to fit the
 
01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
model that that came out of Commerce I
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
did not tell me I did not testify in
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
Commerce I wanted to let this play
 
01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
through and it did play through
 
01:06:06.289 --> 01:06:06.299 align:start position:0%
and what I think I'm going to do is
 
01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
again the way I set this up I have 14
 
01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
points I have this document
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh you can follow along with the bill
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
it's almost uh maybe too detailed but
 
01:06:20.049 --> 01:06:20.059 align:start position:0%
what I want to do is
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
start with uh what I just heard you know
 
01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
most of these businesses are vertically
 
01:06:25.619 --> 01:06:26.569 align:start position:0%
most of these businesses are vertically
integrated

01:06:26.569 --> 01:06:26.579 align:start position:0%
integrated
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
so that means the cultivation
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing and then the retail
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay the three major steps
 
01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.670 align:start position:0%
okay the three major steps
uh

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:40.849 --> 01:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
but but the but they don't have to be
 
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
they can be one of any of those okay but
 
01:06:48.049 --> 01:06:48.059 align:start position:0%
even our our therapeutic uh uh program
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana by the way there are
 
01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
four owners and seven that own seven
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
between them seven locations today and
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that they're all
 
01:07:01.609 --> 01:07:01.619 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
they grow they manufacture and they
 
01:07:04.559 --> 01:07:06.470 align:start position:0%
they grow they manufacture and they
retail

01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
retail
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
but that does not mean that this bill
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
does not say to a farmer
 
01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
they can't grow they can bow
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
next sell to the market
 
01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
okay they could sell their market look
 
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
at anybody else and then it's it's it's
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
a free enterprise thing so the strong
 
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
still survive
 
01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:24.710 align:start position:0%
still survive
um

01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
and in terms of what sold today and
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
there were more experts on this in the
 
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
current days but a current uh facts
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
about this but people still buy loose
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
flour they call it and that may be 45 to
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
50 percent it's kind of and the
 
01:07:45.289 --> 01:07:45.299 align:start position:0%
manufactured part is is is where you may
 
01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
create the gumbies and the brownies and
 
01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:47.579 align:start position:0%
all that stuff
 
01:07:47.579 --> 01:07:49.910 align:start position:0%
all that stuff
so

01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.109 align:start position:0%
so
but

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the bill is that a a
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
cultivator can sell to the manufacturer
 
01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
or can sell directly to the retailer
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
and the retailer creates the
 
01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:03.109 align:start position:0%
and the retailer creates the
um

01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
the bags if you will of
 
01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
um by ounce or whatever whatever you
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
decide to buy you want to buy half an
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
ounce you want to buy a quarter of an
 
01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:10.370 align:start position:0%
ounce you want to buy a quarter of an
ounce

01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
ounce
 
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
and announces a lot by the way it sounds
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
small but in a marijuana world that's
 
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a pretty big quantity
 
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
that's why it goes by the ounce
 
01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:21.349 align:start position:0%
that's why it goes by the ounce
so

01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
what I if you if you follow along
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
some comments
 
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
there's going to be Revenue going to
 
01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.070 align:start position:0%
there's going to be Revenue going to
education

01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
well that won't happen for a long time I
 
01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:39.299 align:start position:0%
think 130 years from now
 
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
if you look at the unfunded Prince and
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
liability of
 
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
5.69 billion dollars
 
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
and I estimate around 43
 
01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:52.739 align:start position:0%
million best case
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
that's divide the two numbers
 
01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
that's 130 years from now so I think
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's a little
 
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to advertise to
 
01:09:02.269 --> 01:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
the left side because some that may sway
 
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
some legislators to vote Yes on this if
 
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
they think money's going to education
 
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
and education money only kicks in
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
when we solve the pension liability
 
01:09:12.359 --> 01:09:13.490 align:start position:0%
when we solve the pension liability
problem

01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
when I was first a legislator 12 years
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
ago that problem was five billion
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
dollars and was supposed to I heard
 
01:09:21.289 --> 01:09:21.299 align:start position:0%
always going to get better well now it's
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
5.6 and 12 years is 5.69 billion so this
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
will help having the money go there uh
 
01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
it'll it'll help reduce that number but
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's it's going to go away
 
01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
in our our lifetime so education will
 
01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
never see the money the way the bill is
 
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
written education gets the money once we
 
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
solve the pension liability problem
 
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
on page one line 15 this is in the uh
 
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
purpose statement
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
you get the impression that by doing
 
01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
this we're going to get rid of the
 
01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.169 align:start position:0%
this we're going to get rid of the
illicit

01:09:54.169 --> 01:09:54.179 align:start position:0%
illicit
 
01:09:54.179 --> 01:09:55.430 align:start position:0%
illicit
Market

01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
Market
 
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to go from illicit Market to
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
legal to some degree yes
 
01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
but in every state we talked to and in
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
my my research even today
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
that we reduced the illegal Market we
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
don't get rid of the illegal market so
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
you may want to edit that out as well uh
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
this is that has nothing to do with ways
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
it means but that's just the point
 
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
we get to the revenue near the end of
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
the bill we're going to get there
 
01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:33.709 align:start position:0%
the bill we're going to get there
um

01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
oh the
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
yeah the tracking system
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh that's very important
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh the bill does call for it's a May
 
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
it's a man not a man it's a shell they
 
01:10:56.209 --> 01:10:56.219 align:start position:0%
shall have these
 
01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
businesses shall use the tracking system
 
01:11:03.169 --> 01:11:03.179 align:start position:0%
and Most states what they do and I think
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
will happen here is that that the
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
liquor and cannabis commission will
 
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
buy the the software
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
and then the the various various
 
01:11:20.570 --> 01:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
businesses will contract with them to to
 
01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
use the system to track the point is is
 
01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
that that's a very important feature
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
because later on I'm going to recommend
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
other than with with representative hunt
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
said I think we should be I agree with
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
100 with the taxing at the cultivation
 
01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.810 align:start position:0%
100 with the taxing at the cultivation
level

01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
I think we should we should be charging
 
01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
not on the price but on the but on the
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
weight on the ounce
 
01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
but what happens with these tracking
 
01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
systems you will keep track of the outs
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
when we transfer
 
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
an ounce of the product from the
 
01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
cultivator to the manufacturer or to the
 
01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
retailer it keeps track of that we know
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
where it goes so there's an auditing
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
mechanism with the tracking system for
 
01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
following the revenue as well and that's
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
why I mentioned it here so that that
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism will will be in place
 
01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
I did miss one on pay line four and Page
 
01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
four and line nine
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
it talks about
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
concentrated issue of concentrated came
 
01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.910 align:start position:0%
concentrated issue of concentrated came
up

01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.910 align:start position:0%
up
um

01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.729 --> 01:12:24.739 align:start position:0%
yeah it said
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
concentrated cannabis products what
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
people don't understand is
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
some of these products are very potent
 
01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.250 align:start position:0%
some of these products are very potent
stuff

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:33.260 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
the the concentrates and they create
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
these waxes
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
uh that they dab they take the wax to
 
01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
heat it up it goes from solid to Vapor
 
01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
and it's 94 THC okay so that's just a
 
01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
little commentary
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh I know that was off that was
 
01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
anyone yeah let's try to if we can try
 
01:12:58.130 --> 01:12:58.140 align:start position:0%
to really focus it in other Revenue
 
01:12:59.930 --> 01:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
stuff that we can actually wait you're
 
01:13:02.169 --> 01:13:02.179 align:start position:0%
never gonna do that thank you
 
01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh line 30 uh line 34.
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
here's one we we started talking about
 
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
and we've heard already about the uh uh
 
01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
the alternative treatment centers
 
01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
and the bill is kind of Silent on and it
 
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:27.780 align:start position:0%
also has to do with the Dual
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
this in the build is a provision for
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
dual use certificates
 
01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
so that the atcs can also sell retail
 
01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
so from a ways and means perspective we
 
01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
have to be able to keep track of because
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
the atcs are not taxed you're not going
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
to tax the atcs or are we I don't know
 
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
for the product so I think there's
 
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:51.780 align:start position:0%
somebody from from the alternative
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
treatment centers here hopefully that
 
01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
they will
 
01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
um address that
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh so that's something that's a that's
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
silent in the bill I think it needs to
 
01:14:03.050 --> 01:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
be addressed how do we handle the tax we
 
01:14:04.729 --> 01:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that when when product
 
01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
transfers from because we're going to
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
also allow atcs to sell to the retail
 
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.310 align:start position:0%
also allow atcs to sell to the retail
Market

01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
Market
 
01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
that's fine that should be taxed but if
 
01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
but these atcs grow so when they sell to
 
01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
the to the manufacturer to the retail
 
01:14:20.209 --> 01:14:20.219 align:start position:0%
market for recreational
 
01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
is that part chat tax so we need to have
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
a mechanism in the bill to make sure
 
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
that uh uh we're only taxing
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh the recreational marijuana that's
 
01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:33.900 align:start position:0%
being used for a creational
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
on page 13
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
this is just a real typo thing
 
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
online 26
 
01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:45.900 align:start position:0%
it goes uh it is it goes a in
 
01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
parentheses B in parenthesis and it goes
 
01:14:49.729 --> 01:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
to D in parentheses
 
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming it means C in parentheses
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
or it could be it goes one in
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
parentheses two and percentage three
 
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
percent parentheses I think it should be
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
it's either D in parentheses or four in
 
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
parentheses it's not clear
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
line 13.
 
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
again representative that is not really
 
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
related to the text no but I'm pointing
 
01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
out to the committee I'm trying to do
 
01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
your favor to fix the bill
 
01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
if if you wouldn't mind though focusing
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
on your your verbal testimony on the
 
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:34.729 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:15:34.729 --> 01:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
municipality May enact the ordinance
 
01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:38.270 align:start position:0%
municipality May enact the ordinance
prohibiting

01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
prohibiting
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh that to me this is a an opt-out
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
Clause I strongly recommend that we put
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
an opt-in clause
 
01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh and I'll I'll let that one go through
 
01:15:51.649 --> 01:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
a lottery users opt-in you know we did
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
opt-in uh to me this is an opt out
 
01:15:58.130 --> 01:15:58.140 align:start position:0%
clause uh and I'll I'll say it there
 
01:15:59.930 --> 01:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that
 
01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:01.070 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that
page

01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
line uh
 
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
line 17 and line 27
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
there's a reference to RSA 77h
 
01:16:22.729 --> 01:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
that doesn't it doesn't appear in in
 
01:16:22.739 --> 01:16:23.870 align:start position:0%
that doesn't it doesn't appear in in
statute

01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
and it and it it does isn't created in
 
01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
the Bell either so I see representative
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
Ames is shaking his head yes
 
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh and I think that reference was there
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
because of the way it was going to be
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
taxed before this but that needs to be
 
01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
fixed and I talked to Keane and Keane is
 
01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
going to also talk about this so we
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
don't have to linger on it but uh
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
also online tournament but uh
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
line 15.
 
01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:54.770 align:start position:0%
line 15.
15.

01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh it says money's credited to the fund
 
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
shall include deposits into the fund by
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
the commission pursuing this chapter and
 
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
the commission is the when it says
 
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
commission and the definitions
 
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
commission is the Cannabis alcohol
 
01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.570 align:start position:0%
commission is the Cannabis alcohol
Commission

01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
and deposits into the fund by the
 
01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Department of Revenue
 
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
pursuant two we're always say blah blah
 
01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:19.490 align:start position:0%
pursuant two we're always say blah blah
77h

01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
77h
 
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
well my understanding is that the
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue has nothing to do
 
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:23.940 align:start position:0%
with this anymore
 
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
so that's something that needs to be
 
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
corrected and uh Keen will will after I
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
read this I wrote this up I talked to
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
Keenan and he I think he agrees with
 
01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:35.060 align:start position:0%
that needs to be fixed
 
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
it references cannabis Commission
 
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
by itself there's no such thing as
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
Canada's condition
 
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
when it says it's either commission or
 
01:17:51.649 --> 01:17:51.659 align:start position:0%
it's the Cannabis and
 
01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:53.300 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
liquor and uh cannabis Commission
 
01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.739 --> 01:18:03.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
line one through eight
 
01:18:08.169 --> 01:18:08.179 align:start position:0%
and this is where I was saying earlier
 
01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
that we have the unfunded liability this
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
is this is the section that converts the
 
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
money going to
 
01:18:18.649 --> 01:18:18.659 align:start position:0%
from going to the um
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh pension relief
 
01:18:25.149 --> 01:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
so this this Clause here from page 22 to
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
line one through nine or eight
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
it basically says once we solve the
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
pension problem
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
the money will go to education
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't hold your breath
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
so I
 
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
I strongly recommend that this um
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
and the way I did it I estimated that
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
revenue is higher than I don't know what
 
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
you just got
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
but I thought net net uh that that uh 80
 
01:18:56.689 --> 01:18:56.699 align:start position:0%
percent that goes to pension relief that
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
would then go to education amongst about
 
01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
43 million you divide the 43 million
 
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
into the 5.6 billion
 
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
that's 130. it's going to take a long
 
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
time to fix that that problem with this
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
it helps it helps so it's something to
 
01:19:13.729 --> 01:19:13.739 align:start position:0%
think about as to whether you you want
 
01:19:13.739 --> 01:19:15.290 align:start position:0%
think about as to whether you you want
that

01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.970 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
then we have page 22 line 11 and 14. by
 
01:19:24.649 --> 01:19:24.659 align:start position:0%
the way this section is where the money
 
01:19:24.659 --> 01:19:25.669 align:start position:0%
the way this section is where the money
goes

01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
goes
 
01:19:27.649 --> 01:19:27.659 align:start position:0%
okay how the money is spent
 
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
so line uh 11 to 14
 
01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:35.209 align:start position:0%
so line uh 11 to 14
uh

01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:35.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
it talks about five percent going to the
 
01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:40.550 align:start position:0%
it talks about five percent going to the
municipalities

01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
but only to have a retail store
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
retail store
 
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
I don't like that that's not New
 
01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.229 align:start position:0%
I don't like that that's not New
Hampshire

01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
we don't we just don't we don't say well
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to reward you
 
01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
for having a a marijuana store
 
01:19:59.390 --> 01:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh and to me it's a it's a um
 
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
we don't do that with any of our other
 
01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
taxes we don't do it for roomy meals tax
 
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
we don't do it with the highway funds
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
you know you may not have a gas station
 
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
near town and and we we still they still
 
01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
get Highway funds so I think we should
 
01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh make that go to all municipalities I
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
have a I think that's a great idea I
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
have a go to municipalities but uh not
 
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
in this way plus I also view this as an
 
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
enticement to towns
 
01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
who may not otherwise want to do this
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
and they're going to say well geez we're
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to get a lot more memorable if we
 
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
do this so I don't I don't I don't like
 
01:20:36.490 --> 01:20:36.500 align:start position:0%
this uh provision that that I just
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
rewards towns for having a cannabis
 
01:20:39.239 --> 01:20:41.689 align:start position:0%
rewards towns for having a cannabis
business

01:20:41.689 --> 01:20:41.699 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:20:44.689 --> 01:20:44.699 align:start position:0%
and then also on the same theme so I I
 
01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
strongly recommend that we just change
 
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
it to all municipalities line 22
 
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
uh page 3022 lines 13 to 14 which is a
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
subset of that
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh then even if you don't change that it
 
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
says percentage of tax revenue collected
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
from retail stores
 
01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
so again that's an error now because the
 
01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
retail stores aren't taxing it
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
get it you understand we tell us our
 
01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
stories that needs to be modified even
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
if you don't accept my recommendation to
 
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
to make it go to all municipalities then
 
01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
I don't know how you
 
01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
how you keep track of this provision
 
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
as to someone's gonna have to keep track
 
01:21:25.729 --> 01:21:25.739 align:start position:0%
of how much I I don't know so that one's
 
01:21:25.739 --> 01:21:27.050 align:start position:0%
of how much I I don't know so that one's
messy

01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
messy
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then line 22
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me page 22 line 15.
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
it was the last take if you will
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh five percent not to exceed a million
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
dollars goes to Public Safety
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh the problem hap what happens is
 
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
what happens if what happens if there's
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
extra money the bill is silent on where
 
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
the money where does that money go
 
01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
does it stay in the fund whatever and
 
01:21:59.689 --> 01:21:59.699 align:start position:0%
I'll show you in the example that I have
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
so I I again in terms of the the bigger
 
01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
issue of to the the commission the
 
01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
marijuana commission years ago
 
01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:11.219 align:start position:0%
recommended that it be taxed at the
 
01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
wholesale level at the grower level okay
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to see that
 
01:22:20.209 --> 01:22:20.219 align:start position:0%
but I I uh I would strongly recommend
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
that we do it on the outs other than
 
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
what representative hunt was saying
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh primarily because it's more stable
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
let's let's use the two examples that
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
were mentioned the uh beer tax
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
and the and the uh rotol which is the
 
01:22:40.729 --> 01:22:40.739 align:start position:0%
gasoline tax
 
01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
we tax it up we tax it at the gallon
 
01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:44.330 align:start position:0%
we tax it up we tax it at the gallon
basis

01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
and that's stable with gas fluctuations
 
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
the way they are
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
it'd be some some periods would have
 
01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
great revenues other periods would have
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
bad I think it's more stable better to
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
tax it at the ounce level at the grower
 
01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.149 align:start position:0%
tax it at the ounce level at the grower
level

01:22:59.149 --> 01:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
so so I just want to maybe do on the
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
text at the ounce level
 
01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
so Mike I took a crack just to give you
 
01:23:13.010 --> 01:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
a sense of things what we had come up
 
01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
with in the marijuana Commission
 
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
we had we had talked about taxing and it
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
announced between 23 and
 
01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
at the time in the report it was 56 but
 
01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
I used 57 to run so to be no rounding
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh per ounce
 
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
uh time Alaska was was charging fifty
 
01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
dollars an ounce
 
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
at the at the rural level
 
01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.229 align:start position:0%
at the at the rural level
uh

01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
and and then
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
we use the New York State methodology
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
where we estimated there would be 130
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
cannabis users and about 1563 tourists
 
01:23:48.530 --> 01:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
we had a tourist Factor
 
01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
so we we assumed about 131
 
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
000 and change users
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
and the math that they had researched
 
01:23:58.610 --> 01:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
was that users range from they used five
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
to seven point nine ounces a year
 
01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
so I came up with this chart here and
 
01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
paid my third page of this of the low to
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
the high of 657 000 ounces to be sold to
 
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
a little over a million ounces
 
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
and then I use the tax range
 
01:24:19.490 --> 01:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
of 23 to 57. so at the low end
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
you're looking at Revenue at 15 million
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
at the high end you're looking at
 
01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
Revenue at 59 million
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh and as was said you don't want to tax
 
01:24:31.970 --> 01:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
it too high
 
01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
of course you you don't you don't scare
 
01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
away the the black market very quickly
 
01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
because but
 
01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:40.610 align:start position:0%
because but
um

01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:45.290 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:24:45.290 --> 01:24:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
so I if I had a pick I would pick
 
01:24:50.630 --> 01:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the 50 range 50 50 uh you
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
know that range then the other thing is
 
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
the way the math works and this chart
 
01:24:59.209 --> 01:24:59.219 align:start position:0%
will help answer some questions I think
 
01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:01.490 align:start position:0%
will help answer some questions I think
uh

01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
the the the percentages get applied
 
01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
after the the cost of running the
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
program comes off the top
 
01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
okay we have Revenue the cost goes that
 
01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
money goes to pay the expense of
 
01:25:16.490 --> 01:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
regulating it
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
and then and then it has a bunch of
 
01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
steps after that so I estimated from the
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
original bill and I did some adjusting
 
01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
based on the model in this the midpoint
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
around 4.4 million to run this whole
 
01:25:27.239 --> 01:25:28.729 align:start position:0%
around 4.4 million to run this whole
thing

01:25:28.729 --> 01:25:28.739 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:25:31.729 --> 01:25:31.739 align:start position:0%
so so I took my low and my high worst
 
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
case the best case
 
01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
I subtracted out the midpoint from all
 
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
of those to get Revenue after expense 10
 
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
000 10 million to 54 million change
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
then the Bill calls for a hundred
 
01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
then the Bill calls for a hundred
thousand

01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
to go off come off the top of that to go
 
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
to Department of Safety
 
01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:51.350 align:start position:0%
to Department of Safety
right

01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
so now you're left with what you see
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
there 10.5 million to 54.6 million
 
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
four percent allocation
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
so 80 goes to the New Hampshire
 
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
retirement fund
 
01:26:07.810 --> 01:26:07.820 align:start position:0%
and that would be best case worst case
 
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
84.8.4 million to 43 million
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh then then 10 goes to substance abuse
 
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
and you can see the numbers there and
 
01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
then five percent goes to the
 
01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.770 align:start position:0%
then five percent goes to the
municipalities

01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
and then uh the the rest goes to public
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
the five percent goes to Public Safety
 
01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
but with a cap of a million dollars
 
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
so you can see in this example
 
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
if the revenues were 15 million we'd be
 
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
left with no additional money
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay but in the middle and the best case
 
01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
we're looking at 630 000 and 1.7 million
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a home where is it
 
01:26:48.649 --> 01:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
going to go
 
01:26:50.209 --> 01:26:50.219 align:start position:0%
so you folks have got to figure out
 
01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
whether you just want to live alone if
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
you want to you want to uh make some
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations on that
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
so those are my thoughts
 
01:27:01.129 --> 01:27:01.139 align:start position:0%
um I have strong recommendations
 
01:27:03.169 --> 01:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
obviously and there's some some fixing
 
01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
of the build it needs to happen in terms
 
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
of some of the
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
some of the things that uh that happened
 
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
between when the they redrafted the bill
 
01:27:13.129 --> 01:27:13.139 align:start position:0%
that they things got left in or are
 
01:27:17.229 --> 01:27:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative Platt yes your idea of
 
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
taxing by the ounce uh honorable abrami
 
01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
how would you take into account the
 
01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
difference in quality and strength
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
between from productivity let's let's
 
01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
use the example like of gasoline
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
we have regular
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
and we have mid-level
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
we have premium and then we have super
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
premium and that range could be a dollar
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
or more between so when we we text
 
01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
gasoline we don't tax it based on
 
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
whether it's premium gasoline or whether
 
01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
it's regular gasoline same argument is
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
made here
 
01:27:54.649 --> 01:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
the same thing with the beer tax as as
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative hunt was saying uh that
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
right now we're taxing beer at a gallon
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
basis whether it's
 
01:28:04.729 --> 01:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
cheap beer or whether it's a premium
 
01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
beer so I mean and by the way this was
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
the the conclusion of the commission by
 
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
the way not just me then I mean you you
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
folks can do what you're going to do but
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying that the commission at
 
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
the time said this is what we we should
 
01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:18.229 align:start position:0%
the time said this is what we we should
do

01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
but now that was the logic though behind
 
01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
it representative Ellery
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
the work you did on the uh MRC that I
 
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
still have that paperwork yeah
 
01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
let's go back to page 12 934 we're
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
talking about the atcs
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that the atcs be
 
01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
treated the same way that a charity that
 
01:28:47.629 --> 01:28:47.639 align:start position:0%
has a subdivision that is profit making
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
um that is if they want to grow and they
 
01:28:52.450 --> 01:28:52.460 align:start position:0%
have an excess from for their own use
 
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
within the alternate treatment
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
that's that excess if it's sold to the
 
01:29:01.490 --> 01:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
state or to another manufacturer the
 
01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
excess would be taxed in the same
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
faction that a a charity that has a
 
01:29:08.689 --> 01:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
profit operation
 
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
would be taxed on its profit operation
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
only right
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
see exactly am I getting that correct
 
01:29:18.050 --> 01:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
the atcs there's no taxing at that at
 
01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
any level it's in hopefully they'll
 
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
they'll testify
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh there's like a fee that they pay for
 
01:29:27.169 --> 01:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
they they it's under the Department of
 
01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services by the way and
 
01:29:31.550 --> 01:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
they they pay for themselves there's
 
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
some kind of a dollar transfer from the
 
01:29:37.129 --> 01:29:37.139 align:start position:0%
from the atcs to pay for the regulation
 
01:29:40.729 --> 01:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
of the atcs it's not really a tax but
 
01:29:42.890 --> 01:29:42.900 align:start position:0%
now if we're going to allow the atcs to
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
sell their product to retail
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
some of that product has to be so the
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
bill is silent how that's going to
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
happen I mean it can be taken care in
 
01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.370 align:start position:0%
happen I mean it can be taken care in
rules

01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
but you know it's up to you folks if you
 
01:29:57.050 --> 01:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
want to try to fix that is to that part
 
01:29:59.450 --> 01:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
of the bill that says that the and it
 
01:30:00.290 --> 01:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
does say
 
01:30:05.209 --> 01:30:05.219 align:start position:0%
that the atcs now can sell to retail
 
01:30:07.490 --> 01:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
now there's also another provision in
 
01:30:08.330 --> 01:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
that said there's also a pathway
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
for for them to change their model
 
01:30:15.649 --> 01:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
that's down the road so I'm not even
 
01:30:17.689 --> 01:30:17.699 align:start position:0%
going to blur it but that they can
 
01:30:22.669 --> 01:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.689 --> 01:30:23.699 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:30:26.209 --> 01:30:26.219 align:start position:0%
would your suggestion to the atcs to be
 
01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
to have them set up a separate LLC
 
01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
within the ATC that would be profit
 
01:30:32.930 --> 01:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
making so no it doesn't be that
 
01:30:34.370 --> 01:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
complicated I just think you need to
 
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
have you got to make sure that
 
01:30:38.689 --> 01:30:38.699 align:start position:0%
that the product that they sell to the
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
retail is and I think through the to the
 
01:30:44.209 --> 01:30:44.219 align:start position:0%
tracking system the the by the way we
 
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
reflection called seed to to sale
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
the seed to sale system
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
we'll keep track of how much they're
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
selling to ATC versus how much is
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
selling to retail
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of I think the bill
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
is silent on that whole issue of
 
01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
we have these
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
Growers that are that are atcs
 
01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
that are now going to be allowed to sell
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
to retail
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
and from a tax position tax
 
01:31:14.159 --> 01:31:16.129 align:start position:0%
and from a tax position tax
basis

01:31:16.129 --> 01:31:16.139 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
again they have to be able to separate
 
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
their crop out if you will as to what's
 
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
being taxed and what's not being taxed
 
01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay on if we can shift thank you for
 
01:31:32.810 --> 01:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
discussing that more thoroughly uh if we
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
could shift gears over to the Department
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
of Safety there's the allocation of a
 
01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand and then there's the
 
01:31:41.689 --> 01:31:41.699 align:start position:0%
five percent and then there's the cap
 
01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
when you review the bill
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
do those two add together to reach a
 
01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars or is it only the five
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
percent uh that goes to Public Safety
 
01:31:54.169 --> 01:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
that has captured a million dollars or
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
what is your interpretation of well
 
01:31:57.770 --> 01:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
there's two different public safeties so
 
01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
Department it's Department the first 100
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
000 goes to the Department of Safety
 
01:32:02.810 --> 01:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
State Police
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay the hundred thousand would have
 
01:32:07.790 --> 01:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
stopped right and that's for keeping
 
01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
track of statistics on marijuana and
 
01:32:12.290 --> 01:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
stuff like that it's not prevention it's
 
01:32:15.649 --> 01:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
not whatever it's more for for
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
keeping track of of crime rates and
 
01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
other things
 
01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh related to the Cannabis issue
 
01:32:25.729 --> 01:32:25.739 align:start position:0%
the the the other when it the the the
 
01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
the the five percent that goes to the
 
01:32:30.890 --> 01:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
municipalities down at the bottom there
 
01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
is that there's two hundred thousands in
 
01:32:34.490 --> 01:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
this there's a hundred thousand that
 
01:32:35.810 --> 01:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
comes right off the top
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
then we're down to municipalities
 
01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
getting five percent
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:32:43.250 --> 01:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
all municipalities getting a piece of
 
01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:44.030 align:start position:0%
all municipalities getting a piece of
that

01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:51.169 --> 01:32:51.179 align:start position:0%
to to help with uh well back up
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
the actual oversight of of marijuana is
 
01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
going to be under the jurisdiction of
 
01:32:59.450 --> 01:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
uh of liquor enforcement
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
we already have liquor enforcement and
 
01:33:03.649 --> 01:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
they work very closely with the with the
 
01:33:06.649 --> 01:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
town the towns to to regulate alcohol
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
and tobacco
 
01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
so their their role is going to be
 
01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
expanded to include cannabis now
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
so so this is just some money to help
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
the towns out
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
as they help monitor any illegal use of
 
01:33:20.639 --> 01:33:22.070 align:start position:0%
as they help monitor any illegal use of
marijuana

01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
that that second five percent but then
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
but it caps it at the hundred thousand
 
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
not to be confused with the first
 
01:33:28.729 --> 01:33:28.739 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand that goes to the state
 
01:33:28.739 --> 01:33:29.510 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand that goes to the state
police

01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
this is this is the this is the hunt
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
this is the up to a hundred thousand
 
01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:35.219 align:start position:0%
that's going to the municipalities I
 
01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
didn't write the bill this is why my
 
01:33:38.930 --> 01:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the bill
 
01:33:41.689 --> 01:33:41.699 align:start position:0%
okay did that you just
 
01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
no but thank you representative Doucet
 
01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you my good
 
01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
friend from stratum for his hard work
 
01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
and testimony this morning I guess my
 
01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
question just focusing in on the per
 
01:33:59.209 --> 01:33:59.219 align:start position:0%
ounce proposal that you're making this
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
this particular commodity isn't
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily measured like a gallon of
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
gasoline a gallon of gasoline is always
 
01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
a gallon of gasoline we heard testimony
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
that humidity levels and and dryness of
 
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
the product could be different for
 
01:34:16.129 --> 01:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
instance if I were to take a bushel of
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
corn and take another bushel of corn a
 
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
different strain of corn they may or may
 
01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
not depending on the the moisture level
 
01:34:26.810 --> 01:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
way differently so would you wouldn't
 
01:34:29.209 --> 01:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
you think that would be hard to to
 
01:34:29.219 --> 01:34:30.770 align:start position:0%
you think that would be hard to to
navigate

01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
navigate
 
01:34:33.729 --> 01:34:33.739 align:start position:0%
a per ounce
 
01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
but I'm the grower when I'm when I'm
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
selling it to the manufacturer to the
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
retailer it's something that basis
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
number of ounces they don't say whether
 
01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:43.610 align:start position:0%
number of ounces they don't say whether
it's

01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:45.649 align:start position:0%
it's
uh

01:34:45.649 --> 01:34:45.659 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
now there may be different prices based
 
01:34:49.729 --> 01:34:49.739 align:start position:0%
on the THC level
 
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
but to me
 
01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
that's that's
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
you know like there are for a regular
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
gasoline as well as super premium
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
there's a big wide range just like the
 
01:35:04.129 --> 01:35:04.139 align:start position:0%
Cannabis there'll be a range of higher
 
01:35:07.129 --> 01:35:07.139 align:start position:0%
THC products are going to definitely
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
it cost more
 
01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.290 align:start position:0%
it cost more
so

01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:11.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up what
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
and and I totally agree and that price
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
point will be set but but being a
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
devil's advocate we're gonna have uh
 
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
Regulators that are going to manage this
 
01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
particular product and if I was
 
01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
to assume that you know a a regulation
 
01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
would say that this stuff needed to be
 
01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
washed prior to and how long in between
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
the period that this particular product
 
01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
got a misting and then the time to dry
 
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
up I mean it just gets into the minutia
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
as to how how we weigh this particular
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying this particular product
 
01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:54.659 align:start position:0%
to go by weight I don't think they're
 
01:35:55.810 --> 01:35:55.820 align:start position:0%
going to sell it
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
moist because I'm just saying it a
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
gallon is a gallon and it's a standard
 
01:36:03.169 --> 01:36:03.179 align:start position:0%
this is not a standard measure an ounce
 
01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
is a standard measure and I totally get
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
your perspective but I'm curious as to
 
01:36:12.129 --> 01:36:12.139 align:start position:0%
how the properties of the product itself
 
01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
there's a real gray area there if you
 
01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
could appreciate what I'm trying to do
 
01:36:20.209 --> 01:36:20.219 align:start position:0%
actual marijuana itself behind me but
 
01:36:24.169 --> 01:36:24.179 align:start position:0%
to me if I was buying it if it was
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
anything that was was really moist
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh that would really make the price go
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
up you you put putting your thumb on the
 
01:36:33.169 --> 01:36:33.179 align:start position:0%
scale here right
 
01:36:36.649 --> 01:36:36.659 align:start position:0%
so but that's not what they're gonna buy
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
it should be dried
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
of flour and that's all part of
 
01:36:41.159 --> 01:36:42.770 align:start position:0%
of flour and that's all part of
Regulation

01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
Regulation
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
to me representative Bolton and then we
 
01:36:47.689 --> 01:36:47.699 align:start position:0%
can go back around okay let's hit
 
01:36:49.610 --> 01:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
everyone once thank you thank you madam
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
chair and also pronouncing my name so
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
eloquently too
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
um so my question or at least my
 
01:36:57.410 --> 01:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
observation is very similar to what
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative said
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
um but I remember well I don't remember
 
01:37:03.169 --> 01:37:03.179 align:start position:0%
reportedly back in the 60s when you
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
bought an ounce it was basically
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
some Leaf some stems some seeds maybe
 
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
some flour but now apparently that's
 
01:37:15.169 --> 01:37:15.179 align:start position:0%
basically what's being harvested at the
 
01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
um the Growers is just the flower I
 
01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
believe so I don't think you buy an
 
01:37:22.729 --> 01:37:22.739 align:start position:0%
ounce of flour
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
so I I'm kind of confused that if you
 
01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
start charging per ounce it just may be
 
01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
just the rough material
 
01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
and then if you choose to like I don't
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
see I don't think uh grower sells like
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
an ounce of flour do you know if that's
 
01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
the case or I don't know if that's the
 
01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
case there's all this I'm sure here that
 
01:37:47.810 --> 01:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
could answer that question so I'm
 
01:37:49.729 --> 01:37:49.739 align:start position:0%
thinking like a wholesale
 
01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
um price might be more targeted to like
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what you sell it's 15
 
01:37:57.229 --> 01:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
of the wholesale price might be more
 
01:37:59.629 --> 01:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
direct or accommodating to what you're
 
01:37:59.639 --> 01:38:01.129 align:start position:0%
direct or accommodating to what you're
selling

01:38:01.129 --> 01:38:01.139 align:start position:0%
selling
 
01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
again that's up to the committee to
 
01:38:04.450 --> 01:38:04.460 align:start position:0%
decide what they want to do okay
 
01:38:08.209 --> 01:38:08.219 align:start position:0%
although again there are there are price
 
01:38:11.209 --> 01:38:11.219 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in marijuana just as they
 
01:38:13.610 --> 01:38:13.620 align:start position:0%
are in gasoline
 
01:38:15.649 --> 01:38:15.659 align:start position:0%
depending on what's in the market okay
 
01:38:15.659 --> 01:38:17.689 align:start position:0%
depending on what's in the market okay
and

01:38:17.689 --> 01:38:17.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
okay so you could start at this level
 
01:38:21.649 --> 01:38:21.659 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden you we think we're
 
01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
getting this amount of Revenue and then
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
well all the competition that number's
 
01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
come way down
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
by doing it on ounce you project
 
01:38:30.590 --> 01:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
yourself from Place fluctuations and
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's why the commission decided to go
 
01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
with that that was the Prime reason why
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
to prevent
 
01:38:39.649 --> 01:38:39.659 align:start position:0%
any up or down swings in pricing that
 
01:38:41.810 --> 01:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
would impact the revenue that was our
 
01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:43.010 align:start position:0%
would impact the revenue that was our
thinking

01:38:43.010 --> 01:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative all me
 
01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
thank you huh
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
I like the ounce idea a lot better
 
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
that's just a comment on and
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
the major part of the price that they
 
01:39:02.810 --> 01:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
get it depends on that they have
 
01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
prepared it well enough that it will get
 
01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
a better price and so I don't see that
 
01:39:12.590 --> 01:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
we've got a problem with that but on the
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to ask about is I've got
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
some stuff from ncsl about marijuana tax
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
collections in millions from the states
 
01:39:25.850 --> 01:39:25.860 align:start position:0%
that have been doing this for a longer
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
time which Maine has not
 
01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:29.209 align:start position:0%
time which Maine has not
uh

01:39:29.209 --> 01:39:29.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
and I was thinking gee there's a wide
 
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
difference here but then I learned that
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
they all apply other taxes on top of it
 
01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
is there anything that lists the way we
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
used to do when we were dealing with the
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax all the time that lists the
 
01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
other taxes that the state each state is
 
01:39:54.169 --> 01:39:54.179 align:start position:0%
putting on these before you get to
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
business profits and that kind of stuff
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
right well yeah many states and I was
 
01:39:59.870 --> 01:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
going to mention this earlier many
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
states will add a sales tax on top of
 
01:40:05.689 --> 01:40:05.699 align:start position:0%
the the tax okay but is there so that's
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
why it's sometimes it's hard to compare
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
what the tax really is because they're
 
01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
taxing the tax and they're they're
 
01:40:11.930 --> 01:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
double taxing it
 
01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:13.310 align:start position:0%
double taxing it
uh

01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
and there were a few uh you know I've
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
been outside of this for a while now uh
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
but it probably is a table
 
01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
I think the commissioner may maybe have
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
an answer or some his people may have an
 
01:40:29.689 --> 01:40:29.699 align:start position:0%
answer now to what they're seeing out
 
01:40:29.699 --> 01:40:30.610 align:start position:0%
answer now to what they're seeing out
there

01:40:30.610 --> 01:40:30.620 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:32.390 align:start position:0%
there
but

01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:33.830 align:start position:0%
but
it's

01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
again we're having a tax
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
that's it there's no add-on taxes and I
 
01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
I guess my answer is no I don't I don't
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
have that chart written for me I don't
 
01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
have that yeah but I know when we did it
 
01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
there was a lot a lot of the states and
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
if you go to the marijuana report you'll
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
see the eight original states what their
 
01:40:53.810 --> 01:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
plan was and or they were doing
 
01:40:56.090 --> 01:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
in terms of of taxing and I think we did
 
01:40:58.970 --> 01:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
say in addition there was
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
a sales tax that went on top of it
 
01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
and that's why you see deflect different
 
01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
ranges but without so we have to go
 
01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
somewhere else to get the sales taxes
 
01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
yeah we have no idea I wish I had a
 
01:41:15.770 --> 01:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.169 --> 01:41:18.179 align:start position:0%
I just passed out a revised Revenue
 
01:41:19.970 --> 01:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
estimate hopefully you guys will get a
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
chance to look at that it doesn't have
 
01:41:23.570 --> 01:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
revenues oh it doesn't have revenues oh
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
I haven't looked at it okay great okay
 
01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
any final questions for the
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative former representative so
 
01:41:31.010 --> 01:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
I'm glad I gave you at least my version
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
of what they're here sir thank you very
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
much for doing the very next day I
 
01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
thought it was helpful to show how the
 
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
money flows by that last chart to say it
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
this much goes to this this and this in
 
01:41:43.609 --> 01:41:43.619 align:start position:0%
that order
 
01:41:46.250 --> 01:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
no thank you so much all right thank you
 
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
so right now I don't see any other uh
 
01:41:50.689 --> 01:41:50.699 align:start position:0%
Representatives or senators in the room
 
01:41:52.189 --> 01:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
so I just I'm going to go in the order
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
that I received the pink cards next up
 
01:42:06.010 --> 01:42:06.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:07.790 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
Ross Connolly I'm the deputy state
 
01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
director for Americans for Prosperity in
 
01:42:17.330 --> 01:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire here to voice our support
 
01:42:21.709 --> 01:42:21.719 align:start position:0%
for HB 639 and uh provide a little uh
 
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
context on on some of the the tax of of
 
01:42:27.530 --> 01:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
evolving on this bill and uh maybe a
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
couple suggestions
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
um so as the committee is very well
 
01:42:34.129 --> 01:42:34.139 align:start position:0%
aware uh New Hampshire's an island of
 
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
prohibition surrounded by states that
 
01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
have legalized in in one way or another
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh and a lot of the Coalition that that
 
01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
came together to support this bill of
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
which uh AFP was a member
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
um really looked at the lessons taken
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
from a lot of these states that surround
 
01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:54.410 align:start position:0%
from a lot of these states that surround
us

01:42:54.410 --> 01:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:42:57.050 --> 01:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
um currently we're uh exporting all of
 
01:42:58.669 --> 01:42:58.679 align:start position:0%
our decision making to neighboring
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
states uh state governments on how a
 
01:43:03.649 --> 01:43:03.659 align:start position:0%
retail cannabis Market should be
 
01:43:05.689 --> 01:43:05.699 align:start position:0%
regulated without getting any of the
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
benefits from that legal Market uh this
 
01:43:10.490 --> 01:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
would shift the power back to the
 
01:43:12.649 --> 01:43:12.659 align:start position:0%
Granite State uh by by putting the
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
decision-making power in your hands and
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
in the hands of the The Liquor
 
01:43:16.679 --> 01:43:18.470 align:start position:0%
in the hands of the The Liquor
Commission

01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:19.010 align:start position:0%
Commission
um

01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:21.290 --> 01:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
this legislation currently as has been
 
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
discussed has a 15 cultivator wholesale
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
tax uh and much of the funds would go
 
01:43:28.129 --> 01:43:28.139 align:start position:0%
towards paying off some of our biggest
 
01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
Financial issues including uh the
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
unfunded pension liability and
 
01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
eventually property taxes
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
um although both both would would go
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
towards reducing property taxes
 
01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:41.209 align:start position:0%
towards reducing property taxes
um

01:43:41.209 --> 01:43:41.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
the original version of this bill uh had
 
01:43:45.129 --> 01:43:45.139 align:start position:0%
a a
 
01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
extended the meals and rooms tax of 8.5
 
01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:51.719 align:start position:0%
percent uh for a retail uh at point of
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
sale tax
 
01:43:53.639 --> 01:43:55.189 align:start position:0%
sale tax
um

01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:58.729 --> 01:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
for for the only only tax uh the the
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
committee shifted that but I'll just uh
 
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
go through why the the commission the
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
the Coalition supported uh and put that
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
in in the original bill so first uh it's
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
an existing tax uh so we're not creating
 
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
any new taxes uh with the meals and
 
01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
rooms tax second it's easy to implement
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh since it would be based on the price
 
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
of product at point of sale uh and
 
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
lastly 8.5 percent would put New
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in an extremely competitive
 
01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
position uh with with our neighboring
 
01:44:31.850 --> 01:44:31.860 align:start position:0%
states it would be uh likely the lowest
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
tax rate in the country on cannabis
 
01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned and and as we've been
 
01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
discussing the house Commerce Committee
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
shifted that tax uh to to a wholesale uh
 
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
paid by uh cannabis plant cultivators uh
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
we're not opposed we're not taking any
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
position one way or the other whether
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's uh retail or or uh wholesale
 
01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
however we do suggest that the the
 
01:44:58.370 --> 01:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
committee ensure the tax is easily
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
implemented in a way that shifts with
 
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
market prices so when the price price of
 
01:45:06.169 --> 01:45:06.179 align:start position:0%
the product inevitably drops uh we're
 
01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
not uh having a prohibitive tax rate
 
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
this has been an issue I think the
 
01:45:14.450 --> 01:45:14.460 align:start position:0%
previous uh speaker mentioned uh Alaska
 
01:45:17.689 --> 01:45:17.699 align:start position:0%
where they have a a dollar amount fixed
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
price on on a weight of a product I
 
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
would highly highly recommend not doing
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
that Most states are trying to undo that
 
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh since the price drops uh so much that
 
01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
the tax could be 50 of the price of the
 
01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:33.890 align:start position:0%
the tax could be 50 of the price of the
product

01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
um the the end goal uh for all of us is
 
01:45:39.169 --> 01:45:39.179 align:start position:0%
is to reduce black market influence so
 
01:45:42.410 --> 01:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
keeping that tax rate low uh and able to
 
01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
fluctuate with the price of the product
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
is is the best way to go in in our mind
 
01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:50.990 align:start position:0%
is is the best way to go in in our mind
um

01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:54.169 --> 01:45:54.179 align:start position:0%
I I'd be happy the one other sort of
 
01:45:58.189 --> 01:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal item I mentioned you know uh the
 
01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
really the the takeaway from every state
 
01:46:02.570 --> 01:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
that is legalized is to keep the
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
regulations and barriers to entry into
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
the industry low uh keep those fees low
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh for for licenses and to keep the
 
01:46:15.530 --> 01:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
taxes as as low as possible
 
01:46:18.109 --> 01:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
um and I do have uh that chart that that
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
was being mentioned I I if if any of the
 
01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
members have questions on what the tax
 
01:46:26.209 --> 01:46:26.219 align:start position:0%
rate is in any of the northeast states I
 
01:46:28.010 --> 01:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
do have those those numbers with me so
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions but
 
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know our our overall message that
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
is that we're in support of this bill
 
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
and uh we encourage the committee to
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
work through the process and and uh pass
 
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
the bill as written
 
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
could you send us that
 
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
schedule or absolutely uh I can just you
 
01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
know just quickly Most states have
 
01:46:53.450 --> 01:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
compounding taxes so they'll they'll
 
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
establish a cannabis retail tax
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes a cannabis wholesale tax on
 
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
top of their uh I I know that in New
 
01:47:01.970 --> 01:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't really know what this
 
01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
is but uh on top of their existing sales
 
01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
taxes in those States uh so it's a
 
01:47:11.570 --> 01:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
compounding uh tax system uh in almost
 
01:47:14.090 --> 01:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
every every state in the region where
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
you have multiple sales taxes usually
 
01:47:20.090 --> 01:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
local excise taxes on top of uh on top
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
of existing taxes
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
if you have a chart that you could email
 
01:47:26.209 --> 01:47:26.219 align:start position:0%
the committee that would be helpful
 
01:47:28.850 --> 01:47:28.860 align:start position:0%
absolutely are you open to questions yes
 
01:47:31.370 --> 01:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
any questions on this side of the room
 
01:47:32.810 --> 01:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
questions on this side representative
 
01:47:35.629 --> 01:47:35.639 align:start position:0%
Bolton uh thank you madam chair so I'm
 
01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
actually looking at the document that
 
01:47:40.850 --> 01:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
you're you're referring to and my
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
concern about an ounce of what so I
 
01:47:45.290 --> 01:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
guess Alaska
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
does have a variety of different charges
 
01:47:51.410 --> 01:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
per ounce one is um fifty dollars per
 
01:47:54.350 --> 01:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
ounce for flowers mature buds 25 per
 
01:47:56.209 --> 01:47:56.219 align:start position:0%
ounce for immature or abnormal buds
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars per ounce for trim any
 
01:48:01.250 --> 01:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
clones whatever that is it's a buck per
 
01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:02.870 align:start position:0%
clones whatever that is it's a buck per
clone

01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
clone
 
01:48:04.669 --> 01:48:04.679 align:start position:0%
um is that
 
01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
a preferable way to go do you think or
 
01:48:08.209 --> 01:48:08.219 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
representative I I would say no
 
01:48:12.890 --> 01:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
um because again
 
01:48:15.290 --> 01:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
when you establish a new industry
 
01:48:17.330 --> 01:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
especially in this area we've seen a
 
01:48:19.729 --> 01:48:19.739 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Main Vermont what have you
 
01:48:21.890 --> 01:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
the the price is usually High to begin
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
with so it could be three hundred
 
01:48:26.330 --> 01:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
dollars per ounce you have a 50 tax on
 
01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
on that uh on that ounce but when the
 
01:48:32.689 --> 01:48:32.699 align:start position:0%
price begins to drop that 50 dollars
 
01:48:35.090 --> 01:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
becomes a massive portion of of what
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
these uh cultivators are looking at
 
01:48:39.890 --> 01:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
paying which might which would likely
 
01:48:41.810 --> 01:48:41.820 align:start position:0%
result in in the price of the product
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
not dropping and and being competitive
 
01:48:47.330 --> 01:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
to knock out the black market uh so so
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
we support the idea of doing a percent
 
01:48:53.629 --> 01:48:53.639 align:start position:0%
base base tax you know we think the 15
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
might be a little high uh I would uh
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
recommend the committee look into the
 
01:49:02.090 --> 01:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
existing tax on Vapes which is eight
 
01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:03.590 align:start position:0%
existing tax on Vapes which is eight
percent

01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:49:07.010 --> 01:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
um uh as a little more uh a lower tax on
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
those cultivators but again uh we're not
 
01:49:13.129 --> 01:49:13.139 align:start position:0%
taking a direct position on on uh tax
 
01:49:13.139 --> 01:49:17.510 align:start position:0%
taking a direct position on on uh tax
rate

01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%

01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Elizabeth Sargent
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
here today
 
01:49:40.189 --> 01:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
um representing the New Hampshire
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police in
 
01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill
 
01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
um I was not prepared to testify I do
 
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
have Chief provensky's testimony he's
 
01:49:52.010 --> 01:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
president of the association and I would
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
just note
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
um and he should try to address the cost
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
and I would note that we would agree
 
01:50:00.410 --> 01:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
with the fiscal note in the bill that
 
01:50:02.450 --> 01:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
there will be increased law enforcement
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
costs increased by highway safety cost
 
01:50:09.770 --> 01:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
and increased addiction cost so
 
01:50:11.810 --> 01:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
um with that I'd be happy to take any
 
01:50:13.609 --> 01:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
questions back to the association but
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
probably don't feel comfortable
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:21.770 --> 01:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative only
 
01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
do we have a copy of this demo oh you're
 
01:50:27.290 --> 01:50:27.300 align:start position:0%
yes you're going to distribute it yes

01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:36.659 align:start position:0%
reach you I think uh that your is your
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%

01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
um no but I'll send it to the committee
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to answer any questions
 
01:50:45.729 --> 01:50:45.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
okay the let's see I have the d-array
 
01:50:51.229 --> 01:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
here do you want to do that now or do we
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
wait till a little bit later what are
 
01:50:55.129 --> 01:50:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
let's let's hold off and do some other
 
01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
folks just so we can ask them all the
 
01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
technical questions I have Nathaniel

thank you thank you

CEO of a company that for about eight
 
01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
years has been providing Financial

executive director of the New Hampshire

cannabis party
 
01:52:39.530 --> 01:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
and I write a
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
bi-monthly column for the Conway Daily
 
01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.209 align:start position:0%
bi-monthly column for the Conway Daily
Sun

01:52:43.209 --> 01:52:43.219 align:start position:0%
Sun
 
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
covering the New Hampshire cannabis
 
01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:47.570 align:start position:0%
covering the New Hampshire cannabis
industry

01:52:47.570 --> 01:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:48.530 align:start position:0%
industry
um

01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
the first thing that it's important to
 
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
talk about I think is that the Cannabis
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
industry is evolving it's very complex
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
um it requires skill sets and experience
 
01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:03.530 align:start position:0%
um it requires skill sets and experience
that

01:53:03.530 --> 01:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:05.450 --> 01:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
um you know are unusual I think that's
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why the Liquor
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
Commission did not have a lot of
 
01:53:11.570 --> 01:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm for running this entire
 
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
um because it's complicated
 
01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:19.550 align:start position:0%
um because it's complicated
um

01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:21.709 --> 01:53:21.719 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
01:53:23.689 --> 01:53:23.699 align:start position:0%
it's very important
 
01:53:25.570 --> 01:53:25.580 align:start position:0%
to stay away from any additional
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
unnecessary complication and talking
 
01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:29.470 align:start position:0%
unnecessary complication and talking
about

01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
trying to set up a revenue or tax
 
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
structure that is based on
 
01:53:40.490 --> 01:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
the eccentricities and individual nature
 
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
of cannabis products such as flour or
 
01:53:47.649 --> 01:53:47.659 align:start position:0%
finished products or potency or weight
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
is going to be a nightmare I think in
 
01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
terms of supervision in terms of having
 
01:53:58.189 --> 01:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
inspectors to take a look at this the
 
01:54:01.129 --> 01:54:01.139 align:start position:0%
entire regulatory regimen in order to
 
01:54:04.250 --> 01:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
try to monitor this adequately is going
 
01:54:07.609 --> 01:54:07.619 align:start position:0%
to be expensive mistake ridden and it's
 
01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
going to create a lot of complex
 
01:54:09.199 --> 01:54:11.109 align:start position:0%
going to create a lot of complex
conflicts

01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
conflicts
 
01:54:13.810 --> 01:54:13.820 align:start position:0%
and on the other hand
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative hunt came up with what I
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
thought was a very elegant and Brilliant
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
and simple suggestion
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
and that is simply to put a percentage
 
01:54:28.010 --> 01:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
tax on cultivators and the reason for
 
01:54:31.330 --> 01:54:31.340 align:start position:0%
that and the the
 
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
inspiration of that is that that that
 
01:54:37.609 --> 01:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
creates basically one toll booth for the
 
01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
entire industry no product is going to
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
get into the market with one exception
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
that I'll get to without being produced
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
by a cultivator or a farmer so that
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
means if you set up one toll booth and
 
01:54:54.350 --> 01:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
tax it okay every other part of the
 
01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
Cannabis economy Downstream will have
 
01:54:58.430 --> 01:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
paid their taxes without having to
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
burden them with filing reports with
 
01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:02.990 align:start position:0%
burden them with filing reports with
um

01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh with having to get inspected and so
 
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
on and if we do not look at the product
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
itself in terms of potency or weight or
 
01:55:15.410 --> 01:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
type of product but all we have to do is
 
01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
track the revenue of the cultivators on
 
01:55:21.050 --> 01:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis at a percentage we have
 
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
an incredibly simple non-invasive uh tax
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
structure that also covers the entire
 
01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:28.970 align:start position:0%
structure that also covers the entire
economy

01:55:28.970 --> 01:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
economy
 
01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:29.689 align:start position:0%
economy
um

01:55:29.689 --> 01:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:29.699 --> 01:55:31.729 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:55:31.729 --> 01:55:31.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:34.729 --> 01:55:34.739 align:start position:0%
it's just vastly simpler and we're not
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
going to get into any trouble with that
 
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
um the um you know thing that to keep in
 
01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
mind also is that at the cultivation
 
01:55:45.229 --> 01:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
level the quality of the product the
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
potency of the product whether it's an
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
outdoor grow or an indoor grow is going
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
to affect the price that they're able to
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
sell it for and so the tax rate will
 
01:55:56.090 --> 01:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
automatically adjust based on the
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
quality of the product the type of
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
product and so on simply because that's
 
01:56:01.729 --> 01:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
there's a market price for different
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
types of products in fact this um
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps deliberately or accidentally
 
01:56:10.609 --> 01:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
also tends to provide a little subsidy
 
01:56:14.050 --> 01:56:14.060 align:start position:0%
for outdoor Farmers because typically
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
outdoor grown product sells for Less in
 
01:56:19.250 --> 01:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
the marketplace and so their tax rate
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
will be lower the guys who are building
 
01:56:24.050 --> 01:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
greenhouses have specialized products
 
01:56:26.090 --> 01:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
that often uh you know they're much more
 
01:56:27.590 --> 01:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
controllable they may have higher
 
01:56:31.010 --> 01:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
potencies they may have more specialized
 
01:56:32.689 --> 01:56:32.699 align:start position:0%
uses and as a result they're going to
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
command a higher price and they'll pay a
 
01:56:36.229 --> 01:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
higher tax
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
um so I am very much in favor of the um
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
tax structure that came out of Commerce
 
01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:45.169 align:start position:0%
tax structure that came out of Commerce
Committee

01:56:45.169 --> 01:56:45.179 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
01:56:47.810 --> 01:56:47.820 align:start position:0%
um and um would really really caution
 
01:56:51.290 --> 01:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
you guys not to uh and pun intended get
 
01:56:53.930 --> 01:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
into the weeds with this uh you know uh
 
01:56:55.729 --> 01:56:55.739 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't need to I mean if
 
01:56:57.890 --> 01:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
interested but but really you don't need
 
01:57:00.290 --> 01:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
to we can accomplish our purpose in a
 
01:57:02.090 --> 01:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
very simple Manner and just track the
 
01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
revenue either on a tax return or bank
 
01:57:06.050 --> 01:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
statements um or whatever from the
 
01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:07.790 align:start position:0%
statements um or whatever from the
cultivators

01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
cultivators
 
01:57:10.850 --> 01:57:10.860 align:start position:0%
um however and this is what I passed out
 
01:57:12.890 --> 01:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
some of this material on
 
01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:13.669 align:start position:0%
some of this material on
um

01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:16.139 align:start position:0%
one thing that
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
is coming is interstate commerce now
 
01:57:22.189 --> 01:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
um the state of New Hampshire can either
 
01:57:25.010 --> 01:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
recognize that and embrace that and have
 
01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:26.810 align:start position:0%
recognize that and embrace that and have
a

01:57:26.810 --> 01:57:26.820 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:57:29.450 --> 01:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
um an industry and a regulatory
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
framework that Embraces that and
 
01:57:33.950 --> 01:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
encourages that and builds our state's
 
01:57:36.290 --> 01:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
prosperity in this industry
 
01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
um recognizing that that's coming or we
 
01:57:41.330 --> 01:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
can have it imposed upon us as you'll
 
01:57:43.010 --> 01:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
see from the material I've passed around
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
it's inevitable
 
01:57:47.810 --> 01:57:47.820 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know the federal courts
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
are going to invalidate state residency
 
01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:53.050 align:start position:0%
are going to invalidate state residency
requirements

01:57:53.050 --> 01:57:53.060 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
largely as a result of that and they are
 
01:57:58.750 --> 01:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
going to invalidate States
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
practicing having kind of a insulated
 
01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
bubble economy that's what has evolved
 
01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
in the industry at this particular point
 
01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
but those barriers are soon to break
 
01:58:12.530 --> 01:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
down and we need to be aware of that and
 
01:58:14.149 --> 01:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
the reason why that's important on a
 
01:58:18.530 --> 01:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
revenue basis is because not if but when
 
01:58:21.410 --> 01:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
product is imported from other states
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
if we are only taxing our local domestic
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
um cultivators then we are going to put
 
01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
them all at a huge disadvantage over
 
01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
product that gets imported in
 
01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
so by simply amending the current
 
01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:38.030 align:start position:0%
so by simply amending the current
um

01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh proposal to say that tax is on
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
cultivators and importers
 
01:58:46.490 --> 01:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
we have now actually covered the entire
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
market so if you're growing it or
 
01:58:50.209 --> 01:58:50.219 align:start position:0%
producing it here in New Hampshire
 
01:58:52.609 --> 01:58:52.619 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay that tax it'll go
 
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
Downstream 15 percent is not as scary a
 
01:58:57.649 --> 01:58:57.659 align:start position:0%
number as it seems because it's at a
 
01:59:00.109 --> 01:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
wholesale price so that's really kind of
 
01:59:01.970 --> 01:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
where the the that kind of like the
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
bottom of the pricing obviously as it
 
01:59:06.169 --> 01:59:06.179 align:start position:0%
moves up towards manufacturing and
 
01:59:09.229 --> 01:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
retailing the cost of the product is
 
01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
higher and so the effective tax because
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
it was taxed at the wholesale level was
 
01:59:14.159 --> 01:59:15.229 align:start position:0%
it was taxed at the wholesale level was
lower

01:59:15.229 --> 01:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
lower
 
01:59:18.589 --> 01:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
I think that it's um that it's very
 
01:59:20.990 --> 01:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
compelling that instead of having a 10
 
01:59:24.530 --> 01:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
tax on cultivation and then five percent
 
01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
on retail that we do 15 right at that
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
right at that one toll booth level
 
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
um and um and then we're able to
 
01:59:37.129 --> 01:59:37.139 align:start position:0%
advertise and uh you know our retailers
 
01:59:39.470 --> 01:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
dispensaries delivery services and so on
 
01:59:41.930 --> 01:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
will be able to say that you can come to
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and buy cannabis tax-free
 
01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
there's no extra tax on it at all and
 
01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
we're covering it now five the the extra
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
five percent on a cultivation level
 
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
obviously is worth less than five
 
01:59:55.370 --> 01:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
percent on a retail level but
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
nonetheless it would it would give us a
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
compelling advantage and would give
 
02:00:01.490 --> 02:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
um our business operators a compelling
 
02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:02.810 align:start position:0%
um our business operators a compelling
Advantage

02:00:02.810 --> 02:00:02.820 align:start position:0%
Advantage
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
um the other thing to also keep in mind
 
02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
um and um uh the representative uh here
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh who's
 
02:00:11.930 --> 02:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
can't actually read your name but um
 
02:00:13.370 --> 02:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
alluded to it
 
02:00:16.970 --> 02:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
um is that um in addition to the core
 
02:00:19.250 --> 02:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
industry cultivators dispensaries
 
02:00:21.709 --> 02:00:21.719 align:start position:0%
manufacturers test Labs uh people who
 
02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
are actually involved in the the prime
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis activity
 
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure you're all well aware that
 
02:00:31.070 --> 02:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
there are many many support industries
 
02:00:33.229 --> 02:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
that uh that help this industry there's
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
Hospitality there's greenhouses there's
 
02:00:38.930 --> 02:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
equipment there's Transportation there's
 
02:00:40.850 --> 02:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
legal and accounting services a whole
 
02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
the whole economy gets boosted by that
 
02:00:47.570 --> 02:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
as well as the core industry and as they
 
02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
grow and flourish and start generating
 
02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:51.109 align:start position:0%
grow and flourish and start generating
profits

02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
profits
 
02:00:51.119 --> 02:00:52.010 align:start position:0%
profits
um

02:00:52.010 --> 02:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:55.490 --> 02:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
generally speaking unless the tax burden
 
02:00:57.649 --> 02:00:57.659 align:start position:0%
like it is in California is crazy and
 
02:00:57.659 --> 02:00:58.910 align:start position:0%
like it is in California is crazy and
excessive

02:00:58.910 --> 02:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
excessive
 
02:01:02.169 --> 02:01:02.179 align:start position:0%
um the the mere elevation and increase
 
02:01:05.149 --> 02:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
in overall business activity and
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
prosperity is likely to generate lots
 
02:01:10.010 --> 02:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
more revenue for our standard business
 
02:01:12.890 --> 02:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
taxes than it would even generate just
 
02:01:15.649 --> 02:01:15.659 align:start position:0%
on the on the core cannabis taxes so I
 
02:01:18.830 --> 02:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
think having a a modest tax of 15 at the
 
02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
cultivation and importation level would
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
basically cover that in addition keep in
 
02:01:27.290 --> 02:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
mind that products that get imported
 
02:01:30.169 --> 02:01:30.179 align:start position:0%
into the state may not be simply flower
 
02:01:32.890 --> 02:01:32.900 align:start position:0%
that would be generated by the
 
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
cultivators but it could be gummy bears
 
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
it could be finished products it could
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
be and so of course if they come into
 
02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
the state as finished products they're
 
02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:43.139 align:start position:0%
also going to get taxed at a higher rate
 
02:01:45.169 --> 02:01:45.179 align:start position:0%
because you know they're more of a
 
02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
value-added product
 
02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:48.709 align:start position:0%
value-added product
um

02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
so anyway those those are kind of the
 
02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
main points
 
02:02:00.410 --> 02:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
I think it's also important um simply to
 
02:02:03.119 --> 02:02:03.950 align:start position:0%
I think it's also important um simply to
mention

02:02:03.950 --> 02:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
mention
 
02:02:07.070 --> 02:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
um that um the Cannabis industry as it's
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
currently constructed
 
02:02:11.149 --> 02:02:11.159 align:start position:0%
um and uh for a lot of reasons because
 
02:02:13.330 --> 02:02:13.340 align:start position:0%
of the tension between Federal
 
02:02:17.089 --> 02:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
illegality and state legality there's a
 
02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of supervision and
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
compliance that goes part and parcel
 
02:02:23.089 --> 02:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
with the Cannabis industry right now so
 
02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
not only at the cultivation level but at
 
02:02:28.129 --> 02:02:28.139 align:start position:0%
all levels retail manufacturing there's
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
very close monitoring of inventory and
 
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
pricing and point-of-sale proceeds and
 
02:02:37.070 --> 02:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
making sure that the operators stay on
 
02:02:38.689 --> 02:02:38.699 align:start position:0%
the straight and narrow and that's not
 
02:02:41.089 --> 02:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
just on the cultivation level retailers
 
02:02:43.010 --> 02:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
are required to have their inventory
 
02:02:45.649 --> 02:02:45.659 align:start position:0%
tracked by the state and by the Banks
 
02:02:47.890 --> 02:02:47.900 align:start position:0%
and by their financial service providers
 
02:02:51.010 --> 02:02:51.020 align:start position:0%
their point of sale systems are tracked
 
02:02:54.050 --> 02:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
and so uh
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
it's very easy to tell whether they're
 
02:03:00.589 --> 02:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
straying out of their Lane and that's at
 
02:03:02.930 --> 02:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
all different levels of the industry
 
02:03:04.729 --> 02:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
um so and the only other thing I'll
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
mention is that um you know I do have
 
02:03:09.890 --> 02:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of knowledge and
 
02:03:11.330 --> 02:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
understanding on the Banking and
 
02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
Financial Services and payments issues
 
02:03:15.290 --> 02:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
so if they relate to anything that
 
02:03:16.970 --> 02:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
you're looking at at this moment we'll
 
02:03:21.050 --> 02:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative Phillips thank you madam
 
02:03:26.089 --> 02:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
chair I want to thank you for pointing
 
02:03:27.250 --> 02:03:27.260 align:start position:0%
out that
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
your assumption that we will eventually
 
02:03:33.890 --> 02:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
just have interstate commerce because I
 
02:03:35.629 --> 02:03:35.639 align:start position:0%
think you're right in it I hadn't been
 
02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
thinking along those lines
 
02:03:41.810 --> 02:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
um what I don't understand though is if
 
02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
if we assume that that's going to happen
 
02:03:47.450 --> 02:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
I don't understand while you why you are
 
02:03:51.050 --> 02:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
still suggesting taxing it at the
 
02:03:52.490 --> 02:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
wholesale level
 
02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
and then saying that gummies will be
 
02:04:00.109 --> 02:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
taxed when they are transported into
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
this state
 
02:04:04.010 --> 02:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
because I think that sounds very
 
02:04:05.930 --> 02:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
complicated it seems to me that if we're
 
02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
going to have interstate commerce we
 
02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
should just have a have a tax at the
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
retail level so can you tell me why
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
that's not the best solution well you
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
have to Yes um you have to keep in mind
 
02:04:19.550 --> 02:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of channels of
 
02:04:20.930 --> 02:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
distribution here
 
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
um gummy bears could come in to the
 
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
state and maybe some of them will get
 
02:04:29.570 --> 02:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
retailed some of them may get wholesaled
 
02:04:31.729 --> 02:04:31.739 align:start position:0%
some of them may get re-exported out to
 
02:04:35.330 --> 02:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
other states they may ultimately get
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
into International you know
 
02:04:38.770 --> 02:04:38.780 align:start position:0%
International Commerce
 
02:04:43.010 --> 02:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
and if we do not have a mechanism to
 
02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:44.410 align:start position:0%
and if we do not have a mechanism to
basically

02:04:44.410 --> 02:04:44.420 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:04:48.290 --> 02:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
tax everything as simply as possible and
 
02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
without again looking at the
 
02:04:50.639 --> 02:04:51.169 align:start position:0%
without again looking at the
um

02:04:51.169 --> 02:04:51.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:52.850 --> 02:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
particularly you know the individual
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
characteristics of the product but
 
02:04:57.169 --> 02:04:57.179 align:start position:0%
everything that basically is either
 
02:05:00.169 --> 02:05:00.179 align:start position:0%
produced in a state or there's Commerce
 
02:05:02.930 --> 02:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
in the state that the simplest way to
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
Simply impose a uh you know basic and
 
02:05:07.550 --> 02:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
modest tax on that I think would be the
 
02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
best uh you know and so you know
 
02:05:11.930 --> 02:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
especially as distribution begins to
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
open up and is is less controlled within
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:05:16.729 --> 02:05:16.739 align:start position:0%
um you know we don't want to have a lot
 
02:05:19.729 --> 02:05:19.739 align:start position:0%
of these large loopholes that uh you
 
02:05:21.229 --> 02:05:21.239 align:start position:0%
know clever operators are going to find
 
02:05:23.330 --> 02:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
a way through so if we have if we kind
 
02:05:26.270 --> 02:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
of establish as I said one toll booth
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay that everybody has to go through
 
02:05:29.870 --> 02:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
and then at that point in time they can
 
02:05:31.970 --> 02:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
freely trade and the tax has been paid
 
02:05:33.830 --> 02:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
and we don't have to track that anymore
 
02:05:36.109 --> 02:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
I think that would be the simplest way
 
02:05:39.010 --> 02:05:39.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative ulery and then
 
02:05:43.250 --> 02:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative almi
 
02:05:46.490 --> 02:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh in your review
 
02:05:47.810 --> 02:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:50.030 align:start position:0%
of this bill
um

02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:53.330 --> 02:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
the base tax the toll booth as you talk
 
02:05:56.270 --> 02:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
on is that based on net revenue or gross
 
02:05:58.250 --> 02:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
revenue in your understanding of the
 
02:05:58.260 --> 02:05:59.390 align:start position:0%
revenue in your understanding of the
bill

02:05:59.390 --> 02:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
oh that would certainly be gross revenue
 
02:06:06.050 --> 02:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
so business taxes and our business
 
02:06:08.030 --> 02:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
expenses and such would not be
 
02:06:10.370 --> 02:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
deductible from the gross revenue
 
02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
generated well I don't think it's
 
02:06:14.689 --> 02:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
contemplated to be an income tax uh you
 
02:06:16.850 --> 02:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
know it's a it's essentially a sales tax
 
02:06:19.129 --> 02:06:19.139 align:start position:0%
so whatever you sell the product for you
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
pay the tax on that on that basis
 
02:06:25.250 --> 02:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative homie
 
02:06:28.850 --> 02:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you how do you propose
 
02:06:32.089 --> 02:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
that we figure out what's been imported
 
02:06:32.099 --> 02:06:33.709 align:start position:0%
that we figure out what's been imported
once

02:06:33.709 --> 02:06:33.719 align:start position:0%
once
 
02:06:37.629 --> 02:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
once Commerce is made free and easy
 
02:06:39.890 --> 02:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
across all of our borders which
 
02:06:45.470 --> 02:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:46.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
I haven't thought that mechanism through
 
02:06:51.169 --> 02:06:51.179 align:start position:0%
be perfectly honest I think that that's
 
02:06:53.890 --> 02:06:53.900 align:start position:0%
certainly something that uh would not be
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh you know super difficult to design
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
something like that but to be perfectly
 
02:07:02.330 --> 02:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
honest I didn't I mean I I think it's
 
02:07:05.089 --> 02:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
it's perfectly doable but I don't have a
 
02:07:07.010 --> 02:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
mechanism that I have thought through on
 
02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:09.350 align:start position:0%
mechanism that I have thought through on
that

02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
questions on the other side of the room
 
02:07:14.330 --> 02:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
in the committee no any other follow-ups
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative alright
 
02:07:19.609 --> 02:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
to discuss your Interstate Karma right
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
now it's illegal interstate commerce was
 
02:07:25.010 --> 02:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
regulated by the federal government uh
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's something we don't have to worry
 
02:07:29.330 --> 02:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
about at this point uh until they figure
 
02:07:32.089 --> 02:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
out the tax and legality issue at the
 
02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
02:07:35.629 --> 02:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
we don't have to worry about it is there
 
02:07:37.550 --> 02:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
a question representing illegal don't
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
you agree with me
 
02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you got around to a question uh
 
02:07:46.490 --> 02:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
no it's actually not illegal the
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
interesting thing is um there is an
 
02:07:50.990 --> 02:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
assumption I mean of course
 
02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.490 align:start position:0%
assumption I mean of course
um

02:07:52.490 --> 02:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:55.970 --> 02:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
any involvement in aiding and abetting
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
narcotics trafficking uh
 
02:08:02.410 --> 02:08:02.420 align:start position:0%
according to federal law is illegal
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
arguably if we have a conversation about
 
02:08:09.649 --> 02:08:09.659 align:start position:0%
possibly uh uh cannabis Commerce we're
 
02:08:11.709 --> 02:08:11.719 align:start position:0%
breaking federal law
 
02:08:16.250 --> 02:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
however the feds have a not weighed in
 
02:08:19.070 --> 02:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
on interstate commerce of cannabis they
 
02:08:21.229 --> 02:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
don't have an actual prohibition they
 
02:08:23.810 --> 02:08:23.820 align:start position:0%
have the right to regulate it within a
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
narrowly confined framework which is
 
02:08:28.609 --> 02:08:28.619 align:start position:0%
discussed in the material that I gave
 
02:08:31.490 --> 02:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
you but at this particular moment and
 
02:08:32.930 --> 02:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
this has actually been the holding of
 
02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
several courts some of the material
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
which is in the things that I sent out
 
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
to you it is not currently illegal to
 
02:08:42.770 --> 02:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
engage in interstate commerce the reason
 
02:08:46.370 --> 02:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
why interstate commerce is prohibited is
 
02:08:49.550 --> 02:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
because every state has prohibited it in
 
02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:55.790 --> 02:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually
 
02:08:57.770 --> 02:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
you know for you know I having been
 
02:09:00.169 --> 02:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
involved in banking and and payments for
 
02:09:01.490 --> 02:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
a very long time
 
02:09:04.010 --> 02:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
um there's a misnomer that there is a
 
02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
restriction on the federal level as
 
02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
regards Banking and credit cards and all
 
02:09:10.070 --> 02:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
the rest of that that's actually not
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
true the entire restriction emanates
 
02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.010 align:start position:0%
true the entire restriction emanates
from

02:09:13.010 --> 02:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
um the individual Banks and the credit
 
02:09:17.209 --> 02:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
card companies who choose not to do
 
02:09:19.129 --> 02:09:19.139 align:start position:0%
business in this industry but actually
 
02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
all of this is uh you know it's not
 
02:09:23.629 --> 02:09:23.639 align:start position:0%
federally legal but it's federally
 
02:09:23.639 --> 02:09:25.550 align:start position:0%
federally legal but it's federally
permitted

02:09:25.550 --> 02:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
permitted
 
02:09:28.070 --> 02:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative horse thank you madam
 
02:09:29.629 --> 02:09:29.639 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
question so you mentioned earlier in
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
your testimony about the current New
 
02:09:36.649 --> 02:09:36.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis industry what is the
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire cannabis industry I mean
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
are we talking I don't know I have no
 
02:09:44.089 --> 02:09:44.099 align:start position:0%
idea so I mean are do we do we sell
 
02:09:46.129 --> 02:09:46.139 align:start position:0%
brownies and gummy bears or you know
 
02:09:49.189 --> 02:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
give out free pizza or what do we do uh
 
02:09:51.410 --> 02:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
well um if you mean um from in the
 
02:09:55.010 --> 02:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
context of my um covering the New
 
02:09:58.070 --> 02:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis industry uh in um in
 
02:10:00.050 --> 02:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
my column uh it would be really
 
02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
developments in the New Hampshire
 
02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
cannabis industry right now the New
 
02:10:05.629 --> 02:10:05.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis industry consists of
 
02:10:07.810 --> 02:10:07.820 align:start position:0%
a few
 
02:10:10.129 --> 02:10:10.139 align:start position:0%
atcs which are vertically integrated
 
02:10:11.930 --> 02:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
that grow their own product and produce
 
02:10:13.609 --> 02:10:13.619 align:start position:0%
their own product and I guess that's our
 
02:10:16.669 --> 02:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
cannabis industry um but in the scope of
 
02:10:19.370 --> 02:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
what I'm writing about uh you know all
 
02:10:21.530 --> 02:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
of what we're doing here is kind of part
 
02:10:24.050 --> 02:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
of the Cannabis industry per se
 
02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:25.729 align:start position:0%
of the Cannabis industry per se
follow-up

02:10:25.729 --> 02:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:10:29.450 --> 02:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
so is it legal to grow cannabis in New
 
02:10:32.089 --> 02:10:32.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and
 
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
sell it or give it away or what well my
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it's legal if you
 
02:10:40.490 --> 02:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
have an ATC license to grow it for the
 
02:10:42.729 --> 02:10:42.739 align:start position:0%
purpose of providing product to your
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
business is that medical use yes yeah
 
02:10:48.609 --> 02:10:48.619 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair
 
02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question you say
 
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
several several all states or several
 
02:11:01.490 --> 02:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
States block Imports so it's going to be
 
02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
State grown doesn't it fly right in the
 
02:11:08.570 --> 02:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:08.580 --> 02:11:09.649 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:11:09.649 --> 02:11:09.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:11.089 --> 02:11:11.099 align:start position:0%
well actually
 
02:11:13.609 --> 02:11:13.619 align:start position:0%
um the answer to your question is
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
um very thoroughly answered by the
 
02:11:17.570 --> 02:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
material that I passed out but
 
02:11:17.580 --> 02:11:19.550 align:start position:0%
material that I passed out but
essentially

02:11:19.550 --> 02:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:20.450 align:start position:0%
essentially
um

02:11:20.450 --> 02:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:23.089 --> 02:11:23.099 align:start position:0%
the the strong argument that it looks
 
02:11:25.370 --> 02:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
like uh the court the courts are already
 
02:11:27.410 --> 02:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
deciding in this way and it looks like
 
02:11:28.850 --> 02:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
they're all pretty much going to fall in
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
line with this is that based on the
 
02:11:33.589 --> 02:11:33.599 align:start position:0%
dormant Commerce Clause
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
um that um in point of fact the states
 
02:11:39.790 --> 02:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
have no right to prohibit Interstate uh
 
02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
Commerce and are doing so
 
02:11:46.250 --> 02:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
um for a variety of reasons which are
 
02:11:48.530 --> 02:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
addressed in the material I gave you but
 
02:11:50.450 --> 02:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
um from what I recall
 
02:11:53.390 --> 02:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
um One is because they think that the
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
feds might be prohibiting it and they're
 
02:11:57.770 --> 02:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
anticipating that or they're looking to
 
02:12:00.350 --> 02:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps lessen the tension between
 
02:12:04.129 --> 02:12:04.139 align:start position:0%
federal and state law number two
 
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
um they are you know likely motivated to
 
02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
try to protect their local nascent
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know just developing
 
02:12:14.750 --> 02:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis industry from Interstate
 
02:12:17.089 --> 02:12:17.099 align:start position:0%
competition but that actually happens to
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
be in direct contradiction to the inter
 
02:12:25.609 --> 02:12:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:27.530 --> 02:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative alming
 
02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you when I was a student
 
02:12:34.810 --> 02:12:34.820 align:start position:0%
which is a very long time ago I remember
 
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
on learning that the reason we had no
 
02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
research on the effects of cannabis was
 
02:12:45.550 --> 02:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
that the U.S department of Agriculture
 
02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
would not allow anyone to grow cannabis
 
02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:52.430 align:start position:0%
would not allow anyone to grow cannabis
on

02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:12:56.689 --> 02:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:59.450 --> 02:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
you're telling me that all of this is a
 
02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:01.069 align:start position:0%
you're telling me that all of this is a
mirage

02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
mirage
 
02:13:05.450 --> 02:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry um what's a mirage that
 
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
that the federal government has a
 
02:13:11.390 --> 02:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
Prohibition against the
 
02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:12.069 align:start position:0%
Prohibition against the
the

02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:13:12.079 --> 02:13:13.689 align:start position:0%
the
ice

02:13:13.689 --> 02:13:13.699 align:start position:0%
ice
 
02:13:17.209 --> 02:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
growth and and on
 
02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
use of cannabis
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:27.830 --> 02:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh classifies it as a schedule one
 
02:13:30.649 --> 02:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
narcotic with no benefit
 
02:13:33.530 --> 02:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
um and um state law individual state
 
02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
laws contradict that directly
 
02:13:39.950 --> 02:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
um and the um the federal law um still
 
02:13:41.569 --> 02:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
prevails and you're absolutely right
 
02:13:43.310 --> 02:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
about the research uh it was actually
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
prohibited by the DEA
 
02:13:48.649 --> 02:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
um who apparently had issued one license
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
to one Southern University to grow some
 
02:13:55.370 --> 02:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
crops for research um but certainly the
 
02:13:57.649 --> 02:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
research has been severely constrained
 
02:14:00.410 --> 02:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
by the federal prohibition and and it it
 
02:14:03.229 --> 02:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
remains federally illegal today uh
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh you know there have been
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
um there there was a um starting in 2014
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
there was a amendment that was attached
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
to the federal budget which is renewed
 
02:14:17.089 --> 02:14:17.099 align:start position:0%
every year so far since then which
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
prohibits the Department of Justice from
 
02:14:24.410 --> 02:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting anyone one involved in a um
 
02:14:26.510 --> 02:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
you know properly constituted state
 
02:14:31.250 --> 02:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
legal program but that does not relieve
 
02:14:31.260 --> 02:14:31.850 align:start position:0%
legal program but that does not relieve
um

02:14:31.850 --> 02:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:34.850 --> 02:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
anyone from the fact that that all of
 
02:14:36.649 --> 02:14:36.659 align:start position:0%
these all of these cannabis businesses
 
02:14:38.569 --> 02:14:38.579 align:start position:0%
and the entire industry and all the
 
02:14:40.669 --> 02:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
state sanctioned operations are in
 
02:14:43.370 --> 02:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
violation of federal law
 
02:14:45.290 --> 02:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
um you know likewise on the the banking
 
02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:46.069 align:start position:0%
um you know likewise on the the banking
side

02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
side
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
um uh the Department of Treasury through
 
02:14:51.410 --> 02:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
their fincen uh uh federal financial
 
02:14:53.629 --> 02:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
crimes uh enforcement division that
 
02:14:55.370 --> 02:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
regulates Banks and compliance and all
 
02:14:56.569 --> 02:14:56.579 align:start position:0%
the rest of that
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
um issued a memo in 2014 that
 
02:15:01.490 --> 02:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
specifically provided guidelines for
 
02:15:05.450 --> 02:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
banks and financial service providers to
 
02:15:08.810 --> 02:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
um they describe it as meet their
 
02:15:11.270 --> 02:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
anti-money laundering and other
 
02:15:13.330 --> 02:15:13.340 align:start position:0%
compliance requirements
 
02:15:15.890 --> 02:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
by following guidelines that they had
 
02:15:17.569 --> 02:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
outlined for doing that but they
 
02:15:19.970 --> 02:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
specifically also said in that memo that
 
02:15:22.850 --> 02:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
the memo does not therefore legalize it
 
02:15:25.010 --> 02:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
in any particular way nor does it affect
 
02:15:26.810 --> 02:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
the fact that that even though the bank
 
02:15:28.609 --> 02:15:28.619 align:start position:0%
might be in in compliance with their
 
02:15:30.709 --> 02:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
examination standards and might be able
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
to therefore Bank people in the industry
 
02:15:35.330 --> 02:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
that nonetheless that doesn't relieve
 
02:15:37.729 --> 02:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
the fact that all of such activity is is
 
02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
being done in violation of federal law
 
02:15:42.890 --> 02:15:42.900 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna thank you very much for
 
02:15:44.750 --> 02:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
all your knowledge and testimony and
 
02:15:46.370 --> 02:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
just remind the committee that we are
 
02:15:48.890 --> 02:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
focused on the revenue if you are
 
02:15:50.569 --> 02:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
certainly welcome to do any of the
 
02:15:52.370 --> 02:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
research on the background we're meeting
 
02:15:53.930 --> 02:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
some great experts in the field but
 
02:15:55.729 --> 02:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
let's try to keep this focused on the
 
02:15:58.910 --> 02:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:01.550 --> 02:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
okay and I will let everyone know
 
02:16:03.350 --> 02:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
because I can see people squirming a
 
02:16:04.850 --> 02:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
little bit we are going to do a hard
 
02:16:06.350 --> 02:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
stop at noon
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
so that my committee members can have a
 
02:16:09.709 --> 02:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
lunch break
 
02:16:10.910 --> 02:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
um so we're going to try to get through
 
02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
the rest of the pink cards so if
 
02:16:13.550 --> 02:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
everyone could just be a little bit
 
02:16:15.470 --> 02:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
concise in your remarks that would be
 
02:16:19.250 --> 02:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
helpful or we will have to uh recess the
 
02:16:21.890 --> 02:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
the hearing and start it over next week
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
or two weeks from now okay
 
02:16:27.129 --> 02:16:27.139 align:start position:0%
representative Jim no excuse me uh Jim R
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
representing himself from Hillsboro I
 
02:16:30.770 --> 02:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
cannot read your last name if you could
 
02:16:40.870 --> 02:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:43.790 --> 02:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:16:45.110 --> 02:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
all right we'll have to meet in two
 
02:16:47.570 --> 02:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
weeks welcome thank you thank you madam
 
02:16:49.129 --> 02:16:49.139 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee my name
 
02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
from Hillsboro and I'm here to support
 
02:17:00.830 --> 02:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 639
 
02:17:03.589 --> 02:17:03.599 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to let you know that I have
 
02:17:07.129 --> 02:17:07.139 align:start position:0%
a USDA hemp producer license
 
02:17:08.990 --> 02:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
brought it with me here
 
02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.030 align:start position:0%
brought it with me here
officially

02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
officially
 
02:17:15.889 --> 02:17:15.899 align:start position:0%
granted by USDA for growing hemp
 
02:17:19.549 --> 02:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
under the terms of my license
 
02:17:23.150 --> 02:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm required to destroy or remediate any
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
plant materials that contain more than
 
02:17:29.450 --> 02:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
0.3 percent THC
 
02:17:32.570 --> 02:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
so I can grow those plants but every lot
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
has to be individually sampled tested if
 
02:17:39.530 --> 02:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
it's hot if it's above 0.3 then there
 
02:17:42.650 --> 02:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
needs to be either composting burying
 
02:17:45.169 --> 02:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
burning or remediation which means
 
02:17:47.089 --> 02:17:47.099 align:start position:0%
mixing with some other product
 
02:17:49.009 --> 02:17:49.019 align:start position:0%
to bring that level down
 
02:17:51.770 --> 02:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
now my own interest business interest is
 
02:17:54.730 --> 02:17:54.740 align:start position:0%
in producing seeds so I don't mind
 
02:17:57.049 --> 02:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
destroying composting I love to make
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
compost anyway so I don't mind turning
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
that into compost but it is a
 
02:18:07.009 --> 02:18:07.019 align:start position:0%
potentially marketable product if this
 
02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
bill is passed and signed into law
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
and I do stand ready to invest in the
 
02:18:14.810 --> 02:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
Cannabis side here in New Hampshire if
 
02:18:16.610 --> 02:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
it indeed is signed into law but I
 
02:18:18.530 --> 02:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
cannot do that right now I can only
 
02:18:22.610 --> 02:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
focus on the seed and speaking of seeds
 
02:18:25.370 --> 02:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh I urge you to make one small change
 
02:18:27.950 --> 02:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh to this bill in in the definition of
 
02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:28.969 align:start position:0%
uh to this bill in in the definition of
cannabis

02:18:28.969 --> 02:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
02:18:31.730 --> 02:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
it lists seeds under the definition of
 
02:18:36.290 --> 02:18:36.300 align:start position:0%
cannabis and if you're not aware the DEA
 
02:18:39.290 --> 02:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
The Drug Enforcement Administration has
 
02:18:41.929 --> 02:18:41.939 align:start position:0%
officially ruled that cannabis seeds are
 
02:18:41.939 --> 02:18:43.250 align:start position:0%
officially ruled that cannabis seeds are
hemp

02:18:43.250 --> 02:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
hemp
 
02:18:46.129 --> 02:18:46.139 align:start position:0%
because they contain less than 0.3
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
percent THC
 
02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
and uh the I have copies of the dea's
 
02:18:55.250 --> 02:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
determination letter with me and it says
 
02:18:58.969 --> 02:18:58.979 align:start position:0%
specifically marijuana seeds that seed
 
02:19:02.690 --> 02:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
that has a Delta 9 THC concentration of
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
not more than
 
02:19:08.929 --> 02:19:08.939 align:start position:0%
0.3 percent on a dry weight basis meets
 
02:19:11.410 --> 02:19:11.420 align:start position:0%
the definition of hemp and is not
 
02:19:13.310 --> 02:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
controlled under the Controlled
 
02:19:15.770 --> 02:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
Substances Act
 
02:19:17.870 --> 02:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
um and all seed
 
02:19:20.509 --> 02:19:20.519 align:start position:0%
hemp seed cannabis seed whatever you
 
02:19:24.230 --> 02:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
want to call it is below 0.3 percent THC
 
02:19:30.410 --> 02:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
so I do encourage you to amend uh the
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
bill because it really affects what
 
02:19:34.370 --> 02:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
would be taxed
 
02:19:36.049 --> 02:19:36.059 align:start position:0%
um and it uh
 
02:19:39.049 --> 02:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
where'd my copy of the bill
 
02:19:41.089 --> 02:19:41.099 align:start position:0%
I don't think I need to read through the
 
02:19:42.650 --> 02:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
exact language but under the definition
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
of cannabis any of the inclusion of
 
02:19:48.589 --> 02:19:48.599 align:start position:0%
seeds in that definition should be
 
02:19:48.599 --> 02:19:50.150 align:start position:0%
seeds in that definition should be
deleted

02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
deleted
 
02:19:54.590 --> 02:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:57.410 --> 02:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
and to add the word seeds
 
02:19:59.690 --> 02:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
uh in the sentence that says cannabis
 
02:20:02.210 --> 02:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
shall not include hemp and then it
 
02:20:04.490 --> 02:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
should say seeds fiber produced from the
 
02:20:07.310 --> 02:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
stock soil cake Etc
 
02:20:09.650 --> 02:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:20:11.450 --> 02:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
that's the one
 
02:20:14.090 --> 02:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
substantive change otherwise
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
as a potential cultivator
 
02:20:21.050 --> 02:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
15 seems high
 
02:20:22.969 --> 02:20:22.979 align:start position:0%
seems like it could generate a lot of
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
money for the state and you said you
 
02:20:26.750 --> 02:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
didn't want it to be an income generator
 
02:20:29.090 --> 02:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
I would think something in the range of
 
02:20:31.870 --> 02:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
half of that would be reasonable
 
02:20:34.250 --> 02:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
seven and a half eight percent at most
 
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
ten percent
 
02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:37.730 align:start position:0%
ten percent
this

02:20:37.730 --> 02:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:20:41.389 --> 02:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
could give Farmers entrepreneurs a lot
 
02:20:43.849 --> 02:20:43.859 align:start position:0%
of opportunity here in New Hampshire to
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
participate in a growing market right
 
02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
now as you know people are going to
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
Maine they're going to Massachusetts New
 
02:20:50.929 --> 02:20:50.939 align:start position:0%
York Vermont
 
02:20:53.809 --> 02:20:53.819 align:start position:0%
Etc we're losing money from our state we
 
02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
can capture that and help support
 
02:20:59.150 --> 02:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
Growers here and I really encourage
 
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
keeping the outdoor cultivation language
 
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
it's not for the state to micromanage
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
how a farmer conducts their business
 
02:21:07.790 --> 02:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's in a greenhouse whether
 
02:21:10.010 --> 02:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
it's hydroponic or whether it's outdoors
 
02:21:12.410 --> 02:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
and being done biodynamically that's up
 
02:21:14.750 --> 02:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
to the grower not the state to make that
 
02:21:18.170 --> 02:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
choice and I did have one suggestion uh
 
02:21:21.530 --> 02:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
also uh to for you to consider on page
 
02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
22 the discussion of that five percent
 
02:21:28.929 --> 02:21:28.939 align:start position:0%
uh of the income going to municipalities
 
02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
there is objection or concerns about
 
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
with a retail store but I would suggest
 
02:21:38.450 --> 02:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
that be changed to a cannabis
 
02:21:40.849 --> 02:21:40.859 align:start position:0%
cultivation facility
 
02:21:43.130 --> 02:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
so if municipality has an operational
 
02:21:46.250 --> 02:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
cannabis cultivation facility they would
 
02:21:48.290 --> 02:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
qualify because these are the entities
 
02:21:51.230 --> 02:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
you're asking to pay the tax the
 
02:21:53.330 --> 02:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities it would make
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
sense that the revenue generated a
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
portion of that comes back to those
 
02:22:00.889 --> 02:22:00.899 align:start position:0%
municipalities where those cultivation
 
02:22:04.190 --> 02:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
facilities are located
 
02:22:05.929 --> 02:22:05.939 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd be happy to take any
 
02:22:05.939 --> 02:22:08.809 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd be happy to take any
questions

02:22:08.809 --> 02:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:10.429 --> 02:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
what about me
 
02:22:13.010 --> 02:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I have not been able to find
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
out what's willing to get involved in
 
02:22:21.650 --> 02:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
this program because they think they'll
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
be taken over by the conglomerates
 
02:22:28.670 --> 02:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh and because it costs a great deal to
 
02:22:33.170 --> 02:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
do indoors on Outdoors
 
02:22:36.889 --> 02:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
on in other states I believe that they
 
02:22:41.830 --> 02:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
are doing a considerable amount of of
 
02:22:44.530 --> 02:22:44.540 align:start position:0%
inspections and
 
02:22:47.929 --> 02:22:47.939 align:start position:0%
requirements of how you grow it since it
 
02:22:52.370 --> 02:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
is going to be used internally
 
02:22:54.910 --> 02:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
do you
 
02:23:00.050 --> 02:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
have an idea of how many people might be
 
02:23:02.929 --> 02:23:02.939 align:start position:0%
willing to try to Do It Outdoors because
 
02:23:06.830 --> 02:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:08.990 --> 02:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
I have no idea how many people in New
 
02:23:10.370 --> 02:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire might be interested in doing
 
02:23:12.410 --> 02:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
it Outdoors thank you and Madam chair
 
02:23:14.990 --> 02:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:15.650 align:start position:0%
and representative
um

02:23:15.650 --> 02:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
I do think for the smaller grower which
 
02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
would be what my interest is totally
 
02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:22.790 align:start position:0%
would be what my interest is totally
um

02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:25.370 --> 02:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
having that outdoor option certainly can
 
02:23:28.490 --> 02:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
help keep cut costs down I think having
 
02:23:30.770 --> 02:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
the different tiers for the for the
 
02:23:34.010 --> 02:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
registration fees is totally uh
 
02:23:37.010 --> 02:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate and just so you know under
 
02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
the hemp program I have to track all of
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
my grows everything has to be sampled
 
02:23:47.150 --> 02:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
and I have to file annual reports with
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
the Farm Service Agency that is part of
 
02:23:53.030 --> 02:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
electronic database tracking all of my
 
02:23:56.570 --> 02:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
movements as a hemp producer and I don't
 
02:23:57.950 --> 02:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
know if the people studying this have
 
02:24:00.290 --> 02:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
looked at the existing USDA hemp program
 
02:24:03.770 --> 02:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
as a model for tracking production but I
 
02:24:07.250 --> 02:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
think it's it's accessible to any grower
 
02:24:12.349 --> 02:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
the chair will recognize
 
02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
is it Kate I'm sorry it's Kate that's
 
02:24:31.730 --> 02:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
fine hater Katie it's fine uh thank you
 
02:24:34.190 --> 02:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
all very much I will be very brief I do
 
02:24:36.110 --> 02:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
have written testimony for the committee
 
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Kate fry I'm the vice
 
02:24:41.270 --> 02:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
president of advocacy at new Futures new
 
02:24:43.309 --> 02:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
Futures works on health and wellness
 
02:24:43.319 --> 02:24:44.630 align:start position:0%
Futures works on health and wellness
policies

02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
policies
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
um uh with stakeholders prevention
 
02:24:48.650 --> 02:24:48.660 align:start position:0%
Partners to prevent and reduce alcohol
 
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
and drug problems in our state
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
um we realize that it is imperative to
 
02:24:55.130 --> 02:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
get cannabis commercialization policy
 
02:24:56.929 --> 02:24:56.939 align:start position:0%
right from the start
 
02:25:00.110 --> 02:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
um so optimal policy has to include uh
 
02:25:01.969 --> 02:25:01.979 align:start position:0%
best available scientific evidence and
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
reduce public harm so we have developed
 
02:25:07.730 --> 02:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
um principles that I will uh hand out to
 
02:25:09.889 --> 02:25:09.899 align:start position:0%
you in our testimony the principle
 
02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
however that is most aligned to the work
 
02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
today are the ways and means committee
 
02:25:15.710 --> 02:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
is ensuring appropriate funding for
 
02:25:18.050 --> 02:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
cannabis Revenue to be directed to
 
02:25:22.309 --> 02:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
reduce harms so we look at policy in
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
bills that apply revenue for substance
 
02:25:26.510 --> 02:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
misuse education prevention and
 
02:25:28.969 --> 02:25:28.979 align:start position:0%
treatment and recovery and also creating
 
02:25:31.250 --> 02:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
mass media and social media campaigns
 
02:25:34.130 --> 02:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
and the potential harms before the law
 
02:25:35.690 --> 02:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
is effective that's something we heard
 
02:25:38.690 --> 02:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
time and time again on the Cannabis
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
commission that I also served on so I
 
02:25:44.510 --> 02:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
will hand out to you a side by side of
 
02:25:46.969 --> 02:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
our principal with what's in the bill we
 
02:25:48.770 --> 02:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
are happy to see there there is a
 
02:25:50.809 --> 02:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
substance abuse Abuse Prevention and
 
02:25:52.309 --> 02:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
Recovery Fund
 
02:25:54.770 --> 02:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
um which funds shall be deposited into I
 
02:25:56.210 --> 02:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
think they are
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
um saying 10 percent of revenues however
 
02:26:00.830 --> 02:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
I guess I am concerned of how much that
 
02:26:04.010 --> 02:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
will really be based on the expenses
 
02:26:05.570 --> 02:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
um outlined in the bill by The Liquor
 
02:26:07.550 --> 02:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
Commission also
 
02:26:09.770 --> 02:26:09.780 align:start position:0%
um not having a great grasp on what the
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
revenue will bring forward however there
 
02:26:15.110 --> 02:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
is not anything in the bill that creates
 
02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
a mass
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
um media campaign prior to the bill
 
02:26:20.270 --> 02:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
being effective we understand the
 
02:26:23.809 --> 02:26:23.819 align:start position:0%
department is uh has an amendment to use
 
02:26:26.090 --> 02:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
revenue from the Dual light use license
 
02:26:26.100 --> 02:26:27.170 align:start position:0%
revenue from the Dual light use license
bill

02:26:27.170 --> 02:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
um portion of the bill in this in this
 
02:26:32.750 --> 02:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
bill we would support that amendment in
 
02:26:34.370 --> 02:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
order to give the revenue to the
 
02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
department to create the mass media
 
02:26:38.210 --> 02:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
campaign but again I don't think there's
 
02:26:39.770 --> 02:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
anything in there that would have it
 
02:26:41.630 --> 02:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
from the start and that's really
 
02:26:44.690 --> 02:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
important so before the law is effective
 
02:26:47.929 --> 02:26:47.939 align:start position:0%
we really have to have these policies in
 
02:26:50.030 --> 02:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
place so overall because it does not
 
02:26:52.309 --> 02:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
meet all of the principles we are still
 
02:26:55.250 --> 02:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
opposed to hb639 but we are happy to
 
02:26:57.410 --> 02:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
work with the committee on language and
 
02:26:59.630 --> 02:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
one thing that I will bring uh send to
 
02:27:01.730 --> 02:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
the committee is a recent report from
 
02:27:04.610 --> 02:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
the urban Institute on tax policies that
 
02:27:06.290 --> 02:27:06.300 align:start position:0%
give you the pros and cons of all tax
 
02:27:08.690 --> 02:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
policies and a couple Representatives
 
02:27:11.330 --> 02:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier about looking at the
 
02:27:11.340 --> 02:27:12.309 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier about looking at the
potency

02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
potency
 
02:27:14.809 --> 02:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
three taxes have moved in that direction
 
02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
of having a higher potency tax for
 
02:27:20.690 --> 02:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
higher potency product it's a way to
 
02:27:23.210 --> 02:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
reduce the use of high potency products
 
02:27:24.530 --> 02:27:24.540 align:start position:0%
which of course we are concerned about
 
02:27:29.630 --> 02:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
with the impact to kids but also if
 
02:27:31.969 --> 02:27:31.979 align:start position:0%
producers want to do that they can be
 
02:27:34.250 --> 02:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
taxed at a higher rate so I will send
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
this committee reports that report that
 
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you would you be open to questions
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
yes questions from the committee
 
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:53.630 --> 02:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
okay the chair I'm going to bring up the
 
02:27:56.030 --> 02:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
agency's last because we might end up
 
02:27:57.830 --> 02:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
with a work session on this and we'll
 
02:28:00.530 --> 02:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
probably have you come back for those
 
02:28:04.370 --> 02:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
um Matt Simon from primeatc are you here
 
02:28:08.809 --> 02:28:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:08.819 --> 02:28:14.469 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:28:14.469 --> 02:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:16.610 --> 02:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:28:18.290 --> 02:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members good to see
 
02:28:19.309 --> 02:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
you again
 
02:28:21.050 --> 02:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Matt Simon I
 
02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
live in Nashua I work for Prime ATC
 
02:28:25.849 --> 02:28:25.859 align:start position:0%
we're one of the three companies that's
 
02:28:29.210 --> 02:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
licensed to provide therapeutic cannabis
 
02:28:31.250 --> 02:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
to patients in New Hampshire
 
02:28:33.050 --> 02:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
there are currently about 14 000
 
02:28:35.030 --> 02:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
patients who are registered with the
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
02:28:39.710 --> 02:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
we operate two dispensaries one in
 
02:28:41.870 --> 02:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
Merrimack one in Chichester we have a
 
02:28:44.210 --> 02:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
cultivation and production facility in
 
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
Peterborough we are a non-profit and we
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
have about 55 employees
 
02:28:52.429 --> 02:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
so I was in the process last Friday of
 
02:28:54.469 --> 02:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
preparing written testimony and I saw my
 
02:28:56.270 --> 02:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
former colleague Karen O'Keefe from the
 
02:28:58.190 --> 02:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
marijuana policy project sent you about
 
02:29:00.650 --> 02:29:00.660 align:start position:0%
eight pages of detailed written
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
testimony much of which was exactly what
 
02:29:05.690 --> 02:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
I was going to write so I got lazy I'm
 
02:29:07.730 --> 02:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
going to defer and agree with much of
 
02:29:10.070 --> 02:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
what my former colleague I worked at the
 
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana policy project for 10 years
 
02:29:14.270 --> 02:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
and I agree with
 
02:29:17.809 --> 02:29:17.819 align:start position:0%
her perspectives generally
 
02:29:17.819 --> 02:29:18.770 align:start position:0%
her perspectives generally
um

02:29:18.770 --> 02:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:20.690 --> 02:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
so first of all we do support the bill
 
02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
although with somewhat less enthusiasm
 
02:29:25.370 --> 02:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
than before it was amended by the
 
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee I was a member of the
 
02:29:28.849 --> 02:29:28.859 align:start position:0%
Coalition that drafted the original bill
 
02:29:31.250 --> 02:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
which I believe was based on best
 
02:29:33.170 --> 02:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
practices observed from neighboring from
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
other States including neighboring
 
02:29:37.730 --> 02:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
states based on Lessons Learned learned
 
02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:38.929 align:start position:0%
states based on Lessons Learned learned
and

02:29:38.929 --> 02:29:38.939 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:40.370 --> 02:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
that's still true of much of the bill
 
02:29:43.550 --> 02:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
maybe not all of it so I'm
 
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
some of the things we're disappointed in
 
02:29:46.969 --> 02:29:46.979 align:start position:0%
are outside the scope of this committee
 
02:29:49.730 --> 02:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
home cultivation annulment Provisions so
 
02:29:52.969 --> 02:29:52.979 align:start position:0%
I won't elaborate on those focus on the
 
02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
things that you are concerned about
 
02:29:57.710 --> 02:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
primarily the tax structure so we've
 
02:29:58.969 --> 02:29:58.979 align:start position:0%
already had a lot of talk about the
 
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
proposed 15 percent cultivation tax I'm
 
02:30:05.330 --> 02:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
not an expert on tax policy I would be
 
02:30:06.830 --> 02:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
willing to go along with this if
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
somebody could explain it to me in a way
 
02:30:10.250 --> 02:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
that makes sense that it's actually
 
02:30:13.250 --> 02:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
workable particularly for the atcs and
 
02:30:14.750 --> 02:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
for other vertically integrated
 
02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:16.130 align:start position:0%
for other vertically integrated
businesses

02:30:16.130 --> 02:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
02:30:18.650 --> 02:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
so if we had a three-tier model it would
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
make sense there would be a transaction
 
02:30:22.670 --> 02:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
every time a cultivator sells to a
 
02:30:24.889 --> 02:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
manufacturer or a retailer and you just
 
02:30:27.290 --> 02:30:27.300 align:start position:0%
take 15 percent of that price that's
 
02:30:29.690 --> 02:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
easy well we're a vertically integrated
 
02:30:32.450 --> 02:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
business we would we be selling cannabis
 
02:30:34.969 --> 02:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
to ourselves and if so at what price
 
02:30:37.010 --> 02:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
would be be selling cannabis to
 
02:30:38.750 --> 02:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves if we could we would sell
 
02:30:40.429 --> 02:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis we would it seems like we'd be
 
02:30:42.170 --> 02:30:42.180 align:start position:0%
incentivized to sell it to ourselves at
 
02:30:46.010 --> 02:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
a penny a pound if if we were allowed so
 
02:30:47.450 --> 02:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
we'd have to come up with some kind of
 
02:30:51.110 --> 02:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
average and that's problematic in every
 
02:30:53.330 --> 02:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
way that I can think of uh first of all
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
there's no legal Market in no New
 
02:30:56.750 --> 02:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there wouldn't be
 
02:30:58.969 --> 02:30:58.979 align:start position:0%
transactions to base it on we'd have to
 
02:31:00.650 --> 02:31:00.660 align:start position:0%
look at other states if you look at
 
02:31:02.210 --> 02:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
prices in other states they vary
 
02:31:02.220 --> 02:31:03.950 align:start position:0%
prices in other states they vary
dramatically

02:31:03.950 --> 02:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
02:31:06.410 --> 02:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
in the early phase of these markets
 
02:31:08.510 --> 02:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
before they mature prices are extremely
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
high and then there is an inevitable
 
02:31:13.370 --> 02:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
point where the oversaturation point is
 
02:31:15.170 --> 02:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
reached where Supply catches up with
 
02:31:16.969 --> 02:31:16.979 align:start position:0%
demand and that's what's happening in
 
02:31:18.650 --> 02:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts right now the price of
 
02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
adult use cannabis in Massachusetts has
 
02:31:23.690 --> 02:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
reduced by more than half in the last
 
02:31:23.700 --> 02:31:24.590 align:start position:0%
reduced by more than half in the last
year

02:31:24.590 --> 02:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
so 15 of whatever it was a year ago
 
02:31:31.070 --> 02:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
would be half of that today by
 
02:31:34.010 --> 02:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts prices even if once we do
 
02:31:36.830 --> 02:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
have pricing that's predictable and
 
02:31:39.889 --> 02:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
established uh that doesn't solve the
 
02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
tremendous variability that exists
 
02:31:45.950 --> 02:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
between a pound of cannabis a versus a
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
pound of cannabis B it is an
 
02:31:50.389 --> 02:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
Agricultural Product freshness is
 
02:31:53.809 --> 02:31:53.819 align:start position:0%
incredibly important uh how well it has
 
02:31:57.050 --> 02:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
been trimmed and harvested and shucked
 
02:31:58.190 --> 02:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
and cured there are all sorts of
 
02:31:59.389 --> 02:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
shortcuts you can take in the
 
02:32:01.490 --> 02:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
cultivation process that result in a
 
02:32:04.070 --> 02:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
worse product so buyers are very
 
02:32:05.630 --> 02:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
interested in quality they want to
 
02:32:08.210 --> 02:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
inspect it and make sure that it will
 
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
this be able to sell at my retail store
 
02:32:12.050 --> 02:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
or will I be able to use this as a
 
02:32:14.990 --> 02:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer so we keep coming back to
 
02:32:17.690 --> 02:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
15 percent of what being being the
 
02:32:21.830 --> 02:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
question and I would love to understand
 
02:32:25.550 --> 02:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
how that that might work but I don't yet
 
02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:27.410 align:start position:0%
how that that might work but I don't yet
um

02:32:27.410 --> 02:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
the interstate commerce issue is also
 
02:32:31.610 --> 02:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
very sticky and that's already been
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
touched on I agree with Mr Gurion that
 
02:32:35.450 --> 02:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
it's very likely
 
02:32:37.370 --> 02:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
not that Congress will do anything
 
02:32:39.469 --> 02:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
because Congress is Congress but that
 
02:32:42.770 --> 02:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
courts a court will at some point uh
 
02:32:45.889 --> 02:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
rule as as indicated and strike down
 
02:32:49.250 --> 02:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce uh restrictions on
 
02:32:52.429 --> 02:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
the basis of the dormant Commerce Clause
 
02:32:55.490 --> 02:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
when that happens yes one option would
 
02:32:57.710 --> 02:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
be to extend the cultivation tax to to
 
02:32:57.720 --> 02:32:58.910 align:start position:0%
be to extend the cultivation tax to to
importers

02:32:58.910 --> 02:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
importers
 
02:33:00.950 --> 02:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
I do think it's an issue that needs to
 
02:33:03.530 --> 02:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
be addressed in this legislation rather
 
02:33:05.630 --> 02:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
than waiting down the road because if if
 
02:33:07.610 --> 02:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
a court rules and say
 
02:33:10.090 --> 02:33:10.100 align:start position:0%
March of next year that
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce is is no longer
 
02:33:15.770 --> 02:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
restricted uh the legislature doesn't
 
02:33:17.750 --> 02:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
reconvene until January you have to pass
 
02:33:19.070 --> 02:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
a bill through the through the whole
 
02:33:21.290 --> 02:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
process so if we have anticipated this
 
02:33:24.190 --> 02:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
in advance so that it doesn't require
 
02:33:26.450 --> 02:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
cannabis businesses in New Hampshire to
 
02:33:29.690 --> 02:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
wait eight months a year or more for the
 
02:33:31.429 --> 02:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
legislature to catch up and react to
 
02:33:32.929 --> 02:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
whatever the feds has done that would be
 
02:33:32.939 --> 02:33:34.730 align:start position:0%
whatever the feds has done that would be
wonderful

02:33:34.730 --> 02:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
02:33:37.550 --> 02:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
um incidentally a retail tax really does
 
02:33:39.230 --> 02:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
that because if you're just taking eight
 
02:33:40.730 --> 02:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
percent or whatever percent of the
 
02:33:43.010 --> 02:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
retail transactions then that insulates
 
02:33:44.389 --> 02:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
you against
 
02:33:47.389 --> 02:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
whatever might happen really anywhere uh
 
02:33:49.150 --> 02:33:49.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere else
 
02:33:52.070 --> 02:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
so one of the issues that didn't come up
 
02:33:55.630 --> 02:33:55.640 align:start position:0%
with that if you're a Manufacturing
 
02:33:57.830 --> 02:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
licensee in New Hampshire
 
02:34:01.790 --> 02:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh having the Cannabis you import or
 
02:34:04.250 --> 02:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
purchase to make edibles or whatever out
 
02:34:07.309 --> 02:34:07.319 align:start position:0%
of uh having that be subject to a 15 tax
 
02:34:10.370 --> 02:34:10.380 align:start position:0%
would be prohibitive uh consider that
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
these businesses in other states don't
 
02:34:14.809 --> 02:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
face that restriction if you make
 
02:34:16.490 --> 02:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
edibles in Vermont you don't have to pay
 
02:34:18.770 --> 02:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
a 15 tax on the Cannabis you buy to make
 
02:34:20.090 --> 02:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
edibles out of
 
02:34:22.849 --> 02:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
same in Massachusetts same well not in
 
02:34:24.410 --> 02:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
Maine actually Maine has a really
 
02:34:26.150 --> 02:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
complicated tax system as you've heard
 
02:34:28.490 --> 02:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
that you I would recommend you not adopt
 
02:34:31.250 --> 02:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
so I agree it should be very simple
 
02:34:33.050 --> 02:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
and if it could be very simple one-time
 
02:34:34.790 --> 02:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
tax at the cultivation level that'd be
 
02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:35.990 align:start position:0%
tax at the cultivation level that'd be
great

02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:34:37.790 --> 02:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
the really simple tax that make sense to
 
02:34:39.590 --> 02:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
me is applying it to every retail
 
02:34:41.210 --> 02:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
transaction and the other way that makes
 
02:34:43.610 --> 02:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
it really easy is for therapeutic
 
02:34:45.950 --> 02:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis program everybody has agreed
 
02:34:48.110 --> 02:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
throughout this process that therapeutic
 
02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis should remain untaxed in New
 
02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:51.530 align:start position:0%
cannabis should remain untaxed in New
Hampshire

02:34:51.530 --> 02:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:34:53.809 --> 02:34:53.819 align:start position:0%
that's really easy if
 
02:34:55.610 --> 02:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
somebody presents their card they're a
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
patient they they buy from you know
 
02:34:59.929 --> 02:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
there would be for the dispensaries they
 
02:35:02.270 --> 02:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
would have dual use so one cash register
 
02:35:03.889 --> 02:35:03.899 align:start position:0%
would be entirely therapeutic products
 
02:35:06.290 --> 02:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
that would be untaxed the bill also
 
02:35:09.170 --> 02:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
envisions adult use retailers that are
 
02:35:12.410 --> 02:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
not atcs down the road being able to get
 
02:35:14.150 --> 02:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
what's called a therapeutic cannabis
 
02:35:17.030 --> 02:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
endorsement and if we didn't do that we
 
02:35:18.590 --> 02:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
would not be expanding access to
 
02:35:20.389 --> 02:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
patients patients would only have seven
 
02:35:22.610 --> 02:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
places to buy cannabis in the state and
 
02:35:23.990 --> 02:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
we might have lots of adult use
 
02:35:26.150 --> 02:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
retailers so from a policy perspective I
 
02:35:28.090 --> 02:35:28.100 align:start position:0%
think it's important to increase
 
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
patient access
 
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure
 
02:35:37.130 --> 02:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
how an adult use business could exempt
 
02:35:39.950 --> 02:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
patients from taxation I see how an ATC
 
02:35:41.450 --> 02:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
could do it theoretically we would
 
02:35:43.010 --> 02:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
separate the Cannabis we grow into two
 
02:35:44.450 --> 02:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
streams one would get coded as
 
02:35:46.670 --> 02:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic and go into that system one
 
02:35:48.650 --> 02:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
would get coded as adult use go into
 
02:35:51.349 --> 02:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
that system we would charge ourselves 15
 
02:35:54.290 --> 02:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
percent of whatever mythical number
 
02:35:58.190 --> 02:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
comes up on the adult use side uh and
 
02:36:00.349 --> 02:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
not charge it on the other side but for
 
02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
an adult use retailer is envisioned by
 
02:36:03.770 --> 02:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
this bill I don't have any clue how they
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
could possibly be how patients could be
 
02:36:08.630 --> 02:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
Exempted from Taxation and I think it's
 
02:36:10.429 --> 02:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
very important that patients be Exempted
 
02:36:12.650 --> 02:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
for taxation for policy reasons that are
 
02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
outside the purview of this committee
 
02:36:18.230 --> 02:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
but pretty important I think
 
02:36:21.770 --> 02:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
final point the bill envisions dual use
 
02:36:24.349 --> 02:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
conversion fees for the atcs that's
 
02:36:26.030 --> 02:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
something we went along with it'd be
 
02:36:28.309 --> 02:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
about 100 up to a I think it's a hundred
 
02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for each
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
location that would be transitioning to
 
02:36:33.950 --> 02:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
dual use it's a lot of money
 
02:36:35.809 --> 02:36:35.819 align:start position:0%
we were on board with that because the
 
02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
original bill is drafted created a
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis Business Development Fund and a
 
02:36:43.490 --> 02:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
Justice reinvestment fund usually part
 
02:36:46.910 --> 02:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
of this conversation uh is understanding
 
02:36:48.410 --> 02:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
that we've had 70 plus years of
 
02:36:51.110 --> 02:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
Prohibition the countless lives and
 
02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
families have been ripped apart and
 
02:36:55.910 --> 02:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
people have been economically devastated
 
02:36:58.370 --> 02:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
in addition to having a freedom taken
 
02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
away and there's usually some attempt to
 
02:37:03.250 --> 02:37:03.260 align:start position:0%
make sure that small businesses
 
02:37:05.210 --> 02:37:05.220 align:start position:0%
communities have been impacted by
 
02:37:05.220 --> 02:37:06.230 align:start position:0%
communities have been impacted by
prohibition

02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
prohibition
 
02:37:09.410 --> 02:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity and to make money in
 
02:37:13.130 --> 02:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
in this this business and that isn't in
 
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
the current bill so leads me to ask why
 
02:37:17.389 --> 02:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
do we have those hundred thousand dollar
 
02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
fees we're much happier with those when
 
02:37:22.309 --> 02:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
they were going to an obvious good cause
 
02:37:26.510 --> 02:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
that we supported and now I would prefer
 
02:37:28.730 --> 02:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
to see them be eliminated or at least
 
02:37:30.530 --> 02:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
reduced or maybe
 
02:37:32.450 --> 02:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
use for something
 
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
that would be awesome
 
02:37:36.290 --> 02:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
it's a couple of quick clarifications
 
02:37:37.849 --> 02:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
from questions that have been asked I
 
02:37:39.950 --> 02:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
took a few notes so I did send you a
 
02:37:41.870 --> 02:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
chart with all of the tax rates from
 
02:37:43.250 --> 02:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
neighboring states you should have that
 
02:37:47.150 --> 02:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
in your inboxes it was misstated
 
02:37:49.730 --> 02:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
by a few previous speakers but really
 
02:37:51.469 --> 02:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
the neighboring states have an effective
 
02:37:54.469 --> 02:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
tax rate of around 20 percent each in
 
02:37:57.710 --> 02:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
Mass it's a 10.75 percent retail Tax
 
02:38:01.370 --> 02:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
Plus a 6.25 general sales tax
 
02:38:04.010 --> 02:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
and that gets you to 17 and then they
 
02:38:06.050 --> 02:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
have a three percent local option tax
 
02:38:08.389 --> 02:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
that gets it to 20 percent
 
02:38:13.849 --> 02:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
in Vermont it's uh 14 cannabis sales tax
 
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
six percent general sales tax 20 retail
 
02:38:20.330 --> 02:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
tax very straightforward
 
02:38:22.910 --> 02:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
Maine is much more complicated taxing
 
02:38:25.849 --> 02:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
flower trim immature plants and seeds
 
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
each at a different rate that's
 
02:38:28.969 --> 02:38:28.979 align:start position:0%
complicated for the reasons you've
 
02:38:33.170 --> 02:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:33.180 --> 02:38:37.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:38:37.730 --> 02:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:40.070 --> 02:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
quickly with regard to the quality of
 
02:38:41.630 --> 02:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
outdoor cannabis I think a lot of people
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
will want to grow outdoors in Vermont
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
there was a tremendous interest in small
 
02:38:49.429 --> 02:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
cultivator licenses being outdoors and
 
02:38:52.010 --> 02:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is not outdoor
 
02:38:54.469 --> 02:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
cannabis the problem with that was a
 
02:38:56.090 --> 02:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
failure of their independent lab testing
 
02:38:58.070 --> 02:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
system and that's why independent lab
 
02:39:00.290 --> 02:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
testing is the most important
 
02:39:02.690 --> 02:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
aspect of any regulated cannabis
 
02:39:02.700 --> 02:39:03.490 align:start position:0%
aspect of any regulated cannabis
business

02:39:03.490 --> 02:39:03.500 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:39:06.110 --> 02:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
this was a grower that had come online
 
02:39:08.389 --> 02:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
that was using a fungicide or at least
 
02:39:09.770 --> 02:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
was using a sprayer that still had
 
02:39:12.650 --> 02:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
residue from a fungicide probably a
 
02:39:14.090 --> 02:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
sprayer that had been used in the
 
02:39:15.710 --> 02:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
illicit market for many years but was
 
02:39:18.469 --> 02:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
now being used in the illicit market and
 
02:39:20.510 --> 02:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
that cannabis somehow actually got to
 
02:39:22.010 --> 02:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
the store shelves without being
 
02:39:24.230 --> 02:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
independently lab tested it was a big
 
02:39:27.710 --> 02:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
mess up from a inventory tracking seed
 
02:39:29.349 --> 02:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
to sail tracking
 
02:39:33.050 --> 02:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
scenario but it's not if this product
 
02:39:34.730 --> 02:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
had been tested it would have failed and
 
02:39:37.730 --> 02:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
it would not have been sold so as long
 
02:39:39.230 --> 02:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
weather cannabis has grown indoors or
 
02:39:41.389 --> 02:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
Outdoors there is a lot of risk of
 
02:39:41.399 --> 02:39:43.309 align:start position:0%
Outdoors there is a lot of risk of
contaminants

02:39:43.309 --> 02:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
contaminants
 
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis will never be misted as we
 
02:39:47.929 --> 02:39:47.939 align:start position:0%
heard earlier because that would cause
 
02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
it to develop mold once cannabis is is
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
dried and cured you do not want to add
 
02:39:56.030 --> 02:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
more moisture to it mold is something
 
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
you're always trying to
 
02:39:59.870 --> 02:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
to prevent but there's a risk of heavy
 
02:40:03.290 --> 02:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
metals pesticides mold and all sorts of
 
02:40:04.849 --> 02:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
things the only way to fix that is to
 
02:40:07.429 --> 02:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
have every product sold be tested and
 
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
I'm confident we can achieve that Within
 
02:40:12.050 --> 02:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
within the current bill
 
02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
so one last comment uh we've heard gummy
 
02:40:17.090 --> 02:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
bears mentioned a few times I just want
 
02:40:18.830 --> 02:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
to make it really clear there's no State
 
02:40:23.690 --> 02:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
selling gummy bears for cannabis uh we
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
the Fruit Chews we sell at Prime ATC are
 
02:40:29.630 --> 02:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
little squares they can't every state
 
02:40:31.490 --> 02:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
that I know of has rules that that
 
02:40:34.070 --> 02:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
prohibit these products being designed
 
02:40:35.330 --> 02:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
to resemble
 
02:40:38.270 --> 02:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh characters animals anything that
 
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
could be appealing to children and and
 
02:40:42.590 --> 02:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
often they have to have a cannabis leaf
 
02:40:44.150 --> 02:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
with an exclamation point or some other
 
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
symbol stamped right on them so no gummy
 
02:40:49.250 --> 02:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
bears worms cartoons or anything like
 
02:40:52.610 --> 02:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
that and I would be
 
02:40:54.290 --> 02:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
happy to conclude there and take any
 
02:40:55.790 --> 02:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
questions I'm guessing you'll have
 
02:40:58.610 --> 02:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
probably have them representative yes
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:41:01.670 --> 02:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
you suggest taxing Imports right now
 
02:41:06.770 --> 02:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
even though it's not a problem I thought
 
02:41:07.910 --> 02:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought I heard you say
 
02:41:10.190 --> 02:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
that it's going to come the interstate
 
02:41:12.410 --> 02:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
commerce so take care of it now
 
02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
and there's been a suggestion of
 
02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
applying that 15 tax to whatever comes
 
02:41:19.849 --> 02:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
into the state which could be retail as
 
02:41:21.410 --> 02:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
opposed to wholesale
 
02:41:23.210 --> 02:41:23.220 align:start position:0%
aren't we violating the interstate
 
02:41:25.010 --> 02:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
commerce clause that way unless we
 
02:41:27.830 --> 02:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
imputed a wholesale cost to the retail
 
02:41:27.840 --> 02:41:28.969 align:start position:0%
imputed a wholesale cost to the retail
product

02:41:28.969 --> 02:41:28.979 align:start position:0%
product
 
02:41:30.050 --> 02:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:41:32.330 --> 02:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative to clarify what I what I
 
02:41:34.010 --> 02:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
said or what I intended to say is that
 
02:41:36.110 --> 02:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
we should have a truck a tax structure
 
02:41:39.050 --> 02:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
that anticipates the eventuality of
 
02:41:42.770 --> 02:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce becoming legal in my
 
02:41:45.170 --> 02:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
in my opinion a retail tax would
 
02:41:47.030 --> 02:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
accomplish that because whether it came
 
02:41:49.490 --> 02:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
from California or you know halfway
 
02:41:51.469 --> 02:41:51.479 align:start position:0%
around the world for that matter if it's
 
02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
sold at a New Hampshire retailer it
 
02:41:57.349 --> 02:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
would be applied the tax uh
 
02:41:59.870 --> 02:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
adding importation to the cultivation
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
tax would be a different way of
 
02:42:03.590 --> 02:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
addressing that there would not be any
 
02:42:05.929 --> 02:42:05.939 align:start position:0%
actual importation
 
02:42:09.110 --> 02:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to get into the all of
 
02:42:10.790 --> 02:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
that legality but there would be no
 
02:42:13.550 --> 02:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
legal importation of cannabis until such
 
02:42:19.730 --> 02:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:19.740 --> 02:42:21.349 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:42:21.349 --> 02:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:42:23.570 --> 02:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
02:42:25.010 --> 02:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my questions
 
02:42:26.510 --> 02:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
you picked up on you said something
 
02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
something I picked up right away on and
 
02:42:31.849 --> 02:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
I I wondered if you could
 
02:42:34.010 --> 02:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
when I was reading this bill your model
 
02:42:36.170 --> 02:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
was specifically targeted and I say
 
02:42:38.150 --> 02:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
targeted because they're assessing you
 
02:42:40.309 --> 02:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
know assesses you know a hundred ten
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar application fee ninety
 
02:42:46.309 --> 02:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar uh licensing fee and so
 
02:42:49.849 --> 02:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
now you're in the you you you're out
 
02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
that money and then the bill goes on to
 
02:42:53.150 --> 02:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
continue to talk about other
 
02:42:54.889 --> 02:42:54.899 align:start position:0%
restrictions that your model might have
 
02:42:54.899 --> 02:42:55.790 align:start position:0%
restrictions that your model might have
to

02:42:55.790 --> 02:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:42:59.750 --> 02:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
comply with because you have a dual we'd
 
02:43:02.330 --> 02:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
have a dual purpose of that so
 
02:43:06.050 --> 02:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
this bill as enacted uh you know with
 
02:43:08.929 --> 02:43:08.939 align:start position:0%
with the fees and the taxes aside does
 
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
it put your model of a therapeutic model
 
02:43:13.790 --> 02:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
at a disadvantage
 
02:43:16.670 --> 02:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
if now we're opening up retail stores
 
02:43:18.170 --> 02:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
all over
 
02:43:20.750 --> 02:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question that's a
 
02:43:24.830 --> 02:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's the question exactly that we've
 
02:43:26.270 --> 02:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
been wrestling with for for the last
 
02:43:27.889 --> 02:43:27.899 align:start position:0%
last several months and particularly
 
02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
since the bill came came out of Commerce
 
02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:31.610 align:start position:0%
since the bill came came out of Commerce
so

02:43:31.610 --> 02:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:43:34.429 --> 02:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
as drafted first of all last year's bill
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
would have put state-run stores in
 
02:43:39.710 --> 02:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
direct competition with atc's tax there
 
02:43:41.510 --> 02:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
would be no taxes on the state-run
 
02:43:44.389 --> 02:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
stores and it certainly appeared to be
 
02:43:46.010 --> 02:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
set up to destroy the therapeutic
 
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis program last year's bill would
 
02:43:50.630 --> 02:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
not have allowed the atcs to transition
 
02:43:52.370 --> 02:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
to for-profit so it would have been
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
inviting every large out-of-state
 
02:43:57.290 --> 02:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
company into New Hampshire but telling
 
02:43:59.590 --> 02:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
the three companies that pioneered
 
02:44:01.849 --> 02:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
regulated cannabis in New Hampshire that
 
02:44:04.670 --> 02:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
know you have to stay non-profit so this
 
02:44:06.530 --> 02:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
bill's much better than last year's bill
 
02:44:08.870 --> 02:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
on that front it would allow the atcs to
 
02:44:10.550 --> 02:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
transition to for-profit so they could
 
02:44:12.410 --> 02:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
compete on an even playing field with
 
02:44:14.090 --> 02:44:14.100 align:start position:0%
the big companies that will inevitably
 
02:44:17.690 --> 02:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
be interested in this it also sets up a
 
02:44:19.370 --> 02:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
thoughtful transition for the
 
02:44:22.610 --> 02:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
02:44:25.010 --> 02:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
understanding that rules are going to be
 
02:44:27.050 --> 02:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
need to be updated the original bill
 
02:44:28.429 --> 02:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
would have had the Cannabis commission
 
02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately regulating both therapeutic
 
02:44:33.170 --> 02:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
cannabis and adult use cannabis that's
 
02:44:35.389 --> 02:44:35.399 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that I preferred that
 
02:44:37.670 --> 02:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
that system it's a little scary to think
 
02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
of having two different regulatory
 
02:44:41.330 --> 02:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
agencies that you have to answer to both
 
02:44:43.730 --> 02:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
of them and if this is going to work the
 
02:44:46.490 --> 02:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
rules have to be compatible between the
 
02:44:50.090 --> 02:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
two systems I think I think that the
 
02:44:51.710 --> 02:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
lawyer commission is not interested in
 
02:44:53.570 --> 02:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
regulating therapeutic cannabis program
 
02:44:55.790 --> 02:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
and I think DHHS is not interested in
 
02:44:57.770 --> 02:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
having the Liquor Commission do that so
 
02:45:00.050 --> 02:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
instead of figuring out how to get it
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
all under one
 
02:45:03.950 --> 02:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
one system it will be a process of
 
02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
figuring out how to make how to maintain
 
02:45:07.370 --> 02:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
the viability of the therapeutic
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis program while rolling out adult
 
02:45:11.929 --> 02:45:11.939 align:start position:0%
use cannabis there's going to be a lot
 
02:45:13.910 --> 02:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
of moving parts
 
02:45:15.770 --> 02:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
we were on board with those fees
 
02:45:18.170 --> 02:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
initially because we understood the
 
02:45:20.450 --> 02:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
dynamic and we see how this has gone in
 
02:45:22.670 --> 02:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
other states there's often an interest
 
02:45:25.809 --> 02:45:25.819 align:start position:0%
in helping to small businesses succeed
 
02:45:29.389 --> 02:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
in this and the companies that have gone
 
02:45:32.030 --> 02:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
first are expected to have
 
02:45:34.670 --> 02:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
you know a first mover advantage and
 
02:45:36.710 --> 02:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
it's normal to have fees to support this
 
02:45:38.690 --> 02:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
kind of program because how else will
 
02:45:40.550 --> 02:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
there be startup money to help small
 
02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:41.870 align:start position:0%
there be startup money to help small
businesses

02:45:41.870 --> 02:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
02:45:43.250 --> 02:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this bill about
 
02:45:45.830 --> 02:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
helping small businesses uh you know I
 
02:45:47.570 --> 02:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
think the Liquor Commission could choose
 
02:45:50.630 --> 02:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
to to write rules that make it easy and
 
02:45:52.190 --> 02:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
favorable for small businesses or they
 
02:45:54.530 --> 02:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
might not we heard chairman hunt say
 
02:45:56.990 --> 02:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
earlier that the cultivators will be the
 
02:45:59.630 --> 02:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
smallest number of licenses that's not
 
02:46:01.190 --> 02:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
the way it is in a lot of other states
 
02:46:02.450 --> 02:46:02.460 align:start position:0%
in Vermont there are far more
 
02:46:05.270 --> 02:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
cultivators than retailers
 
02:46:07.849 --> 02:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
um but I think what we want is for
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
businesses to have the flexibility to do
 
02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:10.370 align:start position:0%
businesses to have the flexibility to do
it

02:46:10.370 --> 02:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:46:11.990 --> 02:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
do what they want to do if you want to
 
02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
be vertically integrated
 
02:46:15.889 --> 02:46:15.899 align:start position:0%
that needs to be possible if you want to
 
02:46:17.750 --> 02:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
specialize in one aspect of it that
 
02:46:19.370 --> 02:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
needs to be possible if you want to
 
02:46:21.410 --> 02:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
specialize in serving patients that
 
02:46:23.030 --> 02:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be possible
 
02:46:25.250 --> 02:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
I think all that intention is in the
 
02:46:28.370 --> 02:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
bill but an awful lot is left to to rule
 
02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
making and regulations
 
02:46:33.469 --> 02:46:33.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you madam chair just to
 
02:46:35.809 --> 02:46:35.819 align:start position:0%
follow up on that and because the last
 
02:46:37.490 --> 02:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
thing you said really I think is what we
 
02:46:40.370 --> 02:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
have to is a big unknown is the rules
 
02:46:42.950 --> 02:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
what we do know is for someone like you
 
02:46:45.950 --> 02:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
to transition into retail we know you're
 
02:46:47.389 --> 02:46:47.399 align:start position:0%
going to have to come up with a hundred
 
02:46:49.309 --> 02:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars we don't know what that
 
02:46:51.410 --> 02:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
will be what the rules will be for the
 
02:46:53.630 --> 02:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
fees for somebody if I wanted to open it
 
02:46:55.130 --> 02:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
up in an abandoned Pizza Hut you know
 
02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
and sell sell marijuana what that would
 
02:46:58.250 --> 02:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
be maybe it's five thousand dollars
 
02:47:00.410 --> 02:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
maybe it's two thousand dollars but what
 
02:47:02.990 --> 02:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
we do know here it sounds like
 
02:47:04.849 --> 02:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
well I understand this right
 
02:47:07.030 --> 02:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
and let me know if I'm something wrong
 
02:47:09.950 --> 02:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
these fees you're actually subsidizing
 
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
the state to get their program running
 
02:47:15.469 --> 02:47:15.479 align:start position:0%
and putting you at a possible
 
02:47:15.479 --> 02:47:16.910 align:start position:0%
and putting you at a possible
disadvantage

02:47:16.910 --> 02:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
02:47:19.969 --> 02:47:19.979 align:start position:0%
to some unknown versus unknown fees that
 
02:47:22.130 --> 02:47:22.140 align:start position:0%
haven't even been defined yet do I
 
02:47:23.929 --> 02:47:23.939 align:start position:0%
summarize that properly yeah I think
 
02:47:25.730 --> 02:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely right I mean Most
 
02:47:29.630 --> 02:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
states have seen fit to write fees uh in
 
02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:30.770 align:start position:0%
states have seen fit to write fees uh in
into

02:47:30.770 --> 02:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:47:33.530 --> 02:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
into the legislation in some way usually
 
02:47:36.170 --> 02:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
the priority being to to favor smaller
 
02:47:38.570 --> 02:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
tiers and make sure the fees will be low
 
02:47:40.490 --> 02:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
especially for small small-scale
 
02:47:42.710 --> 02:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
cultivators the decision was made in the
 
02:47:44.750 --> 02:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
last committee to not do that and and to
 
02:47:47.030 --> 02:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
leave it to to a commission so now we
 
02:47:48.410 --> 02:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
have no idea what those fees might be
 
02:47:50.590 --> 02:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
relative to a hundred thousand dollars
 
02:47:53.870 --> 02:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
should a big company uh I'm not going to
 
02:47:55.610 --> 02:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
name any big companies but there there
 
02:47:57.110 --> 02:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
are a lot of them out there and they're
 
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
not some of them have reputations of not
 
02:48:03.130 --> 02:48:03.140 align:start position:0%
being particularly ethical and should we
 
02:48:06.530 --> 02:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
I it could be a playing field that is
 
02:48:08.030 --> 02:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
slanted toward them depending on how the
 
02:48:10.250 --> 02:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
rules are written
 
02:48:12.530 --> 02:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Schoenberg
 
02:48:14.750 --> 02:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:48:16.309 --> 02:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
02:48:17.990 --> 02:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
since you mentioned cultivators again
 
02:48:20.210 --> 02:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
I'm back on the tax that wants to be
 
02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:23.330 align:start position:0%
I'm back on the tax that wants to be
applied

02:48:23.330 --> 02:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:26.090 --> 02:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
since the proposed tax is going to be
 
02:48:29.090 --> 02:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
applied at the cultivator level
 
02:48:31.969 --> 02:48:31.979 align:start position:0%
are these cultivators are they
 
02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
going to be strictly domestic or can
 
02:48:36.590 --> 02:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
they be a subsidiary of a multinational
 
02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:38.750 align:start position:0%
they be a subsidiary of a multinational
organization

02:48:38.750 --> 02:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
organization
 
02:48:40.250 --> 02:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
that would
 
02:48:42.889 --> 02:48:42.899 align:start position:0%
come in and set them up
 
02:48:44.929 --> 02:48:44.939 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
look at different ways to reduce their
 
02:48:51.349 --> 02:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
tax obligation at the end of the process
 
02:48:51.359 --> 02:48:52.550 align:start position:0%
tax obligation at the end of the process
yeah

02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:48:55.130 --> 02:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so I I wanted
 
02:48:57.050 --> 02:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
to give it or I think yeah I haven't
 
02:48:59.150 --> 02:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
looked at this section of the bill in a
 
02:49:01.550 --> 02:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
while there is a residency
 
02:49:04.370 --> 02:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
requirement uh
 
02:49:07.309 --> 02:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
and so you you will at least have to to
 
02:49:09.349 --> 02:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
have a presence in New Hampshire if you
 
02:49:11.510 --> 02:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
are a large out-of-state or
 
02:49:13.969 --> 02:49:13.979 align:start position:0%
multinational corporation one of the
 
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
issues as as others have pointed out is
 
02:49:18.290 --> 02:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
the courts have gotten into the habit of
 
02:49:19.790 --> 02:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
striking those down
 
02:49:21.889 --> 02:49:21.899 align:start position:0%
on the basis of violating the interstate
 
02:49:25.370 --> 02:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
commerce clause that if it's okay for a
 
02:49:27.050 --> 02:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire person to start a business
 
02:49:28.969 --> 02:49:28.979 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire why is it not okay for
 
02:49:31.250 --> 02:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
a Massachusetts resident to start in New
 
02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's part of why we
 
02:49:35.929 --> 02:49:35.939 align:start position:0%
think that the whole interstate commerce
 
02:49:41.809 --> 02:49:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:43.670 --> 02:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative Wheatley
 
02:49:46.190 --> 02:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:49:47.990 --> 02:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
going back to your
 
02:49:49.849 --> 02:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
to the beginning of your
 
02:49:54.770 --> 02:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
testimony the 15 of what can you tell me
 
02:49:58.670 --> 02:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
sure yeah we we sell a wide range of
 
02:50:05.090 --> 02:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
cannabis and cannabis products I direct
 
02:50:06.830 --> 02:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
you to our menu but our website's down
 
02:50:09.050 --> 02:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
actually this morning I was I had to
 
02:50:10.790 --> 02:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
send an email back there to
 
02:50:15.110 --> 02:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
notify people about that but um yeah we
 
02:50:18.410 --> 02:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
we grow all of our cannabis flour some
 
02:50:20.929 --> 02:50:20.939 align:start position:0%
of that is sold as flour some of it is
 
02:50:20.939 --> 02:50:22.849 align:start position:0%
of that is sold as flour some of it is
uh

02:50:22.849 --> 02:50:22.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:50:25.610 --> 02:50:25.620 align:start position:0%
we have Edibles ranging from Fruit Chews
 
02:50:28.670 --> 02:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
to various chocolate products
 
02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:29.450 align:start position:0%
to various chocolate products
um

02:50:29.450 --> 02:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:31.610 --> 02:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
we have Vape cartridges
 
02:50:31.620 --> 02:50:33.889 align:start position:0%
we have Vape cartridges
concentrates

02:50:33.889 --> 02:50:33.899 align:start position:0%
concentrates
 
02:50:36.349 --> 02:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
we even sell suppositories
 
02:50:39.830 --> 02:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
so basically anything that could benefit
 
02:50:41.929 --> 02:50:41.939 align:start position:0%
a patient we sell capsules as well
 
02:50:44.750 --> 02:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
tinctures I think I've hit all the
 
02:50:46.309 --> 02:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
categories now but really it's a wide
 
02:50:49.010 --> 02:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
range of products and uh and we have to
 
02:50:51.050 --> 02:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
make them all ourselves can I have a
 
02:50:53.210 --> 02:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
02:50:53.220 --> 02:50:54.830 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
um so

02:50:54.830 --> 02:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:50:57.650 --> 02:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
about the revenue generation it seems
 
02:51:01.190 --> 02:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
very unclear to you uh what
 
02:51:05.330 --> 02:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
you cultivate what that really uh how to
 
02:51:07.429 --> 02:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
break down the value of that within your
 
02:51:09.650 --> 02:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
business model but I'm assuming that
 
02:51:11.870 --> 02:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
everything you sell on the retail level
 
02:51:13.550 --> 02:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
has a price
 
02:51:16.490 --> 02:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
and that it would be pretty easy to
 
02:51:20.030 --> 02:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
apply uh tax to each of those products
 
02:51:22.670 --> 02:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
you know whether it be 15 or something
 
02:51:25.309 --> 02:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
else is that correct
 
02:51:27.050 --> 02:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so I think like most
 
02:51:30.110 --> 02:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
businesses we we learn what customers in
 
02:51:32.090 --> 02:51:32.100 align:start position:0%
our case patients are willing to pay for
 
02:51:34.429 --> 02:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
prices by putting it on the Shelf
 
02:51:36.050 --> 02:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
putting it on the menu telling them it's
 
02:51:37.969 --> 02:51:37.979 align:start position:0%
available if it sells at that price
 
02:51:39.889 --> 02:51:39.899 align:start position:0%
that's that's the price if it doesn't
 
02:51:41.570 --> 02:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
sell maybe we need to reduce the price
 
02:51:44.990 --> 02:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
we also have very limited wholesaling so
 
02:51:47.270 --> 02:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
atcs can sell flour to each other can
 
02:51:49.790 --> 02:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
sell products to each other so sometimes
 
02:51:52.130 --> 02:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
you know we we will bundle up some flour
 
02:51:54.349 --> 02:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
and offer it to another ATC for sale and
 
02:51:55.969 --> 02:51:55.979 align:start position:0%
maybe they bought it from us at a price
 
02:51:57.830 --> 02:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
last time maybe they don't want to buy
 
02:52:01.010 --> 02:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
it this time it's buyers and sellers
 
02:52:03.950 --> 02:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
create prices by making transactions in
 
02:52:05.870 --> 02:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
a Marketplace and that's our concern
 
02:52:08.330 --> 02:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
here like these seem like they would be
 
02:52:10.670 --> 02:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
imaginary transactions and therefore
 
02:52:13.250 --> 02:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
who's who's going to decide uh it either
 
02:52:14.630 --> 02:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
02:52:17.150 --> 02:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
you know have to be some some Arbiter of
 
02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
what is an acceptable tax rate for this
 
02:52:22.910 --> 02:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
given batch of of cannabis
 
02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like the only
 
02:52:29.510 --> 02:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
Market that you can see results of
 
02:52:32.150 --> 02:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
really is the retail Market
 
02:52:34.910 --> 02:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
correct correct thank you
 
02:52:37.190 --> 02:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis thank you madam
 
02:52:39.530 --> 02:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
chair this is like a follow-up to to
 
02:52:42.830 --> 02:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
what we've been talking about so so we
 
02:52:44.690 --> 02:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
know you have these different kinds of
 
02:52:49.010 --> 02:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
products and I'm interested in the
 
02:52:52.630 --> 02:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
possibility of charging
 
02:52:56.150 --> 02:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
taxing at a higher rate the ones with
 
02:52:59.690 --> 02:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
the higher level of THC so I'm just
 
02:53:02.570 --> 02:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can talk about the
 
02:53:05.510 --> 02:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
feasibility of doing that I you and I
 
02:53:07.130 --> 02:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
also I don't understand like the
 
02:53:07.140 --> 02:53:08.450 align:start position:0%
also I don't understand like the
comparability

02:53:08.450 --> 02:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
comparability
 
02:53:13.010 --> 02:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
of you know just the plain cannabis and
 
02:53:16.090 --> 02:53:16.100 align:start position:0%
when it turns into a gummy or you know
 
02:53:19.490 --> 02:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
those are all different can tell me how
 
02:53:20.990 --> 02:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
how that would work if that's what we
 
02:53:22.849 --> 02:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
02:53:24.889 --> 02:53:24.899 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I've heard
 
02:53:27.469 --> 02:53:27.479 align:start position:0%
that idea suggested I'm not aware of any
 
02:53:29.870 --> 02:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
state that has actually adopted that in
 
02:53:31.910 --> 02:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
part because I don't know how it would
 
02:53:33.650 --> 02:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
work uh
 
02:53:36.170 --> 02:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
it it seems
 
02:53:38.269 --> 02:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
it seems like a recipe for a lot of
 
02:53:41.450 --> 02:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
confusion and you know like first of all
 
02:53:44.769 --> 02:53:44.779 align:start position:0%
inhalable products are potency is
 
02:53:46.849 --> 02:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
measured and thought about differently
 
02:53:49.070 --> 02:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
for any product that will be inhaled
 
02:53:51.710 --> 02:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
versus any edible
 
02:53:54.110 --> 02:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
product with edible products you're
 
02:53:56.450 --> 02:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
talking about milligrams of THC usually
 
02:53:58.670 --> 02:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
being being the
 
02:54:00.590 --> 02:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
the thing that matters and for inhalable
 
02:54:01.910 --> 02:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
products you're talking about a
 
02:54:01.920 --> 02:54:03.710 align:start position:0%
products you're talking about a
percentage

02:54:03.710 --> 02:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
02:54:06.110 --> 02:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
a THC percentage
 
02:54:08.990 --> 02:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
within the product so it's it's at least
 
02:54:12.590 --> 02:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh theoretically possible but I don't
 
02:54:14.630 --> 02:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
think it's theoretically even possible
 
02:54:18.769 --> 02:54:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:18.779 --> 02:54:20.269 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

02:54:20.269 --> 02:54:20.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:54:23.030 --> 02:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
um I just want to ask you about there
 
02:54:25.849 --> 02:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
was a study commission and they didn't
 
02:54:28.490 --> 02:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
they made an estimate on revenue and one
 
02:54:30.889 --> 02:54:30.899 align:start position:0%
of the factors that they used is they
 
02:54:33.650 --> 02:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
made an assumption that this is just
 
02:54:36.250 --> 02:54:36.260 align:start position:0%
talking about regular just cannabis
 
02:54:40.070 --> 02:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
that that the average
 
02:54:40.080 --> 02:54:43.070 align:start position:0%
that that the average
user

02:54:43.070 --> 02:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
user
 
02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:43.990 align:start position:0%
user
um

02:54:43.990 --> 02:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:46.309 --> 02:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
consumed in a year
 
02:54:50.269 --> 02:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
between five and eight ounces does that
 
02:54:52.730 --> 02:54:52.740 align:start position:0%
sound does that
 
02:54:57.050 --> 02:54:57.060 align:start position:0%
comport with your experience or what I
 
02:54:58.790 --> 02:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
mean there have been a number of studies
 
02:55:01.010 --> 02:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
over the years trying to quantify that
 
02:55:02.510 --> 02:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
as with
 
02:55:05.450 --> 02:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
other averages and with regard to
 
02:55:08.450 --> 02:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
cannabis and it's really hard to talk
 
02:55:10.969 --> 02:55:10.979 align:start position:0%
about averages because there will be a
 
02:55:12.469 --> 02:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
small percentage of consumers who
 
02:55:15.230 --> 02:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
consume quite a lot of cannabis and then
 
02:55:17.330 --> 02:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
there will be a larger population of
 
02:55:19.370 --> 02:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
folks who you know maybe take a puff
 
02:55:21.349 --> 02:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
every once in a while or take an edible
 
02:55:22.910 --> 02:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
every once in a while when they want to
 
02:55:24.469 --> 02:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
get a good night's sleep and use it very
 
02:55:26.570 --> 02:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
occasionally so
 
02:55:28.490 --> 02:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
you know there are different categories
 
02:55:30.050 --> 02:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
of users and different rates of
 
02:55:31.610 --> 02:55:31.620 align:start position:0%
consumption much as there are with
 
02:55:34.309 --> 02:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
alcohol or tobacco and it's it's hard to
 
02:55:36.710 --> 02:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
speak with a broad brush about about the
 
02:55:42.230 --> 02:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:44.330 --> 02:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
offhand I don't know I will say that
 
02:55:46.309 --> 02:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
study commission was was several years
 
02:55:49.010 --> 02:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
ago there are probably better Market
 
02:55:51.050 --> 02:55:51.060 align:start position:0%
estimates I know there are better Market
 
02:55:53.630 --> 02:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
estimates available uh Vermont just
 
02:55:56.450 --> 02:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
rolled out its adult use market and they
 
02:55:59.290 --> 02:55:59.300 align:start position:0%
did a really terrific market analysis
 
02:56:01.309 --> 02:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
that's available from the Vermont
 
02:56:04.490 --> 02:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
cannabis Control Board website they
 
02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
02:56:07.250 --> 02:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
you know they hired an economist and
 
02:56:09.469 --> 02:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
they looked at you know how much do we
 
02:56:11.150 --> 02:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
think people consume who live in Vermont
 
02:56:13.730 --> 02:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
how much do we think people consume who
 
02:56:15.410 --> 02:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
are tourists who visit Vermont or who
 
02:56:17.210 --> 02:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
pass through Vermont or who live in a
 
02:56:19.250 --> 02:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
state like guess what New Hampshire that
 
02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
still does not have retail cannabis how
 
02:56:23.330 --> 02:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
many grandstanders for example are going
 
02:56:25.849 --> 02:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
to go so they did a really detailed
 
02:56:28.370 --> 02:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
deep dive there and I think those are
 
02:56:29.690 --> 02:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
probably going to be better estimates
 
02:56:31.610 --> 02:56:31.620 align:start position:0%
than than anything that was in our
 
02:56:33.769 --> 02:56:33.779 align:start position:0%
commission report a few years ago
 
02:56:36.349 --> 02:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
representative ulery
 
02:56:38.210 --> 02:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Sharon it looks like
 
02:56:40.490 --> 02:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
this would be the last question
 
02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:41.090 align:start position:0%
this would be the last question
um

02:56:41.090 --> 02:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:43.870 --> 02:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
regarding the
 
02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
multinationals that was brought up
 
02:56:47.929 --> 02:56:47.939 align:start position:0%
earlier now are you referring to a
 
02:56:49.910 --> 02:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
multinational would manual that grows it
 
02:56:53.090 --> 02:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
out of uh bicep the plot grows the stuff
 
02:56:55.309 --> 02:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
and sells it or are you talking about a
 
02:56:57.550 --> 02:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
multinational like
 
02:57:03.349 --> 02:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
Monsanto or DeKalb that produces seeds
 
02:57:04.849 --> 02:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I'm talking
 
02:57:08.630 --> 02:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
about cannabis companies that may have
 
02:57:10.070 --> 02:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
started in the U.S or may have started
 
02:57:11.570 --> 02:57:11.580 align:start position:0%
in Canada or may have started somewhere
 
02:57:13.849 --> 02:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
else but that have grown aggressively
 
02:57:15.769 --> 02:57:15.779 align:start position:0%
and participate in all aspects of the
 
02:57:18.370 --> 02:57:18.380 align:start position:0%
Cannabis industry from growing
 
02:57:21.950 --> 02:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and retailing and you know
 
02:57:24.830 --> 02:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
in in my last job I was trying to pass
 
02:57:27.050 --> 02:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
legalization laws and often these these
 
02:57:28.429 --> 02:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
companies would send their own lobbyists
 
02:57:29.570 --> 02:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
and they were trying to pass very
 
02:57:30.950 --> 02:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
different laws than the ones that I was
 
02:57:32.510 --> 02:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
trying to pass they wanted very high
 
02:57:35.990 --> 02:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
barriers to entry massive fees keep home
 
02:57:38.809 --> 02:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
grow legal let's only have a few big
 
02:57:43.550 --> 02:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:48.050 --> 02:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that the the straw
 
02:57:50.630 --> 02:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
person multinational
 
02:57:52.730 --> 02:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
does anything it can to make money on
 
02:57:55.190 --> 02:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
this product yes I am saying that thank
 
02:57:55.200 --> 02:57:57.950 align:start position:0%
this product yes I am saying that thank
you

02:57:57.950 --> 02:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:01.010 --> 02:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
representative thank you just quickly
 
02:58:05.450 --> 02:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
you said you sent us all on a chart of
 
02:58:08.570 --> 02:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
all the taxes and and that are added on
 
02:58:12.349 --> 02:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
in our region and it hasn't come yet
 
02:58:14.450 --> 02:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I sent it to the Ways and
 
02:58:16.130 --> 02:58:16.140 align:start position:0%
Means Committee address while I was
 
02:58:18.769 --> 02:58:18.779 align:start position:0%
sitting back there so maybe uh it's not
 
02:58:20.570 --> 02:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
maybe you got stuck in a spam folder or
 
02:58:22.370 --> 02:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
something I know that happened in the
 
02:58:23.990 --> 02:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
last committee
 
02:58:26.330 --> 02:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
if you'd be comfortable uh there's also
 
02:58:29.210 --> 02:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
an online testimony portal and that
 
02:58:31.429 --> 02:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
really we make sure we see that so if
 
02:58:33.889 --> 02:58:33.899 align:start position:0%
you could do that as well
 
02:58:36.530 --> 02:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
oh it isn't spam so thank you there's
 
02:58:38.269 --> 02:58:38.279 align:start position:0%
two ways to get us that the email
 
02:58:40.550 --> 02:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
address and the online portal so thank
 
02:58:43.370 --> 02:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
you very much any other questions
 
02:58:46.670 --> 02:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
great thank you so much and just it's it
 
02:58:48.650 --> 02:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
obviously we're trying to cram a lot of
 
02:58:51.410 --> 02:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
information in here we've got uh two
 
02:58:53.630 --> 02:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
more quick people testifying and then
 
02:58:56.809 --> 02:58:56.819 align:start position:0%
what I think we should do is uh end the

welcome

02:59:27.530 --> 02:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
02:59:29.330 --> 02:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
02:59:31.730 --> 02:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
still uh thank you madam chairman and
 
02:59:32.809 --> 02:59:32.819 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:59:35.870 --> 02:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
Joseph Hannan I was a public member of
 
02:59:37.790 --> 02:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis study commission that you
 
02:59:40.630 --> 02:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
heard about earlier back in 2018
 
02:59:43.130 --> 02:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
I'm in support of this bill I do have a
 
02:59:44.389 --> 02:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
few things that I'd like to address
 
02:59:47.750 --> 02:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
about the taxation aspects of it you've
 
02:59:48.950 --> 02:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of people already talk about
 
02:59:51.170 --> 02:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
the rooms of meals tax and a retail
 
02:59:52.670 --> 02:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
level sales tax I definitely support
 
02:59:55.670 --> 02:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
that strongly even though our commission
 
02:59:57.410 --> 02:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
years ago thought that a wholesale tax
 
02:59:58.969 --> 02:59:58.979 align:start position:0%
would be a good idea there have been a
 
03:00:00.349 --> 03:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
lot of states that have legalized since
 
03:00:01.790 --> 03:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
and we've seen what has actually
 
03:00:04.750 --> 03:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
happened with some of those taxation
 
03:00:07.910 --> 03:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
agendas in other states
 
03:00:09.650 --> 03:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
um you know where the revenue goes is
 
03:00:12.170 --> 03:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
important uh the ease of how the taxes
 
03:00:13.550 --> 03:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
are collected and who collects them are
 
03:00:14.990 --> 03:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
important but the primary concern we
 
03:00:16.670 --> 03:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
should be thinking about is the
 
03:00:19.130 --> 03:00:19.140 align:start position:0%
sustainability of the businesses and the
 
03:00:20.750 --> 03:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
ability to serve the consumers that
 
03:00:22.130 --> 03:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
they're providing to
 
03:00:24.410 --> 03:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
so you know the primary thing we need to
 
03:00:25.849 --> 03:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
do is make sure that these businesses
 
03:00:27.290 --> 03:00:27.300 align:start position:0%
don't go out of business because what's
 
03:00:29.929 --> 03:00:29.939 align:start position:0%
the purpose of having a tax system if
 
03:00:32.330 --> 03:00:32.340 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be around
 
03:00:32.340 --> 03:00:33.050 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be around
um

03:00:33.050 --> 03:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:34.550 --> 03:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know we're in a state with higher
 
03:00:36.710 --> 03:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
energy costs colder drier climate most
 
03:00:39.429 --> 03:00:39.439 align:start position:0%
of the year we have a smaller consumer
 
03:00:43.730 --> 03:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
base than most States and cultivation is
 
03:00:46.130 --> 03:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
very difficult we've heard outdoor and
 
03:00:48.110 --> 03:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
even indoor is very expensive
 
03:00:50.690 --> 03:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
uh import taxes would not be legal once
 
03:00:53.210 --> 03:00:53.220 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce is is going on we
 
03:00:54.410 --> 03:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
don't have border checkpoints in New
 
03:00:55.429 --> 03:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire even though some people think
 
03:00:56.630 --> 03:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
it may be a good idea with our Southern
 
03:00:59.030 --> 03:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
border we don't have that
 
03:00:59.040 --> 03:00:59.750 align:start position:0%
border we don't have that
um

03:00:59.750 --> 03:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:01.969 --> 03:01:01.979 align:start position:0%
you know another thing is uh we heard
 
03:01:03.889 --> 03:01:03.899 align:start position:0%
about cultivation taxes being applied to
 
03:01:05.269 --> 03:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
hemp because the seeds are considered
 
03:01:07.309 --> 03:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis according to this bill uh hemp
 
03:01:08.870 --> 03:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
products are are legally able to be
 
03:01:10.010 --> 03:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
grown in New Hampshire and other states
 
03:01:12.650 --> 03:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
and their uses are much greater than
 
03:01:15.110 --> 03:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
just consuming uh they can be used as
 
03:01:19.370 --> 03:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
food uh fuel textiles uh you know
 
03:01:21.230 --> 03:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
Fabrics ropes you name it there's a
 
03:01:22.670 --> 03:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
whole host of things that hemp products
 
03:01:23.929 --> 03:01:23.939 align:start position:0%
could be used for so we don't want to
 
03:01:28.429 --> 03:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
get that stuck in the taxation scheme
 
03:01:30.230 --> 03:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
um you know that we also heard about
 
03:01:32.690 --> 03:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
charging by weight and if you have
 
03:01:34.250 --> 03:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
um the weight of a product is the
 
03:01:37.670 --> 03:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
primary mode of Taxation the goal of the
 
03:01:38.990 --> 03:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
people growing it and selling it is
 
03:01:40.730 --> 03:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
going to be get the most bang for your
 
03:01:42.469 --> 03:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
buck you're going to make the strongest
 
03:01:44.510 --> 03:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
most highest concentrated THC product
 
03:01:47.210 --> 03:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
you can so you're paying less of a tax
 
03:01:49.550 --> 03:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
per weight uh we don't have that with
 
03:01:51.050 --> 03:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
beer and wine because there are limits
 
03:01:52.490 --> 03:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
on how much alcohol is allowed in beer
 
03:01:53.870 --> 03:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
and wine so unless you have a very
 
03:01:55.730 --> 03:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
tiered system of you know 10 to 15
 
03:01:59.809 --> 03:01:59.819 align:start position:0%
percent 15 to 30 30 to 60 80 percent and
 
03:02:01.670 --> 03:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
different tax rates for each amount of
 
03:02:03.950 --> 03:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
strength of THC in a product it's going
 
03:02:05.389 --> 03:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
to be almost impossible to do it by
 
03:02:07.969 --> 03:02:07.979 align:start position:0%
weight unless your goal is to just make
 
03:02:09.889 --> 03:02:09.899 align:start position:0%
it incentivize for stronger products
 
03:02:11.030 --> 03:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
we've seen that in the illegal Market
 
03:02:13.550 --> 03:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
with things like fentanyl if we tax the
 
03:02:15.650 --> 03:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
illicit Market of Fentanyl and heroin
 
03:02:17.809 --> 03:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
like we were planning to do when they by
 
03:02:19.130 --> 03:02:19.140 align:start position:0%
weight and cannabis
 
03:02:21.710 --> 03:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
fennel would be much easier to to sell
 
03:02:22.910 --> 03:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
because you wouldn't pay as much tax
 
03:02:24.889 --> 03:02:24.899 align:start position:0%
because it's 50 times stronger than a
 
03:02:27.050 --> 03:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
comparable dose of a smaller product so
 
03:02:28.370 --> 03:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
if you're just comparing it that way
 
03:02:31.190 --> 03:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's it doesn't make sense to do that
 
03:02:34.190 --> 03:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
um and another thing is uh it was
 
03:02:35.510 --> 03:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
briefly mentioned it's not a major
 
03:02:38.150 --> 03:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
concern but talents uh opting out should
 
03:02:41.090 --> 03:02:41.100 align:start position:0%
not benefit from the business that they
 
03:02:42.650 --> 03:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
don't want to allow in their talent so I
 
03:02:45.050 --> 03:02:45.060 align:start position:0%
don't think it's it's a good idea to
 
03:02:46.849 --> 03:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
reward towns to say well we don't want
 
03:02:48.230 --> 03:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
your business here but we'll take your
 
03:02:50.330 --> 03:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
money so I think that's a good thing to
 
03:02:52.429 --> 03:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
leave in the bill
 
03:02:54.469 --> 03:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
um and lastly we have to look at the I
 
03:02:56.630 --> 03:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
you know the New Hampshire Advantage you
 
03:02:58.370 --> 03:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
know we we consider ourselves low tax
 
03:03:00.590 --> 03:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's a big Advantage we have right now
 
03:03:02.809 --> 03:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
that Advantage goes to Vermont Maine and
 
03:03:04.550 --> 03:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because it's illegal here
 
03:03:05.929 --> 03:03:05.939 align:start position:0%
so it's imperative that this goes
 
03:03:07.790 --> 03:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
through so that we can actually apply
 
03:03:09.230 --> 03:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire advantage to this
 
03:03:10.730 --> 03:03:10.740 align:start position:0%
industry so we're not losing money not
 
03:03:13.370 --> 03:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
losing jobs and this isn't a ways and
 
03:03:14.570 --> 03:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
means concern but we heard a lot of
 
03:03:16.250 --> 03:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
concerns about driving under the
 
03:03:17.990 --> 03:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
influence and all these other things
 
03:03:20.030 --> 03:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
right now we expect people to drive
 
03:03:22.730 --> 03:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
further and longer to get their cannabis
 
03:03:24.290 --> 03:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
to bring it back to New Hampshire that's
 
03:03:26.570 --> 03:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
what's happening the reality so if we
 
03:03:28.130 --> 03:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
want to decrease that I think we need to
 
03:03:31.309 --> 03:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
have it legalized uh in State uh and and
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
lastly we have to think about uh what if
 
03:03:34.849 --> 03:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
there's mail order that's allowed at the
 
03:03:36.769 --> 03:03:36.779 align:start position:0%
federal level uh what do we do then
 
03:03:38.210 --> 03:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
we're going to be in a situation where
 
03:03:40.250 --> 03:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
it's going to be like Amazon
 
03:03:41.450 --> 03:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
um you know I grew up in Philadelphia
 
03:03:43.610 --> 03:03:43.620 align:start position:0%
and I love the soft pretzels I know a
 
03:03:45.889 --> 03:03:45.899 align:start position:0%
guy he can get us a soft pretzels here I
 
03:03:47.090 --> 03:03:47.100 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay the rooms and meals
 
03:03:48.650 --> 03:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
tax if I did that but I don't I don't do
 
03:03:50.690 --> 03:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
it I have a guy who
 
03:03:53.090 --> 03:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
just gives me free pretzels sorry
 
03:03:55.250 --> 03:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
um anyway uh
 
03:03:57.410 --> 03:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
don't want to incriminate myself
 
03:03:59.450 --> 03:03:59.460 align:start position:0%
um you know and the other thing is you
 
03:04:00.769 --> 03:04:00.779 align:start position:0%
know the same thing with other products
 
03:04:02.450 --> 03:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh we're we're trying to tax something
 
03:04:05.990 --> 03:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
based on uh quality and people are
 
03:04:07.790 --> 03:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
paying for different products if you
 
03:04:09.410 --> 03:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
want to tax at the cultivation level
 
03:04:11.330 --> 03:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
that would be like taxing not beer or
 
03:04:14.090 --> 03:04:14.100 align:start position:0%
wine or the the product that's already
 
03:04:17.269 --> 03:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh made it would be like taxing flour
 
03:04:19.969 --> 03:04:19.979 align:start position:0%
and bakeries you know a baker can do
 
03:04:22.429 --> 03:04:22.439 align:start position:0%
take some flour make a three dollar loaf
 
03:04:23.570 --> 03:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
of bread or they can take it and make it
 
03:04:26.090 --> 03:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
into a a 35 pastry at a five-star
 
03:04:28.070 --> 03:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
restaurant how do you tax that if you're
 
03:04:30.590 --> 03:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
just taxing flour uh it's it's something
 
03:04:33.050 --> 03:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
that really needs to be addressed so I
 
03:04:35.330 --> 03:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
think the takeaway is I I do believe we
 
03:04:37.250 --> 03:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
should go back to rooms and meals uh
 
03:04:39.950 --> 03:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
model uh we heard testimony that
 
03:04:40.910 --> 03:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
there'll be more cultivate there are
 
03:04:42.410 --> 03:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
more cultivators in Vermont than there
 
03:04:45.889 --> 03:04:45.899 align:start position:0%
are the retailers and
 
03:04:47.389 --> 03:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
um it's it's not something that we don't
 
03:04:49.969 --> 03:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
know how to do we do it now uh it's
 
03:04:51.710 --> 03:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
already being done it's not a new tax
 
03:04:53.809 --> 03:04:53.819 align:start position:0%
and I think it could be easily applied
 
03:04:55.309 --> 03:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
to this and it would be the most fair
 
03:04:57.530 --> 03:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
and Equitable way of of taxing a product
 
03:04:59.710 --> 03:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
in a state without negatively
 
03:05:02.090 --> 03:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
influencing how things are grown how
 
03:05:04.670 --> 03:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
strong we expect things to be made or
 
03:05:06.650 --> 03:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
how safe a product it'll be I think
 
03:05:08.990 --> 03:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
consumers will be the ultimate Arbiter
 
03:05:11.150 --> 03:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
of what something should cost and I
 
03:05:12.650 --> 03:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
think we need to allow that and allow
 
03:05:14.809 --> 03:05:14.819 align:start position:0%
that free market to occur I'd be happy
 
03:05:16.790 --> 03:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
to take any questions and I know it's
 
03:05:18.590 --> 03:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
almost lunch time so
 
03:05:22.429 --> 03:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:24.170 --> 03:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
I think we're all set for now thank you
 
03:05:25.610 --> 03:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:05:28.429 --> 03:05:28.439 align:start position:0%
okay uh chair will recognize Frank Knack
 
03:05:30.950 --> 03:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
I hope I get that right scl-a-c-l-u of
 
03:05:50.570 --> 03:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:52.130 --> 03:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair members of the committee
 
03:05:53.269 --> 03:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
03:05:55.370 --> 03:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
testify my name is Frank Knack I'm the
 
03:05:56.990 --> 03:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
policy director with the ACLU of New
 
03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:58.490 align:start position:0%
policy director with the ACLU of New
Hampshire

03:05:58.490 --> 03:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:06:02.030 --> 03:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
um we're we're in in support of HB 639
 
03:06:04.010 --> 03:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
for two real reasons one from a harm
 
03:06:05.690 --> 03:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
reduction perspective and a second from
 
03:06:08.150 --> 03:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
a racial Justice perspective many of
 
03:06:10.429 --> 03:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
these policy um
 
03:06:12.410 --> 03:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
policy decisions for the reason that we
 
03:06:13.730 --> 03:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
support this I think are outside the
 
03:06:14.929 --> 03:06:14.939 align:start position:0%
scope of what you all want to talk about
 
03:06:17.330 --> 03:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
today so I'll try and focus on a few
 
03:06:20.450 --> 03:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
Revenue related issues one is the shadow
 
03:06:22.910 --> 03:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
tax that prohibition currently has in
 
03:06:24.349 --> 03:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so we heard a little
 
03:06:25.610 --> 03:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
bit about this when it was being
 
03:06:28.250 --> 03:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
introduced so our national office a few
 
03:06:30.530 --> 03:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
years back did an economic analysis of
 
03:06:32.330 --> 03:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
the cost of marijuana enforcement so
 
03:06:34.610 --> 03:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
because when there's an arrest there are
 
03:06:35.929 --> 03:06:35.939 align:start position:0%
multiple actors involved from law
 
03:06:38.450 --> 03:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
enforcement courts
 
03:06:40.790 --> 03:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
um other administrators and it has a
 
03:06:42.830 --> 03:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
severe cost and so looking at the number
 
03:06:44.570 --> 03:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
of arrests in New Hampshire last year
 
03:06:47.150 --> 03:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
which was over 1100 and plugging that
 
03:06:48.650 --> 03:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
into the methodology that our national
 
03:06:51.290 --> 03:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
office uh created we're spending about
 
03:06:54.530 --> 03:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
2.6 million dollars every year on the
 
03:06:56.450 --> 03:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
enforcement of just marijuana possession
 
03:06:58.969 --> 03:06:58.979 align:start position:0%
laws alone in New Hampshire and so
 
03:07:01.010 --> 03:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
taking aside the revenue that could be
 
03:07:02.450 --> 03:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
coming in just looking at what we're
 
03:07:04.250 --> 03:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
actually spending now on marijuana
 
03:07:08.389 --> 03:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
possession and that 2.6 million does not
 
03:07:10.370 --> 03:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
include any of the collateral harms of a
 
03:07:12.469 --> 03:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
Marijuana arrest and so that makes it
 
03:07:13.969 --> 03:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
harder for an individual individual to
 
03:07:16.670 --> 03:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
get housing to get employment around
 
03:07:19.130 --> 03:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
child custody issues ETC and all those
 
03:07:20.570 --> 03:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
that have additional costs that are
 
03:07:22.849 --> 03:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
impacting our state and I did a quick
 
03:07:25.130 --> 03:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
search of the collateral consequences
 
03:07:27.170 --> 03:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
that attach to any misdemeanor offense
 
03:07:29.410 --> 03:07:29.420 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire according to the
 
03:07:31.490 --> 03:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
National inventory of collateral
 
03:07:34.010 --> 03:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
consequences there are 99 separate
 
03:07:35.990 --> 03:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
collateral consequences that attach
 
03:07:38.510 --> 03:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
mandatorily attached to any misdemeanor
 
03:07:40.790 --> 03:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
conviction in New Hampshire and so again
 
03:07:42.410 --> 03:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
those are all additional harms that are
 
03:07:45.410 --> 03:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
having a cost on our communities and the
 
03:07:46.730 --> 03:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
second piece I want to quickly touch on
 
03:07:48.410 --> 03:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
is the fiscal note and so I think we
 
03:07:50.450 --> 03:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
heard from the Chiefs that they expect
 
03:07:51.590 --> 03:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
there would be additional law
 
03:07:53.030 --> 03:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement costs and if you actually
 
03:07:55.250 --> 03:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
look at the data the opposite issue so
 
03:07:57.410 --> 03:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
when the chief spoke last year and
 
03:07:59.750 --> 03:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
testified on this bill with with a with
 
03:08:01.969 --> 03:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
more testimony they talked about quote
 
03:08:04.790 --> 03:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
unquote spillover crime is that when
 
03:08:06.769 --> 03:08:06.779 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts legalized when Vermont
 
03:08:08.929 --> 03:08:08.939 align:start position:0%
legalized when Maine legalized there was
 
03:08:10.670 --> 03:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
spillover crime because those States had
 
03:08:12.830 --> 03:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
legalized and it impacted New Hampshire
 
03:08:15.410 --> 03:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
and so we wanted to have a fact-based
 
03:08:16.670 --> 03:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
discussion about this and so we actually
 
03:08:18.950 --> 03:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
looked at crime stats data from the New
 
03:08:20.929 --> 03:08:20.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Safety uh
 
03:08:23.510 --> 03:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
beginning in 2016 when Maine legalized
 
03:08:27.170 --> 03:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
2017 when Mass legalized 2018 when
 
03:08:29.330 --> 03:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
Vermont legalized and so when they
 
03:08:31.370 --> 03:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
testified about that last year crime in
 
03:08:33.290 --> 03:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire between the first year of
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
legalization and that most recent data
 
03:08:38.510 --> 03:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
was down 22 percent fast forward one
 
03:08:40.969 --> 03:08:40.979 align:start position:0%
year crime is now down 26 percent so the
 
03:08:42.469 --> 03:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
notion that there's any type of
 
03:08:44.090 --> 03:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
spillover crime happening because of
 
03:08:45.710 --> 03:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
marijuana and its increasing law
 
03:08:45.720 --> 03:08:47.269 align:start position:0%
marijuana and its increasing law
enforcement

03:08:47.269 --> 03:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:08:50.210 --> 03:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
um requirements is is not based in
 
03:08:52.849 --> 03:08:52.859 align:start position:0%
actual data and also we heard we've
 
03:08:54.469 --> 03:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
heard concerns about and we see in the
 
03:08:56.090 --> 03:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
fiscal note around youth use around
 
03:08:57.710 --> 03:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
traffic fatality so I don't want to get
 
03:08:59.510 --> 03:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
into the weeds too much and and we have
 
03:09:02.090 --> 03:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
citations that a number of academic and
 
03:09:04.429 --> 03:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
medical journals uh going through many
 
03:09:05.870 --> 03:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
of these but I'll just point to one
 
03:09:07.550 --> 03:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
quickly around youth use because I think
 
03:09:08.809 --> 03:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
that's an issue that comes up quite
 
03:09:10.730 --> 03:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
often and so this is an article from the
 
03:09:10.740 --> 03:09:12.290 align:start position:0%
often and so this is an article from the
association

03:09:12.290 --> 03:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
association
 
03:09:13.809 --> 03:09:13.819 align:start position:0%
um from the journal the medical America
 
03:09:15.769 --> 03:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
the Journal of the American Medical
 
03:09:18.710 --> 03:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
Association back in 2019 and what they
 
03:09:21.110 --> 03:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
found was this is regarding youth use of
 
03:09:23.450 --> 03:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
marijuana marijuana laws recreational
 
03:09:25.429 --> 03:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
marijuana laws were associated with an
 
03:09:27.590 --> 03:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
eight percent decrease in the odds of
 
03:09:29.150 --> 03:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
marijuana use and a nine percent
 
03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
decrease in the odds of frequent
 
03:09:33.830 --> 03:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana use by Youth and so the notion
 
03:09:35.570 --> 03:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
that we're going to see some huge uptick
 
03:09:37.429 --> 03:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
is again not supported by the evidence
 
03:09:38.929 --> 03:09:38.939 align:start position:0%
and so when you're looking at that in
 
03:09:40.910 --> 03:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note we're not seeing that in
 
03:09:42.590 --> 03:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
other states happy to answer any
 
03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:45.230 align:start position:0%
other states happy to answer any
questions

03:09:45.230 --> 03:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:46.910 --> 03:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
that's great thank you uh representative
 
03:09:46.920 --> 03:09:48.050 align:start position:0%
that's great thank you uh representative
Ulrich

03:09:48.050 --> 03:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
Ulrich
 
03:09:49.849 --> 03:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
which would be the better form of
 
03:09:54.469 --> 03:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
Taxation the 15 tax on the uh sale at or
 
03:09:56.030 --> 03:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
the growth
 
03:09:59.630 --> 03:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
or a sales tax so we were a member of
 
03:10:01.130 --> 03:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
the Coalition that came up with the uh
 
03:10:02.750 --> 03:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
worked on the original Bill language so
 
03:10:05.210 --> 03:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
we would support the original meals tax
 
03:10:07.610 --> 03:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
but we're also we're in support of the
 
03:10:11.929 --> 03:10:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:15.769 --> 03:10:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:17.929 --> 03:10:17.939 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much
 
03:10:20.809 --> 03:10:20.819 align:start position:0%
okay I have a pink card from Jenny

Jenny Jenny would you be open to joining
 
03:10:27.830 --> 03:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
us at a work session or is there
 
03:10:29.210 --> 03:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
something specific you'd like to just
 
03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:34.490 --> 03:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you so much I appreciate that and
 
03:10:39.290 --> 03:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
then uh Bruce and Keane from the dra is
 
03:10:40.730 --> 03:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
there something specific you wanted to
 
03:10:42.590 --> 03:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
say for the record would you would you
 
03:10:45.050 --> 03:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
join us for the work session work
 
03:10:46.910 --> 03:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
session okay now I don't have a card
 
03:10:49.969 --> 03:10:49.979 align:start position:0%
from The Liquor Commission
 
03:10:52.070 --> 03:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
um would you be open to joining us at a
 
03:10:54.050 --> 03:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
work session okay that'd be great

representative all me
 
03:11:00.830 --> 03:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and I think on Matt Simon's
 
03:11:06.110 --> 03:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
chart probably is only for our region
 
03:11:08.990 --> 03:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
no it's for the whole country
 
03:11:13.790 --> 03:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:16.190 --> 03:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
okay that was a long public hearing for
 
03:11:19.370 --> 03:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
us uh yes representative fellows yes I'd
 
03:11:21.349 --> 03:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
just like to ask if you can have our
 
03:11:24.230 --> 03:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
researcher put together some information
 
03:11:24.240 --> 03:11:26.690 align:start position:0%
researcher put together some information
about

03:11:26.690 --> 03:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:11:29.269 --> 03:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
um what I've been hearing people say
 
03:11:32.510 --> 03:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
something about when we have do licenses
 
03:11:32.520 --> 03:11:35.110 align:start position:0%
something about when we have do licenses
and

03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:38.210 --> 03:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
certifications that somehow
 
03:11:41.469 --> 03:11:41.479 align:start position:0%
those amounts are only supposed to
 
03:11:46.910 --> 03:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:46.920 --> 03:11:48.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:11:48.410 --> 03:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:52.610 --> 03:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
issue and to do inspections related to
 
03:11:55.190 --> 03:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
those licenses we heard it for oplc and
 
03:11:57.889 --> 03:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
we heard it again here I just I I just
 
03:12:00.290 --> 03:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
don't really understand that concept we
 
03:12:02.210 --> 03:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
have some resident experts in this
 
03:12:04.610 --> 03:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
committee on that topic I believe so
 
03:12:06.290 --> 03:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
during our work session we can talk
 
03:12:08.389 --> 03:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
about that with the difference between a
 
03:12:10.990 --> 03:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
fee is an attacks that part I understand
 
03:12:14.990 --> 03:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
what what I'm what was new to me was to
 
03:12:19.130 --> 03:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
hear director Courtney say that it's
 
03:12:23.389 --> 03:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
somehow it's illegal to establish fees
 
03:12:27.050 --> 03:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
for a license that that raise more money
 
03:12:29.330 --> 03:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
than is needed to operate the program
 
03:12:31.730 --> 03:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
which would include the actual licensing
 
03:12:35.870 --> 03:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
and expense expenditures for
 
03:12:39.590 --> 03:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
um you know inspectors and supporting
 
03:12:41.690 --> 03:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
whatever board is connected to that
 
03:12:43.490 --> 03:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
license that's the part that I don't
 
03:12:46.130 --> 03:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
understand okay great
 
03:12:47.929 --> 03:12:47.939 align:start position:0%
um I don't have any other pink cards to
 
03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill
 
03:12:52.730 --> 03:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
okay with that I will go ahead represent
 
03:12:54.530 --> 03:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
the balmy
 
03:12:58.090 --> 03:12:58.100 align:start position:0%
on with regard to the previous question
 
03:13:02.210 --> 03:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
on we were taught long ago in this
 
03:13:04.969 --> 03:13:04.979 align:start position:0%
committee that there's 125 percent rule
 
03:13:08.330 --> 03:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
on 25 percent for General administrative
 
03:13:11.150 --> 03:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
costs of the state but
 
03:13:15.710 --> 03:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
on I also had a run-in with the
 
03:13:15.720 --> 03:13:17.389 align:start position:0%
on I also had a run-in with the
Comptroller

03:13:17.389 --> 03:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
Comptroller
 
03:13:20.690 --> 03:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
on dedicated funds A couple of years ago
 
03:13:23.870 --> 03:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
who we had a dedicated fund which is
 
03:13:27.290 --> 03:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
still now charging uh charging enough
 
03:13:30.050 --> 03:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
that 70 percent of it lapses to the
 
03:13:34.790 --> 03:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
state every two years on and she said
 
03:13:37.370 --> 03:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
that as long as this was written into
 
03:13:40.370 --> 03:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
the law which it was that it is legal
 
03:13:45.230 --> 03:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
and that that you can't touch it without
 
03:13:47.450 --> 03:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
going and putting in a special Bill to
 
03:13:50.389 --> 03:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
change that law now I'd like to get the
 
03:13:53.809 --> 03:13:53.819 align:start position:0%
Comptroller in here to try and get that
 
03:13:57.349 --> 03:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
figured out because olpc is also going
 
03:13:59.450 --> 03:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
in the other direction
 
03:14:02.929 --> 03:14:02.939 align:start position:0%
and I think it it doesn't just apply to
 
03:14:05.690 --> 03:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
here it also applies generally to how we
 
03:14:07.190 --> 03:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
handle things
 
03:14:10.370 --> 03:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh with that we will
 
03:14:12.490 --> 03:14:12.500 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing and House Bill
 
03:14:16.010 --> 03:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
639 and we will schedule a work session
 
03:14:18.650 --> 03:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
so please all of you who are here if
 
03:14:20.269 --> 03:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
you'd like to join us for that that way
 
03:14:22.250 --> 03:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
maybe we can pick your brain a little
 
03:14:24.530 --> 03:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
bit more thank you very much so when the
 
03:14:26.210 --> 03:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
committee will take a break until one
 
03:14:28.309 --> 03:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
and then we have another public hearing
 
04:08:39.070 --> 04:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:42.889 --> 04:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
assessed after the the fees uh that the
 
04:08:44.570 --> 04:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
fund balances and the fees be assessed
 
04:08:48.050 --> 04:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
after the uh passage of the law to make
 
04:08:51.050 --> 04:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
sure that they were uh consistent with
 
04:08:52.910 --> 04:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
the me with the
 
04:08:56.870 --> 04:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
um purposes of the chapter uh then I'd
 
04:08:58.729 --> 04:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
be comfortable with that but simply
 
04:09:00.889 --> 04:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
saying any excess fees should go into
 
04:09:03.490 --> 04:09:03.500 align:start position:0%
the into the general fund and not having
 
04:09:06.170 --> 04:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
further oversight of that I think is
 
04:09:09.290 --> 04:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
would run into the same problem where uh
 
04:09:12.830 --> 04:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
if the fees are really not uh
 
04:09:15.110 --> 04:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
in line with the amount that they're
 
04:09:18.110 --> 04:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
need that that's needed to fund the
 
04:09:20.750 --> 04:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
program and if they're excessive then
 
04:09:24.229 --> 04:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
the fees should be reduced if the um
 
04:09:28.490 --> 04:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
if they are uh substantially ins um
 
04:09:30.950 --> 04:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
under what's needed then the feeds would
 
04:09:32.330 --> 04:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
need to be increased
 
04:09:33.889 --> 04:09:33.899 align:start position:0%
but I don't think we can really tell
 
04:09:37.330 --> 04:09:37.340 align:start position:0%
until we make a change that uh to
 
04:09:40.010 --> 04:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
clarify the administration of them
 
04:09:42.410 --> 04:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
04:09:45.710 --> 04:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
okay you're establishing a non-lapsing
 
04:09:45.720 --> 04:09:46.729 align:start position:0%
okay you're establishing a non-lapsing
fund

04:09:46.729 --> 04:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:09:49.130 --> 04:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
it's non-lapsing so
 
04:09:50.510 --> 04:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get that information
 
04:09:54.590 --> 04:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
because the money just sits there
 
04:09:58.250 --> 04:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
so unless we have some mechanism that
 
04:10:01.250 --> 04:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
says after we do all of our job we have
 
04:10:03.229 --> 04:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
ten dollars left over what are you going
 
04:10:05.809 --> 04:10:05.819 align:start position:0%
to do with that ten dollars is is the
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
question right uh so uh if if the if in
 
04:10:14.210 --> 04:10:14.220 align:start position:0%
the Years work ten dollars is left over
 
04:10:19.550 --> 04:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
after uh the approximate the fund the
 
04:10:22.070 --> 04:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
the those fees generate about
 
04:10:23.870 --> 04:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
um five to six thousand a hundred
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per year uh and if ten
 
04:10:30.170 --> 04:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
dollars is left over after a year then
 
04:10:33.050 --> 04:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
that goes that can you know certainly
 
04:10:35.090 --> 04:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
carry over to the next year where there
 
04:10:38.269 --> 04:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
might be a slight shortfall uh if we're
 
04:10:40.370 --> 04:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
if it turns out that it is only taking
 
04:10:44.809 --> 04:10:44.819 align:start position:0%
three hundred thousand dollars to uh to
 
04:10:47.570 --> 04:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
run the program then
 
04:10:50.090 --> 04:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
and do all the necessary work of the
 
04:10:53.570 --> 04:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
program uh then then the fees should be
 
04:10:53.580 --> 04:10:56.150 align:start position:0%
program uh then then the fees should be
reconsidered

04:10:56.150 --> 04:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
reconsidered
 
04:10:59.389 --> 04:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
uh if it turns out that it's actually
 
04:11:02.450 --> 04:11:02.460 align:start position:0%
taking a million dollars to uh
 
04:11:04.670 --> 04:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
to run the program the fees should also
 
04:11:08.030 --> 04:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
be reconsidered but if it's within say
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
25 percent uh then I think that that
 
04:11:14.689 --> 04:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
would be I think there's 125 rule in
 
04:11:18.530 --> 04:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
terms of what uh what fees are you know
 
04:11:21.530 --> 04:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
the the the margin between the amount
 
04:11:25.130 --> 04:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
drop brought in by fees and the uh and
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:32.090 --> 04:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh do you have another follow-up yep go
 
04:11:32.100 --> 04:11:32.929 align:start position:0%
uh do you have another follow-up yep go
ahead

04:11:32.929 --> 04:11:32.939 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
04:11:35.809 --> 04:11:35.819 align:start position:0%
so you would not be adverse to something
 
04:11:38.950 --> 04:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
like uh implementing what other
 
04:11:42.290 --> 04:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing plans have at the 125 rule
 
04:11:44.750 --> 04:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh I I think if it's consistent with
 
04:11:46.610 --> 04:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
what's done with other non-lapsing funds
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
I think that would be appropriate
 
04:11:51.349 --> 04:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative fellows I'm sorry first
 
04:11:53.269 --> 04:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go around yes
 
04:11:55.250 --> 04:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me what kind of problem
 
04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
you're supporting you're trying to fix
 
04:11:58.910 --> 04:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
with this because I I'm just really
 
04:11:58.920 --> 04:12:00.110 align:start position:0%
with this because I I'm just really
concerned

04:12:00.110 --> 04:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
04:12:02.689 --> 04:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
that I see it in this spill but I've
 
04:12:07.269 --> 04:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
also seen it in another context that it
 
04:12:12.110 --> 04:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's picking apart the very little tasks
 
04:12:15.250 --> 04:12:15.260 align:start position:0%
some very little tasks within an agency
 
04:12:18.410 --> 04:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
because instead of looking at it more
 
04:12:21.349 --> 04:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
holistically because like you've been
 
04:12:23.210 --> 04:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
they've been doing this job for a long
 
04:12:26.870 --> 04:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
time I'm sure so are they going to not
 
04:12:29.809 --> 04:12:29.819 align:start position:0%
be able to do it for some reason without
 
04:12:33.110 --> 04:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
unless they retain These funds well the
 
04:12:36.050 --> 04:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
problem that was
 
04:12:38.389 --> 04:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
the the that was brought out during the
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
study committee was that in fact they
 
04:12:43.849 --> 04:12:43.859 align:start position:0%
hadn't been doing the job that uh the
 
04:12:46.250 --> 04:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
department chapter 431 tasks the
 
04:12:49.790 --> 04:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
department with analyzing fertilizers
 
04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
and lime to make sure that the content
 
04:12:55.130 --> 04:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
is consistent with the labels this is a
 
04:12:58.130 --> 04:12:58.140 align:start position:0%
consumer protection issue it is also an
 
04:13:00.070 --> 04:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection issue
 
04:13:05.630 --> 04:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
because if the uh if you expect your
 
04:13:08.450 --> 04:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
fertilizer to be 10 10 10 and you're
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
only getting 888 then you're being
 
04:13:11.760 --> 04:13:12.889 align:start position:0%
only getting 888 then you're being
shorted

04:13:12.889 --> 04:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
shorted
 
04:13:16.610 --> 04:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
uh and that is and there are penalties
 
04:13:19.429 --> 04:13:19.439 align:start position:0%
for that but you actually there needs to
 
04:13:21.710 --> 04:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
be a sample of the fertilizer tested on
 
04:13:23.389 --> 04:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
a regular basis to determine whether
 
04:13:26.510 --> 04:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's being whether the producers are
 
04:13:30.250 --> 04:13:30.260 align:start position:0%
actually following their labels uh and
 
04:13:33.889 --> 04:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
uh that testing with the exception of a
 
04:13:35.570 --> 04:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
couple of complaints in the last year
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
was not being done
 
04:13:40.670 --> 04:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
so the department was in fact not
 
04:13:42.410 --> 04:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
carrying through its obligations under
 
04:13:44.809 --> 04:13:44.819 align:start position:0%
the statute and one of the reasons was
 
04:13:46.729 --> 04:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
that the resources of the department
 
04:13:48.969 --> 04:13:48.979 align:start position:0%
were being diverted to other programs
 
04:13:51.950 --> 04:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
that are in a separate in different
 
04:13:55.729 --> 04:13:55.739 align:start position:0%
chapters and for 43 upon one was not
 
04:13:57.889 --> 04:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
being actually overseen the way it was
 
04:14:00.849 --> 04:14:00.859 align:start position:0%
supposed to be uh if the money is
 
04:14:05.269 --> 04:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
dedicated to chapter 431 then that's
 
04:14:07.010 --> 04:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
what the money needs to be spent for and
 
04:14:09.769 --> 04:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
the resources need to be spent for
 
04:14:11.630 --> 04:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
okay a bunch of hands representative all
 
04:14:13.429 --> 04:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
me and then representative spilsbury
 
04:14:13.439 --> 04:14:14.630 align:start position:0%
me and then representative spilsbury
next

04:14:14.630 --> 04:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
next
 
04:14:16.070 --> 04:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:14:16.080 --> 04:14:17.210 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:14:17.210 --> 04:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:19.670 --> 04:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
I seem to remember from the dedicated
 
04:14:21.530 --> 04:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
funds committee which is the one that
 
04:14:24.050 --> 04:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
looks at these things
 
04:14:27.710 --> 04:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
and that there are several other
 
04:14:27.720 --> 04:14:30.170 align:start position:0%
and that there are several other
dedicated

04:14:30.170 --> 04:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
04:14:32.809 --> 04:14:32.819 align:start position:0%
um agricultural materials
 
04:14:37.309 --> 04:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
on funds uh there are dead
 
04:14:39.590 --> 04:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
um there are dedicated funds associated
 
04:14:42.710 --> 04:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
with pesticides uh there are dedicated
 
04:14:46.250 --> 04:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
funds associated with
 
04:14:46.260 --> 04:14:47.990 align:start position:0%
funds associated with
um

04:14:47.990 --> 04:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:51.650 --> 04:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
the sum of the revenue from uh animal
 
04:14:57.830 --> 04:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
feed goes into uh the fund that uh
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
deals with weights and measures another
 
04:15:02.689 --> 04:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
portion of that that goes into
 
04:15:07.010 --> 04:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
um a fund that deals with animal health
 
04:15:10.450 --> 04:15:10.460 align:start position:0%
by funding the veterinary pathology
 
04:15:16.189 --> 04:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Diagnostic lab uh and I'm not
 
04:15:18.050 --> 04:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
sure there may be
 
04:15:19.729 --> 04:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
there I know that there are you know
 
04:15:21.110 --> 04:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
there are a number of different fees
 
04:15:22.910 --> 04:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
that the department charges I'm not sure
 
04:15:22.920 --> 04:15:24.290 align:start position:0%
that the department charges I'm not sure
exactly

04:15:24.290 --> 04:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
04:15:26.570 --> 04:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
how many of those go into General the
 
04:15:28.189 --> 04:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
general fund how many of those go into
 
04:15:33.410 --> 04:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds uh and uh this bill was
 
04:15:35.090 --> 04:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
specific specifically came out of the
 
04:15:37.130 --> 04:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
soil conditioner study committee so we
 
04:15:39.229 --> 04:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
were just dealing with chapter 431 it
 
04:15:41.870 --> 04:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
was a recommendation specific from that
 
04:15:44.210 --> 04:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
study committee we did not do an overall
 
04:15:47.150 --> 04:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
study of dedicated funds in the entire
 
04:15:47.160 --> 04:15:48.889 align:start position:0%
study of dedicated funds in the entire
department

04:15:48.889 --> 04:15:48.899 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:15:53.030 --> 04:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and could I just ask also sure
 
04:15:53.040 --> 04:15:54.969 align:start position:0%
thank you and could I just ask also sure
on

04:15:54.969 --> 04:15:54.979 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:15:58.910 --> 04:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
would any of the general
 
04:16:00.950 --> 04:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
fund money that goes to the Department
 
04:16:04.550 --> 04:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture be reduced because you're
 
04:16:07.969 --> 04:16:07.979 align:start position:0%
taking off this smallish piece
 
04:16:11.150 --> 04:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
um I do not know that is I I would it
 
04:16:14.330 --> 04:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
would it would seem appropriate that uh
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
if the department was not did not need
 
04:16:19.969 --> 04:16:19.979 align:start position:0%
to ask for that roughly half a million
 
04:16:24.469 --> 04:16:24.479 align:start position:0%
dollars in order to be able to run the
 
04:16:28.250 --> 04:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
um run in order in order to oversee 431
 
04:16:30.170 --> 04:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
then they wouldn't need to ask for that
 
04:16:32.929 --> 04:16:32.939 align:start position:0%
as a as an additional line item it would
 
04:16:34.849 --> 04:16:34.859 align:start position:0%
depend on what exactly what they asked
 
04:16:36.849 --> 04:16:36.859 align:start position:0%
for would depend on
 
04:16:39.590 --> 04:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
the balance of
 
04:16:43.189 --> 04:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
um what they their program costs and
 
04:16:45.830 --> 04:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
um and the revenues and I don't know
 
04:16:48.170 --> 04:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
I don't have access I I did not look
 
04:16:50.750 --> 04:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
into the details of those costs and
 
04:16:50.760 --> 04:16:52.910 align:start position:0%
into the details of those costs and
revenues

04:16:52.910 --> 04:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
04:16:55.010 --> 04:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
04:16:57.229 --> 04:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:17:00.229 --> 04:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
from what I'm hearing I believe that you
 
04:17:03.650 --> 04:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
are recognizing that the there could be
 
04:17:07.309 --> 04:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
an evolving imbalance between the fees
 
04:17:10.309 --> 04:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
generated in the costs to fulfill the
 
04:17:13.790 --> 04:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
purpose you can go in either direction
 
04:17:16.670 --> 04:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
so I would have thought that the way to
 
04:17:18.769 --> 04:17:18.779 align:start position:0%
maintain a dynamic balance between the
 
04:17:21.349 --> 04:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
fee and the anticipated costs is through
 
04:17:23.110 --> 04:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
the biennial
 
04:17:27.170 --> 04:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
budgeting process what's the incentive
 
04:17:29.330 --> 04:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
if we have a dedicated fund where the
 
04:17:31.309 --> 04:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
fees can accumulate
 
04:17:34.090 --> 04:17:34.100 align:start position:0%
to periodically revisit and
 
04:17:37.790 --> 04:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
re-re-rebalance the fee versus the costs
 
04:17:39.530 --> 04:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
and I have a second question if I may
 
04:17:47.210 --> 04:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
one uh I don't know that we could it
 
04:17:54.790 --> 04:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
could be amended so that there was some
 
04:17:57.889 --> 04:17:57.899 align:start position:0%
rebalancing mechanism included I don't
 
04:18:00.170 --> 04:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
know if that's generally done with uh
 
04:18:04.969 --> 04:18:04.979 align:start position:0%
with dedicated funds and uh what I um
 
04:18:08.809 --> 04:18:08.819 align:start position:0%
but if that is an uh an ordinary
 
04:18:11.450 --> 04:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
practice of this committee then uh that
 
04:18:13.490 --> 04:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate
 
04:18:17.450 --> 04:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
um and uh if there is
 
04:18:20.689 --> 04:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
um if there is a marked imbalance in in
 
04:18:22.910 --> 04:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
terms of a shortfall that is something
 
04:18:26.330 --> 04:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
that the the commissioner of the
 
04:18:29.150 --> 04:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
department could say okay this uh
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund covers this proportion of
 
04:18:34.729 --> 04:18:34.739 align:start position:0%
our costs for the program but we're
 
04:18:37.670 --> 04:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
going to need more uh and from the
 
04:18:40.510 --> 04:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
general fund uh and certainly there are
 
04:18:42.969 --> 04:18:42.979 align:start position:0%
programs in the Department of
 
04:18:46.610 --> 04:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
Agriculture that are supported more by
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
general fund dollars and other poor than
 
04:18:52.610 --> 04:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
other portions uh if it is if the fees
 
04:18:55.610 --> 04:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
are substantially too high then we could
 
04:19:01.809 --> 04:19:01.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:07.849 --> 04:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:10.370 --> 04:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
do you not think that your argument or
 
04:19:13.130 --> 04:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
your concern if it was applied broadly
 
04:19:15.170 --> 04:19:15.180 align:start position:0%
across the realm of state government
 
04:19:17.870 --> 04:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
would imply that every place that
 
04:19:19.370 --> 04:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
there's a fee there should be a
 
04:19:22.370 --> 04:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund associated with it
 
04:19:24.469 --> 04:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
and I think the norm is actually more
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
the way the law stands currently where
 
04:19:27.889 --> 04:19:27.899 align:start position:0%
the fees go into the general fund and
 
04:19:29.210 --> 04:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
then they're subject to biennial
 
04:19:29.220 --> 04:19:32.689 align:start position:0%
then they're subject to biennial
appropriation

04:19:32.689 --> 04:19:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:36.830 --> 04:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
I think that uh in a case where the fees
 
04:19:41.330 --> 04:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
clear clearly have not been uh reapplied
 
04:19:44.450 --> 04:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
appropriately then what we are looking
 
04:19:49.870 --> 04:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
at is a is de facto uh
 
04:19:53.150 --> 04:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
disproportionate taxation rather than
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
uh rather than management of fees if if
 
04:19:59.590 --> 04:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
a fertilizer manufacturer
 
04:20:03.290 --> 04:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
pays us pays a registration fee on their
 
04:20:04.729 --> 04:20:04.739 align:start position:0%
on what they're selling into New
 
04:20:04.739 --> 04:20:05.809 align:start position:0%
on what they're selling into New
Hampshire

04:20:05.809 --> 04:20:05.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:20:09.410 --> 04:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
and they expect that the effect of what
 
04:20:11.090 --> 04:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
they're paying is going to be that
 
04:20:12.110 --> 04:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a Level Playing
 
04:20:14.570 --> 04:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
Field so there will be testing to make
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
sure that nobody is cheating
 
04:20:20.750 --> 04:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
and the it turns out that that service
 
04:20:23.689 --> 04:20:23.699 align:start position:0%
is not being provided by the state they
 
04:20:25.490 --> 04:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
are paying a section and that that money
 
04:20:27.889 --> 04:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
is going to say an Organic certification
 
04:20:27.899 --> 04:20:29.090 align:start position:0%
is going to say an Organic certification
program

04:20:29.090 --> 04:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:20:32.570 --> 04:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
they are paying a tax that is going to
 
04:20:34.250 --> 04:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
some other purpose than what they're
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
paying the fee for and we need as
 
04:20:40.010 --> 04:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
legislators to make sure that our
 
04:20:44.990 --> 04:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey
 
04:20:49.250 --> 04:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:20:52.969 --> 04:20:52.979 align:start position:0%
okay not that familiar with four
 
04:20:52.979 --> 04:20:54.590 align:start position:0%
okay not that familiar with four
31.

04:20:54.590 --> 04:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
31.
 
04:20:56.090 --> 04:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
other than
 
04:20:58.189 --> 04:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
having known Don Wilson for many many
 
04:20:58.199 --> 04:21:00.530 align:start position:0%
having known Don Wilson for many many
years

04:21:00.530 --> 04:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:02.389 --> 04:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
04:21:05.830 --> 04:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
is every product sold in New Hampshire
 
04:21:09.530 --> 04:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
required to be tested or do we trust the
 
04:21:11.389 --> 04:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
label and
 
04:21:14.229 --> 04:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
um the department of Sean's Department
 
04:21:17.990 --> 04:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
Deals Only with complaints
 
04:21:21.349 --> 04:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
the statute says that it shall be tested
 
04:21:25.130 --> 04:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
it does not lay out the specific it does
 
04:21:26.689 --> 04:21:26.699 align:start position:0%
not say that every product shall be
 
04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
tested every year but it but uh the
 
04:21:32.510 --> 04:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
statute essentially indicates that a
 
04:21:34.689 --> 04:21:34.699 align:start position:0%
representative sample should be
 
04:21:44.570 --> 04:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:47.990 --> 04:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
if it's not required to be tested every
 
04:21:49.849 --> 04:21:49.859 align:start position:0%
year since shall be tested but it
 
04:21:53.389 --> 04:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't say why or when or how
 
04:21:58.070 --> 04:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
does not seem more reasonable to First
 
04:22:01.250 --> 04:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
mandate an expense and then pay for that
 
04:22:03.769 --> 04:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
expense than to just
 
04:22:06.110 --> 04:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
pay for something that isn't being done
 
04:22:10.250 --> 04:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
because it's only being done on demand
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
well the problem is that it should not
 
04:22:16.370 --> 04:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
that by Statute it should not be done
 
04:22:19.130 --> 04:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
only On Demand by Statute it should be
 
04:22:19.140 --> 04:22:19.910 align:start position:0%
only On Demand by Statute it should be
done

04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis
 
04:22:22.680 --> 04:22:24.070 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis
and

04:22:24.070 --> 04:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:22:25.990 --> 04:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
the department
 
04:22:31.610 --> 04:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
was failing uh for a number of years to
 
04:22:34.610 --> 04:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
carry through their requirement to test
 
04:22:37.610 --> 04:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
it on a regular basis
 
04:22:39.950 --> 04:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
and there are all sorts of reasons why
 
04:22:41.450 --> 04:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
the department is failing to do that
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
which I you can discuss with the
 
04:22:45.250 --> 04:22:45.260 align:start position:0%
commissioner and
 
04:22:49.610 --> 04:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
predecessor uh his when he told me that
 
04:22:51.530 --> 04:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
when his predecessor handed the
 
04:22:54.290 --> 04:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
department over to him she told him that
 
04:22:55.969 --> 04:22:55.979 align:start position:0%
the department was basically in triage
 
04:23:01.330 --> 04:23:01.340 align:start position:0%
mode uh and that does not
 
04:23:04.490 --> 04:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
it is has improved since then but there
 
04:23:07.370 --> 04:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
are there are a number of
 
04:23:12.429 --> 04:23:12.439 align:start position:0%
problems with the regulatory
 
04:23:14.689 --> 04:23:14.699 align:start position:0%
functions of the department that have to
 
04:23:17.710 --> 04:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
do with irregularities and funding The
 
04:23:21.110 --> 04:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
Organic certification program charges a
 
04:23:23.990 --> 04:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
fee that is minuscule compared to the
 
04:23:28.210 --> 04:23:28.220 align:start position:0%
cost of uh of operating that program
 
04:23:32.330 --> 04:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
uh the so essentially what was happening
 
04:23:34.269 --> 04:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
was that other
 
04:23:39.110 --> 04:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
fees were being used to prop up that
 
04:23:39.120 --> 04:23:42.410 align:start position:0%
fees were being used to prop up that
program

04:23:42.410 --> 04:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:45.469 --> 04:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
representative homie
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
would you believe that under Steve
 
04:23:50.399 --> 04:23:51.830 align:start position:0%
would you believe that under Steve
Taylor

04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
Taylor
 
04:23:55.010 --> 04:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
he bought bit every nickel in that
 
04:23:55.020 --> 04:23:56.090 align:start position:0%
he bought bit every nickel in that
department

04:23:56.090 --> 04:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:23:59.410 --> 04:23:59.420 align:start position:0%
and that is before the predecessor
 
04:24:02.030 --> 04:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
and he
 
04:24:05.650 --> 04:24:05.660 align:start position:0%
um he's a very frugal Yankee
 
04:24:08.630 --> 04:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:24:11.170 --> 04:24:11.180 align:start position:0%
when I was on
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
Finance I was on division one and the
 
04:24:16.849 --> 04:24:16.859 align:start position:0%
weights and measures people came to us
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
to try to ask for a new machine because
 
04:24:25.130 --> 04:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
they could no longer reliably do weights
 
04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
and measures and we asked them why
 
04:24:29.689 --> 04:24:29.699 align:start position:0%
didn't you put that in the budget and
 
04:24:31.729 --> 04:24:31.739 align:start position:0%
they said he wouldn't let us
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
so the department has been
 
04:24:35.760 --> 04:24:37.269 align:start position:0%
so the department has been
been

04:24:37.269 --> 04:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:24:39.950 --> 04:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
shortchanging all of the stuff it's
 
04:24:43.070 --> 04:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to do for a very long time now
 
04:24:46.309 --> 04:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
I would believe that and would you uh
 
04:24:48.229 --> 04:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
have you ever watched the finance
 
04:24:51.290 --> 04:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
committee look at the budget of the
 
04:24:54.530 --> 04:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture I watched part
 
04:24:58.370 --> 04:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
of it one year and uh
 
04:25:01.429 --> 04:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
I think it was the first year that
 
04:25:03.650 --> 04:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper was
 
04:25:08.510 --> 04:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
um was was working on it and I was
 
04:25:10.849 --> 04:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
pleased to see that commissioner Jasper
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
was actually arguing that his Department
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
should have more money rather than
 
04:25:20.929 --> 04:25:20.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:25.010 --> 04:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up but my point was did they
 
04:25:28.630 --> 04:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
actually look at any of the
 
04:25:32.030 --> 04:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
individual operations
 
04:25:34.269 --> 04:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
I do not know
 
04:25:37.910 --> 04:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what the budget process was
 
04:25:43.070 --> 04:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
um and uh and I I know that
 
04:25:43.080 --> 04:25:44.630 align:start position:0%
um and uh and I I know that
um the

04:25:44.630 --> 04:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:25:47.870 --> 04:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
current director of regulatory Services
 
04:25:52.309 --> 04:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
has been more vocal in terms of speaking
 
04:25:56.450 --> 04:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
about what needs are not being met and
 
04:25:57.889 --> 04:25:57.899 align:start position:0%
has been bringing that to commissioner
 
04:26:00.229 --> 04:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
Jasper but I don't know the details all
 
04:26:03.410 --> 04:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
the budgetary budgetary details of it
 
04:26:05.689 --> 04:26:05.699 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
04:26:07.429 --> 04:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am cheer
 
04:26:09.649 --> 04:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
not sure where to even start with this I
 
04:26:12.290 --> 04:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
one thing I know from being on the
 
04:26:14.330 --> 04:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
commission that
 
04:26:16.790 --> 04:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
recommended how to license mushroom
 
04:26:20.689 --> 04:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
Harvesters is is a and that was like
 
04:26:24.229 --> 04:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
four years ago I know that they have an
 
04:26:26.389 --> 04:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
issue with their database for the whole
 
04:26:28.670 --> 04:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
department or or you know lots of things
 
04:26:32.290 --> 04:26:32.300 align:start position:0%
that they have to keep track of and that
 
04:26:36.290 --> 04:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
seems to me that I've heard
 
04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
that the governor was
 
04:26:40.849 --> 04:26:40.859 align:start position:0%
I think agreeable to giving them some
 
04:26:43.610 --> 04:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
money to to get that put put money in
 
04:26:45.590 --> 04:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
the budget to get that database updated
 
04:26:48.590 --> 04:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
I think I heard that when commissioner
 
04:26:51.889 --> 04:26:51.899 align:start position:0%
Jasper was up for his renomination as
 
04:26:54.950 --> 04:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner in the spring
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
and then I also look at this and I see
 
04:27:00.769 --> 04:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
that you're telling us that they only
 
04:27:04.010 --> 04:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
did two fertilizer samples last year but
 
04:27:08.269 --> 04:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note says they did 4498
 
04:27:12.670 --> 04:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
samples or this says fertilizer res
 
04:27:16.550 --> 04:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
registration program but well okay maybe
 
04:27:19.010 --> 04:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
that's it they have to register
 
04:27:21.410 --> 04:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
their fertilizer and
 
04:27:24.649 --> 04:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
and but it only gets
 
04:27:28.790 --> 04:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
sampled only two out of 5 000 were
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
sampled I I just the whole the whole
 
04:27:34.189 --> 04:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
thing here is just
 
04:27:36.889 --> 04:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
not fitting together for me I understand
 
04:27:39.410 --> 04:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
that they that they need a new database
 
04:27:41.330 --> 04:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
and that that's mentioned in the fiscal
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
note but if this is all a mechanism to
 
04:27:47.630 --> 04:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
get there get them a database I don't
 
04:27:49.309 --> 04:27:49.319 align:start position:0%
think we need to go there I think that
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
that just needs to get approved in the
 
04:27:53.330 --> 04:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
budget so do you agree with that or can
 
04:27:55.309 --> 04:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
you shed some light on that I can shed
 
04:27:59.510 --> 04:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
some light on that the uh database is us
 
04:28:01.610 --> 04:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
is a different bill it went before
 
04:28:05.330 --> 04:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
Finance last week Finance retained it
 
04:28:06.889 --> 04:28:06.899 align:start position:0%
with the intention of putting in the
 
04:28:12.050 --> 04:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
budget uh and that database is the
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
um the so essentially what that bill
 
04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
does is it provides the setup cost for
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
the database the maintenance costs for
 
04:28:21.530 --> 04:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
the database will be paid for out of
 
04:28:25.070 --> 04:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
fees uh some of and that database would
 
04:28:26.450 --> 04:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
be covering more than just the
 
04:28:30.469 --> 04:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
fertilizer but the fees would be
 
04:28:30.479 --> 04:28:31.149 align:start position:0%
fertilizer but the fees would be
um

04:28:31.149 --> 04:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:33.830 --> 04:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
that are produced by fertilizer and the
 
04:28:36.050 --> 04:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
fees that are produced by other
 
04:28:36.060 --> 04:28:37.570 align:start position:0%
fees that are produced by other
regulatory

04:28:37.570 --> 04:28:37.580 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
04:28:41.630 --> 04:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
programs would contribute towards the
 
04:28:44.469 --> 04:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
cost of doing the database maintenance
 
04:28:48.349 --> 04:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
so uh so that database is something that
 
04:28:53.570 --> 04:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
is desperately needed and uh it is being
 
04:28:58.910 --> 04:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
done in the budget uh in terms of uh the
 
04:29:04.130 --> 04:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
handling of the fees uh the
 
04:29:04.140 --> 04:29:04.790 align:start position:0%
handling of the fees uh the
um

04:29:04.790 --> 04:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:08.809 --> 04:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
the way that this uh the the way that
 
04:29:10.370 --> 04:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
this bill is written in terms in terms
 
04:29:10.380 --> 04:29:11.570 align:start position:0%
this bill is written in terms in terms
of

04:29:11.570 --> 04:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:29:14.870 --> 04:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
um managing the fees is that some of the
 
04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
cost of the some of the fees that come
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
in through this will go towards
 
04:29:22.370 --> 04:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
um maintaining the database some will go
 
04:29:26.269 --> 04:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
towards the costs of doing the product
 
04:29:28.490 --> 04:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
analysis some some of the costs some
 
04:29:30.349 --> 04:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
will go towards the process of doing the
 
04:29:34.130 --> 04:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
product registrations so every time a
 
04:29:36.410 --> 04:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
fertilizer manufacturer or distributor
 
04:29:38.410 --> 04:29:38.420 align:start position:0%
wants to sell
 
04:29:41.269 --> 04:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh fertilizer in the state of New
 
04:29:45.229 --> 04:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they have to submit uh a a
 
04:29:50.210 --> 04:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
label and an application to do that and
 
04:29:54.769 --> 04:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
then those labels are uh processed by
 
04:29:57.950 --> 04:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
the the people in the department and uh
 
04:30:00.349 --> 04:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
there's a fee that is a that for for
 
04:30:02.929 --> 04:30:02.939 align:start position:0%
that process of registering which is 75
 
04:30:10.130 --> 04:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
per registration uh and uh that uh that
 
04:30:12.649 --> 04:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
fee is intended to cost to cover the
 
04:30:15.530 --> 04:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
cost of both processing the
 
04:30:16.849 --> 04:30:16.859 align:start position:0%
um the registrations up front
 
04:30:20.030 --> 04:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
maintaining them on record and doing
 
04:30:23.149 --> 04:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
periodic analysis of the product to make
 
04:30:27.530 --> 04:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
sure that it actually meets the label so
 
04:30:30.110 --> 04:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
the reason for putting this into a
 
04:30:32.990 --> 04:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
specific fund is to make sure that these
 
04:30:34.849 --> 04:30:34.859 align:start position:0%
monies are in fact used for those
 
04:30:34.859 --> 04:30:37.670 align:start position:0%
monies are in fact used for those
purposes

04:30:37.670 --> 04:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:37.680 --> 04:30:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:30:39.590 --> 04:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:30:39.600 --> 04:30:41.630 align:start position:0%
oh
so

04:30:41.630 --> 04:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:30:44.450 --> 04:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
until like does do we need to be
 
04:30:46.370 --> 04:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
you know registering the fertilizer
 
04:30:48.889 --> 04:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
that's a policy issue but just in terms
 
04:30:50.450 --> 04:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
of the money
 
04:30:53.630 --> 04:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
if if the general fund is going to pay
 
04:30:55.790 --> 04:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
for that database
 
04:30:58.189 --> 04:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't it make sense that some of the
 
04:31:01.070 --> 04:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
money from these fees should be lapsed
 
04:31:03.649 --> 04:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
to the general fund and otherwise you're
 
04:31:05.269 --> 04:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
going to get into this like I think it's
 
04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
called cost accounting where you nitpick
 
04:31:10.729 --> 04:31:10.739 align:start position:0%
like every little minute of like an
 
04:31:13.550 --> 04:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
employee's time and that I mean that's
 
04:31:15.170 --> 04:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to hire people just
 
04:31:17.630 --> 04:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
to keep track of that and I'm not going
 
04:31:21.349 --> 04:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
to say anything more so essentially the
 
04:31:23.149 --> 04:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
setting up of the database is a capital
 
04:31:23.159 --> 04:31:24.590 align:start position:0%
setting up of the database is a capital
expense

04:31:24.590 --> 04:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
expense
 
04:31:27.830 --> 04:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
and uh it makes sense to pay for that
 
04:31:29.630 --> 04:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
out of the general fund
 
04:31:31.969 --> 04:31:31.979 align:start position:0%
uh the maintenance the ongoing
 
04:31:35.870 --> 04:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the database is a
 
04:31:38.030 --> 04:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance expense and that will come
 
04:31:41.990 --> 04:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
out of the fee income uh from uh that
 
04:31:44.929 --> 04:31:44.939 align:start position:0%
would be in this dedicated fund and in
 
04:31:47.990 --> 04:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
other funds that the department has
 
04:31:49.969 --> 04:31:49.979 align:start position:0%
access to for their other registration
 
04:31:52.309 --> 04:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
and Licensing programs
 
04:31:54.050 --> 04:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative play
 
04:31:56.870 --> 04:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
yes from your testimony which I just
 
04:32:00.889 --> 04:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
mislaid there's a line in there about uh
 
04:32:04.250 --> 04:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
um the fees aren't generating enough to
 
04:32:05.750 --> 04:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of testing and that's why
 
04:32:07.070 --> 04:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
so so little is being done and
 
04:32:07.080 --> 04:32:08.269 align:start position:0%
so so little is being done and
paraphrasing

04:32:08.269 --> 04:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
why aren't you here asking for an
 
04:32:11.870 --> 04:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
increase in the fee
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:32:16.969 --> 04:32:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:19.729 --> 04:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
it's not that the fees are insufficient
 
04:32:21.590 --> 04:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
to do the testing is that the testing
 
04:32:24.769 --> 04:32:24.779 align:start position:0%
has not been has not been
 
04:32:27.710 --> 04:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
are done and the reason that the testing
 
04:32:29.889 --> 04:32:29.899 align:start position:0%
has not been done is that the resources
 
04:32:33.229 --> 04:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
for that testing were diverted to other
 
04:32:33.239 --> 04:32:36.889 align:start position:0%
for that testing were diverted to other
programs

04:32:36.889 --> 04:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:41.809 --> 04:32:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:49.969 --> 04:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
all right I do not have any more pink
 
04:32:49.979 --> 04:32:51.290 align:start position:0%
all right I do not have any more pink
cards

04:32:51.290 --> 04:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
cards
 
04:32:53.149 --> 04:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
no one else is here to speak on this
 
04:32:55.849 --> 04:32:55.859 align:start position:0%
bill no okay so we will now close the
 
04:32:59.870 --> 04:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 494.
 
04:33:03.889 --> 04:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
all right guys good work today uh safe
 
04:33:06.650 --> 04:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
travels tomorrow everything is canceled
 
04:33:10.189 --> 04:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:10.199 --> 04:33:12.529 align:start position:0%
 
everything

04:33:12.529 --> 04:33:12.539 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:33:15.410 --> 04:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
I believe so I did a quick I was looking
 
04:33:17.510 --> 04:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
at an email from Paul Smith I'm pretty
 
04:33:22.189 --> 04:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:22.199 --> 04:33:23.570 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:33:23.570 --> 04:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:23.580 --> 04:33:24.529 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:33:24.529 --> 04:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:27.650 --> 04:33:27.660 align:start position:0%
enjoy yourself and your snow day plan to
 
04:33:30.189 --> 04:33:30.199 align:start position:0%
be here at 11 A.M on Wednesday
 
04:33:32.510 --> 04:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative Spielberg
 
04:33:35.390 --> 04:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
so our agenda for Wednesday includes
 
04:33:37.990 --> 04:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
executive session on the cannabis bill
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
keep in mind whenever we know we're
 
04:33:41.689 --> 04:33:41.699 align:start position:0%
gonna have an exact session I try to
 
04:33:44.209 --> 04:33:44.219 align:start position:0%
list as many things as possible so if
 
04:33:46.490 --> 04:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
we're ready we can do it I wasn't sure
 
04:33:48.410 --> 04:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
just trying to get to know what you
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
think we will be yeah I I wasn't sure
 
04:33:52.369 --> 04:33:52.379 align:start position:0%
how the committee would feel about the
 
04:33:52.379 --> 04:33:53.390 align:start position:0%
how the committee would feel about the
bill

04:33:53.390 --> 04:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:33:55.910 --> 04:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
um and it to me it's very apparent that
 
04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
we need a work session on that bill
 
04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
because we didn't even hear from any of
 
04:34:01.369 --> 04:34:01.379 align:start position:0%
the agencies that are impacted by it so
 
04:34:03.289 --> 04:34:03.299 align:start position:0%
uh we will schedule a work session on
 
04:34:05.929 --> 04:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
that so we will not exec six things am I
 
04:34:08.029 --> 04:34:08.039 align:start position:0%
correct that we have until March 30th to
 
04:34:09.890 --> 04:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
get out a second I believe so because of
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
the second committee so work session
 
04:34:14.150 --> 04:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
that includes a good robust discussion
 
04:34:16.010 --> 04:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
after we hear from the agencies that
 
04:34:17.510 --> 04:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
would be great it would be yeah be part
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
of that whole thing to be go through
 
04:34:19.199 --> 04:34:20.090 align:start position:0%
of that whole thing to be go through
that

04:34:20.090 --> 04:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:22.429 --> 04:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
um it's obviously a big bill
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
um but if we try to keep focused on our
 
04:34:24.719 --> 04:34:25.910 align:start position:0%
um but if we try to keep focused on our
piece

04:34:25.910 --> 04:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
piece
 
04:34:27.230 --> 04:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
um but still there's still a lot to
 
04:34:29.990 --> 04:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
think about there uh so yeah I and what
 
04:34:31.551 --> 04:34:31.561 align:start position:0%
I don't know is when we can schedule
 
04:34:34.250 --> 04:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
that work session because we don't know
 
04:34:36.650 --> 04:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be here next week in
 
04:34:40.789 --> 04:34:40.799 align:start position:0%
session for two days or three days so I
 
04:34:43.310 --> 04:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
don't know how much you can do here but
 
04:34:47.209 --> 04:34:47.219 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead so I just procedurally I
 
04:34:48.650 --> 04:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:34:50.990 --> 04:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
um what happens when we're the second
 
04:34:53.170 --> 04:34:53.180 align:start position:0%
committee to get a bill
 
04:34:56.449 --> 04:34:56.459 align:start position:0%
and when we were the first committee we
 
04:34:58.551 --> 04:34:58.561 align:start position:0%
retained a whole bunch of those can we
 
04:35:01.131 --> 04:35:01.141 align:start position:0%
retain something when we're we get it as
 
04:35:02.990 --> 04:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
a second coming that is an appropriate
 
04:35:04.789 --> 04:35:04.799 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you that is option
 
04:35:06.289 --> 04:35:06.299 align:start position:0%
that's always an option for any Bill
 
04:35:07.730 --> 04:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
same with the one we just heard yeah
 
04:35:09.650 --> 04:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
it's an option
 
04:35:12.289 --> 04:35:12.299 align:start position:0%
um or we may we'll have to see where the
 
04:35:14.570 --> 04:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
room goes after we have I think we I
 
04:35:15.709 --> 04:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
think on that one it sounded like we
 
04:35:17.631 --> 04:35:17.641 align:start position:0%
needed a work session I wasn't sure if
 
04:35:19.250 --> 04:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
we did or not but it sounds like we
 
04:35:20.949 --> 04:35:20.959 align:start position:0%
absolutely do yeah
 
04:35:23.449 --> 04:35:23.459 align:start position:0%
so so right now just you know what I'm
 
04:35:26.570 --> 04:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
thinking is well we have to do an exec
 
04:35:28.609 --> 04:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
session on Wednesday we must do that
 
04:35:31.609 --> 04:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
right now it's scheduled for 11.
 
04:35:34.250 --> 04:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
please contact me if you think 11 is
 
04:35:36.051 --> 04:35:36.061 align:start position:0%
going to be a huge hardship for you
 
04:35:38.570 --> 04:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
because what I can do is come in open
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
the exact session and then immediately
 
04:35:43.490 --> 04:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh recess it until we think we can get
 
04:35:45.890 --> 04:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
people here so if it's if representative
 
04:35:48.109 --> 04:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
spilsbury gets 18 inches and can't get
 
04:35:51.709 --> 04:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
here till noon maybe we can just but but
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
we have to do it and I need you here so
 
04:35:56.810 --> 04:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to be a little flexible but
 
04:35:58.189 --> 04:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
we got to get it done because then we
 
04:36:00.590 --> 04:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
got session at 9am the following day so
 
04:36:02.570 --> 04:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
just be aware of that and then for
 
04:36:04.670 --> 04:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
whatever happens at the exact session on
 
04:36:07.010 --> 04:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
Wednesday of course please be
 
04:36:11.209 --> 04:36:11.219 align:start position:0%
pre-prepared with what a committee uh
 
04:36:13.070 --> 04:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
report might look like at least sketch
 
04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
something out so that we're not you know
 
04:36:17.631 --> 04:36:17.641 align:start position:0%
here till midnight huh right represent
 
04:36:27.470 --> 04:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:29.810 --> 04:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just on the on the cannabis
 
04:36:29.820 --> 04:36:30.890 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just on the on the cannabis
bill

04:36:30.890 --> 04:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:36:30.900 --> 04:36:34.670 align:start position:0%
bill
um

04:36:34.670 --> 04:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:37.609 --> 04:36:37.619 align:start position:0%
I think you know we may divide in One
 
04:36:40.730 --> 04:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
Direction or another uh who knows
 
04:36:42.709 --> 04:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
um but it's really complicated and
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
they're clearly uh some technical issues
 
04:36:46.849 --> 04:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
with the bill
 
04:36:50.090 --> 04:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
so I think it behooves all of us that
 
04:36:51.470 --> 04:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
are interested in maybe getting
 
04:36:53.090 --> 04:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
something done
 
04:36:55.010 --> 04:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
04:36:58.131 --> 04:36:58.141 align:start position:0%
get a handle on those technical changes
 
04:37:00.289 --> 04:37:00.299 align:start position:0%
you know there are mistakes in the bill
 
04:37:00.299 --> 04:37:01.310 align:start position:0%
you know there are mistakes in the bill
we

04:37:01.310 --> 04:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:37:03.349 --> 04:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
got a list of them today from various
 
04:37:05.990 --> 04:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
people actually and they're not not
 
04:37:09.730 --> 04:37:09.740 align:start position:0%
because of the choice between 15 and
 
04:37:12.349 --> 04:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
a half percent there just because there
 
04:37:15.109 --> 04:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
are mistakes partly in the shift from
 
04:37:17.929 --> 04:37:17.939 align:start position:0%
the 15a from the eight and a half to the
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
15 I think there were mistakes made but
 
04:37:23.869 --> 04:37:23.879 align:start position:0%
uh so so I'm just
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
flagging that we've got a job in our
 
04:37:30.051 --> 04:37:30.061 align:start position:0%
hands no matter which way we go
 
04:37:34.609 --> 04:37:34.619 align:start position:0%
on the big issues to get a
 
04:37:37.070 --> 04:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
a bill that's
 
04:37:40.250 --> 04:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
at least fixes the mistakes and goes
 
04:37:42.170 --> 04:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
forward on one front or another or it
 
04:37:43.849 --> 04:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
goes forward with a divide I don't know
 
04:37:45.949 --> 04:37:45.959 align:start position:0%
and that's a very good point because
 
04:37:47.510 --> 04:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
there there are some we you know there's
 
04:37:50.810 --> 04:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
some wording issues and syntax issues uh
 
04:37:53.330 --> 04:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
we have our rep our committee researcher
 
04:37:53.340 --> 04:37:55.010 align:start position:0%
we have our rep our committee researcher
here

04:37:55.010 --> 04:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:37:56.869 --> 04:37:56.879 align:start position:0%
the interestingly the liquor
 
04:37:59.209 --> 04:37:59.219 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who were here did not even
 
04:38:01.131 --> 04:38:01.141 align:start position:0%
give us a pink card it's like they
 
04:38:03.289 --> 04:38:03.299 align:start position:0%
didn't want to testify but would they be
 
04:38:06.349 --> 04:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
able to do that deep dive amongst them I
 
04:38:08.510 --> 04:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
mean in their in their agency to do the
 
04:38:11.869 --> 04:38:11.879 align:start position:0%
Deep dive and help us identify and the
 
04:38:14.209 --> 04:38:14.219 align:start position:0%
fixes that are necessary do they have
 
04:38:17.209 --> 04:38:17.219 align:start position:0%
that capacity
 
04:38:17.219 --> 04:38:22.269 align:start position:0%
that capacity
well

04:38:22.269 --> 04:38:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:24.709 --> 04:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that's the right agency
 
04:38:33.109 --> 04:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:36.051 --> 04:38:36.061 align:start position:0%
side by side of the original bill
 
04:38:38.090 --> 04:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
and the bill that came out of the
 
04:38:38.100 --> 04:38:41.449 align:start position:0%
and the bill that came out of the
committee

04:38:41.449 --> 04:38:41.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:43.310 --> 04:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
I was just going to suggest the same
 
04:38:46.670 --> 04:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
thing but I would make it a three column
 
04:38:50.689 --> 04:38:50.699 align:start position:0%
last year's Bill HP 1598 which had an
 
04:38:52.789 --> 04:38:52.799 align:start position:0%
Enterprise model
 
04:38:55.730 --> 04:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
the bill that was introduced which I
 
04:38:57.289 --> 04:38:57.299 align:start position:0%
have not read but I gathered from this
 
04:38:59.230 --> 04:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
morning follows the meals and rooms
 
04:39:02.269 --> 04:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
retail level tax model
 
04:39:06.051 --> 04:39:06.061 align:start position:0%
and the amended Bill these are three
 
04:39:08.689 --> 04:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
fundamentally different concepts of how
 
04:39:12.769 --> 04:39:12.779 align:start position:0%
to promote and enjoy some of the revenue
 
04:39:14.689 --> 04:39:14.699 align:start position:0%
from the industry that I think that's
 
04:39:16.730 --> 04:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
really where our time and attention
 
04:39:18.289 --> 04:39:18.299 align:start position:0%
needs to focus
 
04:39:20.150 --> 04:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we're going to have the
 
04:39:23.810 --> 04:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
staff available to do that and if this
 
04:39:26.449 --> 04:39:26.459 align:start position:0%
is a topic of great interest to you I
 
04:39:28.131 --> 04:39:28.141 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to do your own Deep
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
dive and go to your own personal experts
 
04:39:32.869 --> 04:39:32.879 align:start position:0%
on this if if representative abrami is
 
04:39:34.730 --> 04:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
someone you consider an expert because
 
04:39:37.010 --> 04:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
he's done the work and the commission
 
04:39:39.050 --> 04:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
I would encourage you to reach out to
 
04:39:41.350 --> 04:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
him and maybe he will come back to us
 
04:39:44.030 --> 04:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
when we do our work session but if
 
04:39:46.070 --> 04:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's other people like that encourage
 
04:39:48.650 --> 04:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
them to help us because I I'm looking at
 
04:39:50.690 --> 04:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
Jennifer and I'm thinking there's only
 
04:39:52.550 --> 04:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
so much we can ask of the staff at this
 
04:39:55.070 --> 04:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
time of the year yes representative is
 
04:39:58.010 --> 04:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
it possible to ask LBA I mean to give to
 
04:40:01.430 --> 04:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
give representative or abrami's
 
04:40:04.130 --> 04:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
you know hand out give that to them and
 
04:40:08.270 --> 04:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
ask LBA not LBA L um legislative
 
04:40:13.250 --> 04:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
Services OLS ask OLS to look at it again
 
04:40:16.670 --> 04:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
I mean they it's a long Bill any anybody
 
04:40:18.230 --> 04:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
working on its you know it's
 
04:40:20.330 --> 04:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
understandable there would be some you
 
04:40:22.730 --> 04:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
know mistakes in it but and they could
 
04:40:46.970 --> 04:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:46.980 --> 04:41:02.208 align:start position:0%
 
enough

04:41:02.208 --> 04:41:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:04.490 --> 04:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure representative ulery
 
04:41:07.490 --> 04:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
weren't limited as to what we can do on
 
04:41:10.430 --> 04:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
the policy in the side by side would
 
04:41:14.930 --> 04:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
show policy changes we're limited to the
 
04:41:17.930 --> 04:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
revenue uh questions
 
04:41:22.610 --> 04:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
so some of the corrections that uh Pat
 
04:41:25.030 --> 04:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
has put in
 
04:41:28.190 --> 04:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
our syntax and and we should correct
 
04:41:31.310 --> 04:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
them and make that and uh perhaps have
 
04:41:34.250 --> 04:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
John as the co-signer on the uh uh
 
04:41:36.050 --> 04:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
Amendment if it's put forward because
 
04:41:39.230 --> 04:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
that would have the input of uh our
 
04:41:40.730 --> 04:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
uh so it would be policy coming from
 
04:41:46.368 --> 04:41:46.378 align:start position:0%
them as a uh the scrivener's note type
 
04:41:49.368 --> 04:41:49.378 align:start position:0%
of uh an amendment that can be taken
 
04:41:52.670 --> 04:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
care of the questions that we're limited
 
04:41:56.750 --> 04:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
to are as to the revenue generation the
 
04:42:01.730 --> 04:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
15 applied at the core or a sales tax
 
04:42:04.368 --> 04:42:04.378 align:start position:0%
would be better uh and then there would
 
04:42:06.948 --> 04:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
have to be a justification for this one
 
04:42:10.670 --> 04:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
or that one uh whichever we come up with
 
04:42:10.680 --> 04:42:11.270 align:start position:0%
or that one uh whichever we come up with
um

04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
I think that may be
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
a division of work assignments that
 
04:42:17.760 --> 04:42:19.310 align:start position:0%
a division of work assignments that
maybe

04:42:19.310 --> 04:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:42:21.948 --> 04:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
beneficial to correcting all of the
 
04:42:24.590 --> 04:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
problems within the bill not stepping on
 
04:42:28.310 --> 04:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
any toes if you will and getting the the
 
04:42:28.320 --> 04:42:30.110 align:start position:0%
any toes if you will and getting the the
thing

04:42:30.110 --> 04:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:42:33.170 --> 04:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
back on the floor even if it has to be a
 
04:42:36.288 --> 04:42:36.298 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment for some of the
 
04:42:39.110 --> 04:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
Crossing of T's and died in your eyes
 
04:42:39.120 --> 04:42:41.628 align:start position:0%
Crossing of T's and died in your eyes
but

04:42:41.628 --> 04:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:42:44.750 --> 04:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm offering that as a suggestion to the
 
04:42:46.730 --> 04:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
committee because we're limited on this
 
04:42:48.948 --> 04:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
bill as to what we can talk about which
 
04:42:48.958 --> 04:42:49.910 align:start position:0%
bill as to what we can talk about which
is

04:42:49.910 --> 04:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:42:49.920 --> 04:42:50.990 align:start position:0%
is
money

04:42:50.990 --> 04:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:42:51.000 --> 04:42:52.730 align:start position:0%
money
not

04:42:52.730 --> 04:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:42:55.788 --> 04:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
Crossing T's and Doty knives but money
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
so I just
 
04:43:04.910 --> 04:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:07.368 --> 04:43:07.378 align:start position:0%
yeah I believe the representative Ames
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
has probably already found all of the
 
04:43:12.830 --> 04:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
editing problems
 
04:43:14.868 --> 04:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
I was talking about it the day after we
 
04:43:17.170 --> 04:43:17.180 align:start position:0%
got the bill
 
04:43:19.788 --> 04:43:19.798 align:start position:0%
but on
 
04:43:24.070 --> 04:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
aside from that on money includes
 
04:43:28.128 --> 04:43:28.138 align:start position:0%
Appropriations yes it does because the
 
04:43:29.628 --> 04:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
finance committee doesn't get to see
 
04:43:31.390 --> 04:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
this yeah
 
04:43:34.970 --> 04:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
and also
 
04:43:34.980 --> 04:43:35.690 align:start position:0%
and also
um

04:43:35.690 --> 04:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
I think it would help if all of us tried
 
04:43:39.120 --> 04:43:40.150 align:start position:0%
I think it would help if all of us tried
to

04:43:40.150 --> 04:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:43:42.650 --> 04:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
segregate out
 
04:43:45.530 --> 04:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
the tax structure versus the
 
04:43:48.830 --> 04:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation side versus any editing
 
04:43:50.510 --> 04:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
things we think somebody might have
 
04:43:54.230 --> 04:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
missed and have them with them whenever
 
04:43:56.448 --> 04:43:56.458 align:start position:0%
we've managed to get to the work session
 
04:43:59.690 --> 04:43:59.700 align:start position:0%
so that we aren't going from one topic
 
04:44:01.550 --> 04:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
to the other forgetting what we just
 
04:44:01.560 --> 04:44:03.530 align:start position:0%
to the other forgetting what we just
said

04:44:03.530 --> 04:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:44:03.540 --> 04:44:05.150 align:start position:0%
said
yeah

04:44:05.150 --> 04:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
it was Ames did you have something else
 
04:44:08.390 --> 04:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
yeah just
 
04:44:11.208 --> 04:44:11.218 align:start position:0%
I I would welcome that uh
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
side by side the two pieces I I agree
 
04:44:17.448 --> 04:44:17.458 align:start position:0%
with you that the bill last year or
 
04:44:19.610 --> 04:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
whenever it was two years ago when last
 
04:44:21.110 --> 04:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
year I guess
 
04:44:21.120 --> 04:44:23.090 align:start position:0%
year I guess
um

04:44:23.090 --> 04:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:26.750 --> 04:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
there was a big policy issue there it
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
was an Enterprise
 
04:44:28.680 --> 04:44:29.810 align:start position:0%
was an Enterprise
model

04:44:29.810 --> 04:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
model
 
04:44:29.820 --> 04:44:32.030 align:start position:0%
model
and

04:44:32.030 --> 04:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:44:34.250 --> 04:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
I think were probably pieces that this
 
04:44:37.430 --> 04:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
year's Bill two versions but the main
 
04:44:39.530 --> 04:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
thing was it was run by The Liquor
 
04:44:41.270 --> 04:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
Commission that's where the debate was
 
04:44:43.730 --> 04:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
that's where we got hung up that's where
 
04:44:46.250 --> 04:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
that's because why it died in the end I
 
04:44:50.750 --> 04:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:53.510 --> 04:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking ahead to a calendar and
 
04:44:56.030 --> 04:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh if we're going to do house session
 
04:44:59.690 --> 04:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
three days next week uh I guess I'm
 
04:45:03.410 --> 04:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
looking at Tuesday the 28th
 
04:45:06.350 --> 04:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
to do work sessions
 
04:45:11.590 --> 04:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:15.590 --> 04:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
and and then we can also list exec
 
04:45:17.330 --> 04:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
session that day if already great but
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
then listing an exact session the
 
04:45:22.010 --> 04:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
following day the 29th
 
04:45:24.170 --> 04:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
um and hopefully get it done on the 29th
 
04:45:26.390 --> 04:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
but that would give us two days yes
 
04:45:30.170 --> 04:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:31.850 --> 04:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
I didn't bring my calendar with me but
 
04:45:34.250 --> 04:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure the 28th is a day that I
 
04:45:36.948 --> 04:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
sent you an email about
 
04:45:39.170 --> 04:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
you remember I had
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:54.230 --> 04:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
yep that is the day
 
04:45:55.788 --> 04:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
well we're kind of the only thing is
 
04:45:58.310 --> 04:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
we're kind of getting shy on time
 
04:45:58.320 --> 04:46:00.110 align:start position:0%
we're kind of getting shy on time
um

04:46:00.110 --> 04:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:01.730 --> 04:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine you guys would want to
 
04:46:05.150 --> 04:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:17.510 --> 04:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:19.490 --> 04:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
right do you mean Friday this week or
 
04:46:22.190 --> 04:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
Friday next week we can't do it this
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
Friday because we wouldn't have time to
 
04:46:26.570 --> 04:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:28.670 --> 04:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
um but even next week I don't know about
 
04:46:30.350 --> 04:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
you but those long house session days
 
04:46:32.810 --> 04:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
are exhausting I don't know if I could
 
04:46:35.150 --> 04:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
do another day after that no so what
 
04:46:42.890 --> 04:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:46.250 --> 04:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry I end up loss now
 
04:46:47.628 --> 04:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
um so we could potentially do a work
 
04:46:51.050 --> 04:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
session on Monday March 27th
 
04:46:55.250 --> 04:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
particularly focusing on House Bill 639
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
we can organize ourselves hopefully to
 
04:46:59.930 --> 04:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
talk about it in the I think there's
 
04:47:01.430 --> 04:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
three or four different segments that
 
04:47:03.050 --> 04:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
were just mentioned one what are the
 
04:47:05.270 --> 04:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
scrivener errors we've got to fix two
 
04:47:08.150 --> 04:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
what's the tax rate three what what are
 
04:47:10.430 --> 04:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
we taxing for where's the money going
 
04:47:12.530 --> 04:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
right are those four categories we're
 
04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
focusing on
 
04:47:16.128 --> 04:47:16.138 align:start position:0%
and you know kind of address those one
 
04:47:18.288 --> 04:47:18.298 align:start position:0%
by one having the agencies here to help
 
04:47:18.298 --> 04:47:19.490 align:start position:0%
by one having the agencies here to help
us

04:47:19.490 --> 04:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:47:21.948 --> 04:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
work through that and any other experts
 
04:47:24.770 --> 04:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
you would think would be necessary so so
 
04:47:27.650 --> 04:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
another thought in terms of like the
 
04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
just the I guess you're calling them
 
04:47:31.970 --> 04:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
Scribner areas just what they use the
 
04:47:34.490 --> 04:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
wrong word or something the wrong tense
 
04:47:37.550 --> 04:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
or grammatic or they put it in the wrong
 
04:47:40.368 --> 04:47:40.378 align:start position:0%
place like one was labeled a c and it
 
04:47:42.948 --> 04:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
should have been a b yeah so I think I I
 
04:47:44.750 --> 04:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
think it's important but I don't think
 
04:47:46.010 --> 04:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
we should
 
04:47:48.830 --> 04:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
I don't even maybe at the end if we have
 
04:47:50.750 --> 04:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
nothing else to do I just think we ought
 
04:47:52.550 --> 04:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
to focus on the other two pieces because
 
04:48:10.250 --> 04:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:12.288 --> 04:48:12.298 align:start position:0%
yeah some people are very very good at
 
04:48:14.570 --> 04:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
that and if you are please do that on
 
04:48:17.330 --> 04:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
all these bills be you know another
 
04:48:19.010 --> 04:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
element that I think we talked about too
 
04:48:20.448 --> 04:48:20.458 align:start position:0%
is the whole
 
04:48:22.910 --> 04:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
rule making and the fees where the fees
 
04:48:24.948 --> 04:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
coming from so that's another topic we
 
04:48:27.288 --> 04:48:27.298 align:start position:0%
really have to focus on you know what
 
04:48:30.650 --> 04:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
level of fee is appropriate so if we
 
04:48:31.970 --> 04:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
could kind of do it in those categories
 
04:48:34.128 --> 04:48:34.138 align:start position:0%
at least I think that'd be helpful your
 
04:48:34.138 --> 04:48:53.330 align:start position:0%
at least I think that'd be helpful your
thoughts

04:48:53.330 --> 04:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:55.850 --> 04:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
representative I I don't think we
 
04:48:58.788 --> 04:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
explored next Monday what I'm recalling
 
04:49:03.650 --> 04:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
from HP 1598 is there was a series of
 
04:49:05.810 --> 04:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
complex amendments
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
um discussed proposed and considered
 
04:49:11.930 --> 04:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
I don't see any realistic opportunity to
 
04:49:14.208 --> 04:49:14.218 align:start position:0%
get into that kind of dynamic if we're
 
04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
meeting two consecutive days at the end
 
04:49:19.368 --> 04:49:19.378 align:start position:0%
if we're meeting the you know the 27th
 
04:49:21.410 --> 04:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
and 28th there's no way we're going to
 
04:49:23.090 --> 04:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
be able to turn amendments around we'll
 
04:49:25.010 --> 04:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
probably end up retaining it if that's
 
04:49:27.770 --> 04:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh the calendar we follow so what about
 
04:49:30.288 --> 04:49:30.298 align:start position:0%
the next two Mondays it gives you a week
 
04:49:34.070 --> 04:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
between sessions to try and refashion
 
04:49:35.570 --> 04:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
what you think the solution for
 
04:49:42.948 --> 04:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.770 --> 04:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
we have this done in time for to go to
 
04:49:47.990 --> 04:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
the floor again we voted on which is
 
04:49:49.788 --> 04:49:49.798 align:start position:0%
actually happened
 
04:49:51.948 --> 04:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
yes as long as we get it done
 
04:49:54.410 --> 04:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
um you know March 30th is our absolute
 
04:49:56.628 --> 04:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
deadline but March 29th because we're
 
04:49:58.430 --> 04:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to have everything done to
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
the clerk and so forth so that's why I'm
 
04:50:03.530 --> 04:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
trying to get there we do need to push
 
04:50:05.030 --> 04:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
it along but I also I'm just trying to
 
04:50:06.590 --> 04:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
be a little sensitive to the fact that
 
04:50:09.288 --> 04:50:09.298 align:start position:0%
next week could be really tough
 
04:50:16.128 --> 04:50:16.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:19.750 --> 04:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
for them to do amendments
 
04:50:26.930 --> 04:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:45.530 --> 04:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:47.570 --> 04:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
no I don't think there are any because
 
04:50:50.208 --> 04:50:50.218 align:start position:0%
of the deadline is being that weak right
 
04:50:50.218 --> 04:50:51.170 align:start position:0%
of the deadline is being that weak right
yeah

04:50:51.170 --> 04:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:50:52.850 --> 04:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
would the other important deadline we
 
04:50:56.510 --> 04:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
have is next week that's why it could be
 
04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
the Tuesday Wednesday Thursday thing
 
04:51:00.230 --> 04:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit challenging let me see
 
04:51:01.490 --> 04:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
if I can get a little bit more
 
04:51:04.550 --> 04:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
information from the speaker on what he
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
thinks about next Tuesday I certainly
 
04:51:09.050 --> 04:51:09.060 align:start position:0%
don't mind meeting next week but if
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to be here three long days
 
04:51:13.368 --> 04:51:13.378 align:start position:0%
of session I just want to you to be
 
04:51:15.708 --> 04:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
aware of that if we're not going to have
 
04:51:18.050 --> 04:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
session on Tuesday then maybe we do want
 
04:51:20.208 --> 04:51:20.218 align:start position:0%
to come in Monday or Tuesday for half a
 
04:51:23.390 --> 04:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
day and start percolating deep and
 
04:51:25.730 --> 04:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
getting a deeper dive on this
 
04:51:27.530 --> 04:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
um because I'm not you know I think it's
 
04:51:29.208 --> 04:51:29.218 align:start position:0%
a great idea because we might need some
 
04:51:30.890 --> 04:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
more time for if these amendments are
 
04:51:30.900 --> 04:51:33.110 align:start position:0%
more time for if these amendments are
big

04:51:33.110 --> 04:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:34.788 --> 04:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
but I just don't want to overwhelm us
 
04:51:36.650 --> 04:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
that's all so let me see if I can find
 
04:51:36.660 --> 04:51:41.270 align:start position:0%
that's all so let me see if I can find
out

04:51:41.270 --> 04:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:42.770 --> 04:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
well we're talking about both of them
 
04:51:44.448 --> 04:51:44.458 align:start position:0%
but so there's a chance that we'll have
 
04:51:50.390 --> 04:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:52.490 --> 04:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
and Wednesday we're definitely having it
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
right so let me see if I can find out
 
04:52:00.650 --> 04:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
more and then you know I've got your
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
input and your ideas we'd all know the
 
04:52:03.948 --> 04:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
types of categories we need to really
 
04:52:05.390 --> 04:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
drill out and I'm going to reread the
 
04:52:07.010 --> 04:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
bill based on now I'm thinking more
 
04:52:08.868 --> 04:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
clearly on it hopefully all of us will
 
04:52:12.470 --> 04:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
be able to do that representative Ulrich
 
04:52:14.448 --> 04:52:14.458 align:start position:0%
yeah it's my understanding that uh
 
04:52:17.390 --> 04:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
Tuesday is going to be the Overflow
 
04:52:20.810 --> 04:52:20.820 align:start position:0%
plan on Thursdays being a long day just
 
04:52:23.270 --> 04:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
because and that gets filled up it's
 
04:52:26.270 --> 04:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
going to overflow backwards onto
 
04:52:26.280 --> 04:52:27.170 align:start position:0%
going to overflow backwards onto
Wednesday

04:52:27.170 --> 04:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
04:52:29.990 --> 04:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
and if Wednesday becomes a long day it's
 
04:52:33.410 --> 04:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
going to overflow backwards on Tuesday
 
04:52:35.770 --> 04:52:35.780 align:start position:0%
so it's not Tuesday's not the first day
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
Thursday's the first day and it backs up
 
04:52:43.310 --> 04:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
that's the way that the
 
04:52:46.128 --> 04:52:46.138 align:start position:0%
leadership is said it's going to go at
 
04:52:47.868 --> 04:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
least that's my understanding
 
04:52:54.530 --> 04:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:56.570 --> 04:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
so we I don't have any
 
04:52:58.550 --> 04:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
decisions quite yet we'll have to see if
 
04:52:59.708 --> 04:52:59.718 align:start position:0%
we can get a little bit more information
 
04:53:02.510 --> 04:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay good and we'll we'll communicate as
 
04:53:05.030 --> 04:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
best we can and uh I will definitely see
 
04:53:07.070 --> 04:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
all of you on Wednesday
 
04:53:09.350 --> 04:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
and if you think you know that morning
 
04:53:11.030 --> 04:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to be a little late or
 
04:53:13.070 --> 04:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
something let me know as soon as
 
04:53:14.930 --> 04:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
possible yeah
 
04:53:17.810 --> 04:53:17.820 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair a question that
 
04:53:20.030 --> 04:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
my mind I'm just wondering where the
 
04:53:22.910 --> 04:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
room's at with this cannabis tax
 
04:53:22.920 --> 04:53:24.288 align:start position:0%
room's at with this cannabis tax
and

04:53:24.288 --> 04:53:24.298 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:53:26.690 --> 04:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
if people would prefer if the room
 
04:53:29.170 --> 04:53:29.180 align:start position:0%
prefers the 15
 
04:53:31.128 --> 04:53:31.138 align:start position:0%
farmer tax
 
04:53:33.650 --> 04:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms tax at eight and a
 
04:53:37.850 --> 04:53:37.860 align:start position:0%
half percent or the tobacco stamp tax
 
04:53:39.470 --> 04:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
I mean it doesn't sound like they
 
04:53:41.090 --> 04:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
considered that so I'm just kind of
 
04:53:43.190 --> 04:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
curious where the room's at
 
04:53:46.550 --> 04:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
so when I'm looking at this stuff
 
04:53:48.650 --> 04:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
before I go to sleep tomorrow night or
 
04:53:51.288 --> 04:53:51.298 align:start position:0%
tonight personally I am not prepared at
 
04:53:53.510 --> 04:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
all to answer that question I didn't
 
04:53:55.310 --> 04:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
think you were but I thought maybe more
 
04:53:56.570 --> 04:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
of this but maybe other people want to
 
04:53:59.628 --> 04:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
comment representative only yeah I think
 
04:54:05.090 --> 04:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
that I want to look at a version of the
 
04:54:06.470 --> 04:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax
 
04:54:11.448 --> 04:54:11.458 align:start position:0%
we did a separate Vape tax thing and it
 
04:54:14.030 --> 04:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
was put in very low because the Senate
 
04:54:15.890 --> 04:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
insisted on it
 
04:54:19.430 --> 04:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
produces practically no Revenue but um
 
04:54:22.990 --> 04:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
we did do that and it's
 
04:54:23.000 --> 04:54:24.650 align:start position:0%
we did do that and it's
enforced

04:54:24.650 --> 04:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
04:54:28.368 --> 04:54:28.378 align:start position:0%
by The Liquor Commission
 
04:54:28.378 --> 04:54:29.990 align:start position:0%
by The Liquor Commission
and

04:54:29.990 --> 04:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:54:32.208 --> 04:54:32.218 align:start position:0%
um I think it could be in a good
 
04:54:35.570 --> 04:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
alternative if we're looking at
 
04:54:39.410 --> 04:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
some kind of a tax that's got several
 
04:54:41.448 --> 04:54:41.458 align:start position:0%
levels to it and
 
04:54:47.208 --> 04:54:47.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative Spielberg
 
04:54:53.090 --> 04:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
I I think that the closer we look
 
04:54:56.690 --> 04:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
at the concept of taxing the ingredient
 
04:54:59.810 --> 04:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
the raw material at the cultivation end
 
04:55:02.990 --> 04:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
the more problematic it's going to be
 
04:55:06.948 --> 04:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
and I I've been turning over in my mind
 
04:55:10.550 --> 04:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
the timber analogy as well since I had
 
04:55:13.490 --> 04:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
missed that one and uh you know I think
 
04:55:15.170 --> 04:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
this is very different you're talking
 
04:55:15.180 --> 04:55:16.270 align:start position:0%
this is very different you're talking
about

04:55:16.270 --> 04:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:55:18.470 --> 04:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
trying to tax something that's an
 
04:55:20.570 --> 04:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
ingredient that gets fashioned into many
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
different final forms I think we would
 
04:55:24.530 --> 04:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
be far better off to look at a lower
 
04:55:27.470 --> 04:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
rate on a final product and then all
 
04:55:29.090 --> 04:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
those variables
 
04:56:26.570 --> 04:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:29.030 --> 04:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
yes I agree we've done a lot of work
 
04:56:31.310 --> 04:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
done on doing it at a wholesale level
 
04:56:34.070 --> 04:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of buy-in on that but uh
 
04:56:36.708 --> 04:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about the 15 rate
 
04:56:39.230 --> 04:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
other states have imposed taxes and fees
 
04:56:40.670 --> 04:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
and made it legal but they had so many
 
04:56:42.830 --> 04:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
taxes and fees that the illegal Market
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
hasn't gone away
 
04:56:46.730 --> 04:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
and so I want to make it low enough
 
04:56:48.708 --> 04:56:48.718 align:start position:0%
so that the illegal Market does go away
 
04:56:50.690 --> 04:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
and we have people shopping from Maine
 
04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts into Vermont into New
 
04:56:55.190 --> 04:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like we do with liquor and
 
04:56:56.690 --> 04:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
that we might wind up with more Revenue
 
04:56:58.850 --> 04:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
with a lower rate so I was thinking
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:10.550 --> 04:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:14.270 --> 04:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
so so I was thinking so at first as the
 
04:57:16.070 --> 04:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
discussion went on we heard from more
 
04:57:19.850 --> 04:57:19.860 align:start position:0%
people I was in hearing particularly and
 
04:57:21.948 --> 04:57:21.958 align:start position:0%
agreeing that sooner or later there's
 
04:57:24.530 --> 04:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
going to be interstate commerce that we
 
04:57:26.448 --> 04:57:26.458 align:start position:0%
needed to move something to the retail
 
04:57:30.230 --> 04:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
level but one of the things I don't know
 
04:57:33.410 --> 04:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
is I don't know we haven't heard anybody
 
04:57:36.170 --> 04:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
talk about controlling the product like
 
04:57:38.448 --> 04:57:38.458 align:start position:0%
along the path you know from the
 
04:57:41.570 --> 04:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
cultivator to the top so maybe there
 
04:57:45.230 --> 04:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
would be a need to track
 
04:57:48.050 --> 04:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
what is cultivated here in New Hampshire
 
04:57:51.170 --> 04:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
and goes up to up the next level and so
 
04:57:53.270 --> 04:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
if you're going to do that and it needs
 
04:57:54.590 --> 04:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:57:58.128 --> 04:57:58.138 align:start position:0%
you know some kind of
 
04:58:00.650 --> 04:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
stamp put on it that you know we've
 
04:58:02.510 --> 04:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
looked at this and we acknowledge that
 
04:58:05.690 --> 04:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
this batch is going somewhere maybe a
 
04:58:08.750 --> 04:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
very small fee or something just mostly
 
04:58:08.760 --> 04:58:10.250 align:start position:0%
very small fee or something just mostly
it's

04:58:10.250 --> 04:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:58:12.230 --> 04:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like the mushrooms the
 
04:58:13.730 --> 04:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
mushrooms the wild mushrooms when
 
04:58:17.150 --> 04:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
they're harvested they need to have a
 
04:58:20.270 --> 04:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
code on them that will tell you where it
 
04:58:22.550 --> 04:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
was harvested in by whom it was
 
04:58:25.368 --> 04:58:25.378 align:start position:0%
harvested so there might be like some
 
04:58:27.948 --> 04:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
kind of small processing fee to go to
 
04:58:30.410 --> 04:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
that so I don't just want to ripe wipe
 
04:58:33.650 --> 04:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
it off the books if we need it first for
 
04:58:36.110 --> 04:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
chat tracking to make sure that the
 
04:58:38.390 --> 04:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
product is safe
 
04:58:41.510 --> 04:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
but overall I think it we mostly need to
 
04:58:49.070 --> 04:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:50.690 --> 04:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
the person Bolton did you have something
 
04:58:53.090 --> 04:58:53.100 align:start position:0%
else yeah well since we're talking about
 
04:58:57.650 --> 04:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
this and um and regarding the 15 fee I
 
04:58:59.690 --> 04:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
don't think that's that's bad uh
 
04:59:01.670 --> 04:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
considering the other states they
 
04:59:04.310 --> 04:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
started out with like six or eight uh
 
04:59:06.288 --> 04:59:06.298 align:start position:0%
for you know like a wholesale and then
 
04:59:08.750 --> 04:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
10 or 12 for extra you know exercise I
 
04:59:11.690 --> 04:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
mean it just kept on going up so 15 on
 
04:59:14.030 --> 04:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
the wholesale basis does doesn't seem
 
04:59:15.530 --> 04:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
that bad to me
 
04:59:20.750 --> 04:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
but and again in anticipation of a
 
04:59:23.208 --> 04:59:23.218 align:start position:0%
worldwide Market or at least uh United
 
04:59:25.610 --> 04:59:25.620 align:start position:0%
States Market that should be considered
 
04:59:28.550 --> 04:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
in the future I believe like it's too
 
04:59:31.610 --> 04:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
much to think about at this point but
 
04:59:34.490 --> 04:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
yes representative Malloy
 
04:59:36.530 --> 04:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
so I know we're trying to talk about
 
04:59:38.810 --> 04:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
Revenue here how much leeway do we have
 
04:59:41.390 --> 04:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
for in the bill that's now in front of
 
04:59:44.810 --> 04:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
us to change the model to another to go
 
04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
to retail I mean this is policy or
 
04:59:51.350 --> 04:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue I I'm I'm getting a little
 
04:59:52.970 --> 04:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
confused here
 
04:59:55.070 --> 04:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
I I just and we don't have to deal with
 
04:59:57.110 --> 04:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
that today but I just don't know what is
 
05:00:00.708 --> 05:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
policy now and what is revenue and and
 
05:00:04.430 --> 05:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
how much we affect that
 
05:00:07.490 --> 05:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
in this committee that's my I'm foggy
 
05:00:07.500 --> 05:00:08.868 align:start position:0%
in this committee that's my I'm foggy
here

05:00:08.868 --> 05:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:00:14.510 --> 05:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:17.330 --> 05:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
the bill deals with
 
05:00:17.340 --> 05:00:18.890 align:start position:0%
the bill deals with
with

05:00:18.890 --> 05:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:00:22.730 --> 05:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
um the Regis the registration of
 
05:00:25.910 --> 05:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
retailers and the an enforcement that's
 
05:00:27.410 --> 05:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
what the Liquor Commission is there for
 
05:00:30.708 --> 05:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
the enforcement on retailers is more
 
05:00:32.270 --> 05:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
what they've been thinking of and
 
05:00:35.288 --> 05:00:35.298 align:start position:0%
forgetting the difficulty of of
 
05:00:38.150 --> 05:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
enforcing on cultivators
 
05:00:41.810 --> 05:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
when they are outside uh
 
05:00:41.820 --> 05:00:43.368 align:start position:0%
when they are outside uh
but

05:00:43.368 --> 05:00:43.378 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:00:43.378 --> 05:00:44.750 align:start position:0%
but
um so

05:00:44.750 --> 05:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:00:48.650 --> 05:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
so putting the tax over at where it was
 
05:00:51.230 --> 05:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
in the beginning at the retail level
 
05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh isn't really a change in their policy
 
05:00:57.650 --> 05:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:59.868 --> 05:00:59.878 align:start position:0%
they changed our policy why can't we
 
05:01:02.690 --> 05:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
change in your back
 
05:01:05.150 --> 05:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
that the other kind of answer to that is
 
05:01:05.160 --> 05:01:06.288 align:start position:0%
that the other kind of answer to that is
that

05:01:06.288 --> 05:01:06.298 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:01:09.230 --> 05:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
tax policy is definitely in our Realm
 
05:01:13.250 --> 05:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
and whether it's a wholesale base or
 
05:01:13.260 --> 05:01:14.750 align:start position:0%
and whether it's a wholesale base or
retail

05:01:14.750 --> 05:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
retail
 
05:01:17.570 --> 05:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
taxes something we're entitled to make
 
05:01:19.550 --> 05:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
choices on that as far as I'm concerned
 
05:01:22.788 --> 05:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and I if I can jump in I would
 
05:01:25.490 --> 05:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
think that a retail base what about the
 
05:01:25.500 --> 05:01:26.750 align:start position:0%
think that a retail base what about the
distributors

05:01:26.750 --> 05:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
distributors
 
05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
I mean if it gets taxed at the
 
05:01:30.590 --> 05:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
distributor level
 
05:01:33.050 --> 05:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
The Next Step I understand is the retail
 
05:01:36.050 --> 05:01:36.060 align:start position:0%
level if we tax it at the distributor
 
05:01:36.060 --> 05:01:37.250 align:start position:0%
level if we tax it at the distributor
level

05:01:37.250 --> 05:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:01:39.590 --> 05:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that cover all the bases would
 
05:01:41.208 --> 05:01:41.218 align:start position:0%
avoid cheating
 
05:01:44.090 --> 05:01:44.100 align:start position:0%
we can determine what the impact is on
 
05:01:46.850 --> 05:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
the market that currently exists I don't
 
05:01:46.860 --> 05:01:47.570 align:start position:0%
the market that currently exists I don't
know

05:01:47.570 --> 05:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:01:51.708 --> 05:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
that sounds like that tracks more of the
 
05:01:52.970 --> 05:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
um gas tax
 
05:01:55.910 --> 05:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
and the tobacco tanks yes I think that's
 
05:01:58.850 --> 05:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:58.860 --> 05:02:01.070 align:start position:0%
 
but

05:02:01.070 --> 05:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:02:04.550 --> 05:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
but one one consideration for what you
 
05:02:06.470 --> 05:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
just said though is we heard about that
 
05:02:09.350 --> 05:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
vertical in integration that they can't
 
05:02:12.170 --> 05:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
if it's one company doing all of it
 
05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
right from the seed right up to the
 
05:02:17.030 --> 05:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
retail where do they put the cut line
 
05:02:20.570 --> 05:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
you know if you wanted you know
 
05:02:24.050 --> 05:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
if if you're trying to tax the
 
05:02:26.690 --> 05:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
distributor they're all of those things
 
05:02:28.310 --> 05:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
so where do you
 
05:02:30.948 --> 05:02:30.958 align:start position:0%
want to make this so I think that that
 
05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
and that that was a question that I had
 
05:02:34.368 --> 05:02:34.378 align:start position:0%
and I one that I think that if you're
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated and you're selling
 
05:02:38.510 --> 05:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis from one entity to the other
 
05:02:40.250 --> 05:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
for a dollar
 
05:02:42.590 --> 05:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
right so you're if you charge it for a
 
05:02:44.208 --> 05:02:44.218 align:start position:0%
dollar then you're gonna get 15 of the
 
05:02:46.430 --> 05:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
dollar but then you got to realize that
 
05:02:48.410 --> 05:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
that retail is going to make
 
05:02:50.810 --> 05:02:50.820 align:start position:0%
an enormous amount of profit on
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
something they bought for a dollar so
 
05:02:54.350 --> 05:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
we're gonna the state will not lose out
 
05:02:56.030 --> 05:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
because we're going to get it and I
 
05:02:57.288 --> 05:02:57.298 align:start position:0%
don't know the numbers I mean it but
 
05:02:57.298 --> 05:02:59.030 align:start position:0%
don't know the numbers I mean it but
integration

05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
integration
 
05:03:01.250 --> 05:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
the vertical integration says it's all
 
05:03:04.010 --> 05:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
one company one company puts the seed in
 
05:03:07.850 --> 05:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
the ground grows it dries it they're all
 
05:03:09.470 --> 05:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
owned by the same company but you're
 
05:03:10.910 --> 05:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
going to have corporate divisions of
 
05:03:14.208 --> 05:03:14.218 align:start position:0%
each of each thing why
 
05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
well for one there'd be that licensing
 
05:03:17.280 --> 05:03:18.948 align:start position:0%
well for one there'd be that licensing
component

05:03:18.948 --> 05:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
component
 
05:03:21.890 --> 05:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
well it's one company well it's like CBS
 
05:03:26.208 --> 05:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
CBS owns the pharmacy they own the PBM
 
05:03:28.730 --> 05:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
they own the insurer
 
05:03:30.230 --> 05:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
but they're all three different
 
05:03:30.240 --> 05:03:31.550 align:start position:0%
but they're all three different
companies

05:03:31.550 --> 05:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
companies
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
and they all are taxed
 
05:03:35.690 --> 05:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
separately well there's a variety of
 
05:03:38.150 --> 05:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
taxes so CVS actually doesn't make a
 
05:03:39.410 --> 05:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
difference whether they're separately
 
05:03:41.208 --> 05:03:41.218 align:start position:0%
incorporated or a single corporate
 
05:03:43.190 --> 05:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
entity that's that's beside the point
 
05:03:46.070 --> 05:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
the real question is from point to point
 
05:03:47.868 --> 05:03:47.878 align:start position:0%
what's the transfer pricing mechanism
 
05:03:49.310 --> 05:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
and this is the question that
 
05:03:55.208 --> 05:03:55.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:58.910 --> 05:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
if the settlement of the committee is to
 
05:04:01.250 --> 05:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
move it to a distributor level which
 
05:04:03.070 --> 05:04:03.080 align:start position:0%
would protect us partially about future
 
05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
Federal uh legalization and cross-border
 
05:04:09.470 --> 05:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
things into the distributed level the
 
05:04:12.050 --> 05:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
rate has to come down because it's being
 
05:04:14.510 --> 05:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
applied to a sale
 
05:04:17.090 --> 05:04:17.100 align:start position:0%
price of a distributor rather than a
 
05:04:21.050 --> 05:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
wholesaler so so no more than eight
 
05:04:24.410 --> 05:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
percent of it's at a distributor level
 
05:04:27.650 --> 05:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
all right you have lots to ponder and
 
05:04:29.810 --> 05:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
read and learn I'm going to reread the
 
05:04:31.250 --> 05:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
bill with a different set of eyes now
 
05:04:33.770 --> 05:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
and take notes and then we will try to
 
05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
find a date that works for everyone all
