medication um I'll just mention also
that

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
dcyf under their rules monitors and
 
00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 align:start position:0%

home should have the knowledge to know
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
the risks and side effects so that they
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
can oversee the use of these drugs by
 
00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
their child if they so choose to have
 
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
them taken by their
 
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 align:start position:0%

couple of letters of support um they
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
tried to mail them to the committee but
 
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh they got bounced back for some
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
reason and uh point out that one of them
 
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
is from the consumer representative on
 
00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
the FD FDA drug advisory
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
committee this legislation will not take
 
00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
effect for another year so it gives
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
everyone plenty of time uh to prepare um
 
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.720 align:start position:0%

format um so let me just close by
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
repeating that this is about the rights
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
of parents to be aware of the risks uh
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
possibly associated with the medication
 
00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:52.039 align:start position:0%
that is being
 
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
prescribed and about
 
00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919 align:start position:0%
transparency and I thank you very much

wber thank you so much and thank you for
 
00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:06.759 align:start position:0%
taking my questions just so I understand
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about what you are
 
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
contemplating is if a provider was going
 
00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
to prescribe rlin to a child this is the
 
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
document that they would need to present
 
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:21.879 align:start position:0%
to the parent and and go over and then
 
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
document that that had happened is that
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct okay thank you
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'll leave representative Woods
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
U thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question which I will have
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
some follow on on um um the first one I
 
00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
have on my list is um um is there any
 
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
need to mention uh that uh uh that often
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
times medication is prescribed for 3
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
months and then they're doing well then
 
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
they're off for another 3 months or so
 
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
need to go back on the
 
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
medication uh does this uh require that
 
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh review to occur
 
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.910 align:start position:0%
uh review to occur
again

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:13.959 align:start position:0%
um the the my reading is so if if um if
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
I understand your question correctly if
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
um they're prescribed to take it for 3
 
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
months 6 months or something um but then
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
later on um The Physician feels that the
 
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
child needs to go back on that
 
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.269 align:start position:0%
child needs to go back on that
medication

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
medication
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
um yes I would see um there's nothing um
 
00:09:36.069 --> 00:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
in here that says that they don't have
 
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
to do that um process again go over the
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
risks with the parent and get consent
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
again oh would there follow so that
 
00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:47.959 align:start position:0%
leaves a little question about exactly
 
00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
when that is necessary on the part of
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
the provider they've been on it before
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
they've explained it before so there's a
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
question there um the second um it
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
mentions a parent or legal guardian uh
 
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
often times uh uh kids that have mental
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
difficulties are not with a parent or a
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
guardian are living with ant or
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
grandmother uh or something along that
 
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
line uh also some of them are in uh
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
incarcerated uh and not available to uh
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
and or in a a psychiatric facility uh
 
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
how are those uh I mean um they they
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
would be handled um uh by
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
DCF um as I indicated as out of home
 
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
placements so if they were in a facility
 
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
for instance so there's no impact to to
 
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.629 align:start position:0%
for instance so there's no impact to to
those

00:10:41.629 --> 00:10:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
providers um if if they're prescribing
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
under Medicaid they still um um should
 
00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:49.710 align:start position:0%
under Medicaid they still um um should
uh

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:49.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
review um the uh medication guidelines
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
um who with whoever is responsible at
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
that uh facility
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
so it's up in the air okay but but the
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
the basic issue is that dcyf is to
 
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
monitor uh that so uh I I I would expect
 
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
that in a out of home placement it well
 
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
could be the uh dcyf case manager who is
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
going over um the risks of that
 
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
medication with the child because they
 
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:23.959 align:start position:0%
are responsible for overseeing uh the
 
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
medication so um you all set no go ahead
 
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
I'll come back okay representative mlan
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
and then representative Weber and then
 
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.350 align:start position:0%
and then representative Weber and then
representative

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
hartnet thank you Mr J thank you for
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um I'm assuming
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that there is some kind
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
of consent currently um so how does this
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
differ from the current state and and
 
00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:52.279 align:start position:0%
and what's what what what is the need I
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
I guess so you have the current state
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
some need pushed us to a new place and
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
this fulfills that need so could you
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
kind of walk us through that right um I
 
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
think even um when uh when I go to the
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh Walgreens and pick up prescription
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
for my wife um they ask U if uh would'
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
like to talk to the doctor um so those
 
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
types of things are in place but if if
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's a Medicaid um uh
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh involved prescription that's being
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
provided um we would like this in place
 
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
and I think um some of the letters that
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
um I passed out especially from the uh
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
consumer um advocate for the FDA um
 
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
will'll go into some of the other
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
aspects of
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
that that's it follow so so um so is it
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
is that my understanding then that
 
00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
currently these discussions can happen
 
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
but they're
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
voluntary uh I I believe that's
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory right this would make them
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
mandatory and having um written consent
 
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
to document that um um that uh um
 
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
information has been provided and is
 
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
understood by the parent one one more
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
followup and so and so as I read this it
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
does mandate a a discussion so when
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
you're saying you know make sure they
 
00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
understand this is mandating a physical
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
discussion as well yes thank you
 
00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:28.519 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
 
00:13:28.519 --> 00:13:30.550 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
representative

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
paret thank you uh one of uh
 
00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:34.839 align:start position:0%
representative Wood's questions brought
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
something new to my mind which is that
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
in the course of a child being in an
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
outof home
 
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
placement uh it's very often that uh
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
they are in the course of litigation
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
about parental
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
rights and during the entire pendency of
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
that litigation the parents of course
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
have their full parental rights and one
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
of the issues that is very difficult to
 
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
deal with in some cases where parents
 
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
are not interested in actually pursuing
 
00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
their parental rights in the way that I
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
might think they ought to but they
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
don't um is getting
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
consent which is required from parents
 
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
now uh for all kinds of different things
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
ranging from a school trip all the way
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
to important medication decisions so if
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
DCF doesn't actually have the authority
 
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
to give that consent and the parent is
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
either absent or unavailable or
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
unwilling to
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
engage uh what do we do then if the
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
child is in need of an
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
intervention and for example DCF also
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
believes that the child is in need of
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
intervention um I I think that that is
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
um an issue
 
00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:07.759 align:start position:0%
um U with the DCF and their involvement
 
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
with the case um I'm I'm not familiar um
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
directly with uh DCF procedures um in
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
that case um so I uh can't accurately uh
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
provide you an answer for that but um I
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
think that uh um if the parent is not
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
exercising uh parental
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
um responsibility or authority um and
 
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
dcyf is involved then DCF excuse me DCF
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
prescription H would you understand the
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
need that there might be a need there
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
for a clarification because currently
 
00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:54.870 align:start position:0%
for a clarification because currently
they

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
can't um I I right I if uh if you feel
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
that clarification is needed in that
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
regard I uh I would not object and
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah whatever you feel is necessary
 
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
um to uh uh you my intent is I I want if
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
this is Parental involvement with the
 
00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:19.399 align:start position:0%
child I I want them to be aware of what
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
the risks are and that's you know my
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
main intent if you need a clarification
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
on a few points um I have no problem
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and not to beat a
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
dead horse but let me beat it one more
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
time anyway um the concern that I have
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
is on the one hand parents whose
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
children have been removed from their
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
care continue to have their parental
 
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
rights so this bill for those
 
00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
parents uh runs into the concern that on
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
one hand there are parental rights which
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
are protected under the dcyf statutes
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
that you are
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
proposing to
 
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
limit in some way that is still not
 
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
particularly clear to all of us in this
 
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.510 align:start position:0%
particularly clear to all of us in this
statute

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
um if you feel this clarification needed
 
00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
in those instances um I would be glad to
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh work with whoever on getting that
 
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
clarification and putting that into an
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
amendment representative hartnet thank
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking the
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
question bring your microphone a little
 
00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:41.799 align:start position:0%
closer go uh just had a question why
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh
 
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
recipients uh basically it's um both
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
state and federal funding is involved in
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
that um and um uh it's felt that um uh
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
for instance um in statute we have U
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
Medicare medical providers but Medicare
 
00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
um really covers the gamut from state
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
and federal um so we figured that was
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
the uh best direction to take with that
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
um initially for this
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
legislation followup yeah um I'm
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
assuming that the drive uh to generate
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is essentially you think there
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be a tightening up of practice
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
here I'm still not quite getting yeah
 
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
why I'm sorry I'm still not quite
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
getting why it would just be focused on
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid recipients um uh I I think that
 
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:47.799 align:start position:0%
there is an effort um in many states um
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
to tighten up on um uh the prescription
 
00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
of these psychotropic drugs and make
 
00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
sure that there's parental um awareness
 
00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
before uh the medication is prescribed
 
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:03.640 align:start position:0%
because of the risks um involved in in
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
many cases um and so um you I've I've
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
talked with a number of agencies um
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
including uh International um agencies
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
um about this and um work closely with
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
them on the development of this um
 
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
legislation okay all set other questions
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
representative mlan
 
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
my question so I just want to follow up
 
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
on um representative Weber's train of
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
thought but I want to flip it up a
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
little bit so she was asking you
 
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes it is difficult um if the
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
parents are not engaged to get consent
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
she talk about you know I just want
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
consent to send the folks on a field
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
trip conversely though um uh in your
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
preparing for this bill are you aware of
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
instances where there are parent s who
 
00:20:02.909 --> 00:20:02.919 align:start position:0%
are engaged and are trying to get this
 
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
information um that they are unable to
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
do so and it has not been provided to
 
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
them um and and and things are just
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
prescribed without you know the consent
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
so it's voluntary right now so are there
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
instances yes I want to know what's
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
going into my child and it's frustrating
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
I just can't do that are you aware of
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
any of that I anodot anodot I've heard
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
of uh parents really not being aware of
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
all the
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
risks um and side effects um uh of a
 
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
medication that's being prescribed and
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
might not be prepared for um witnessing
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
some of these fi side effects if they do
 
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
occur uh because it's important that
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
they know what the potential side
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
effects are so that they can deal with
 
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
it follow up thank you Mr chair and and
 
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
and pardon my ignorance because my wife
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
and I never had children but if a school
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh sees an issue where they want to
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
prescribe and you you brought up ridin
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
um would that be is that done currently
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
without notification to the parent at
 
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
all or what what's the
 
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
or they they notify but they're not
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
having this level of consent so what
 
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
what how is it done right now right I I
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
believe that they would uh talk to the
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
counselor talk to the parent about um um
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
for instance ADHD right um and suggest
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
them to see a physician um uh there
 
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
there is incidentally legislation
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
pending um to make sure that um uh
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
prescriptions like that are not being
 
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
done um at the school level okay so so
 
00:21:53.549 --> 00:21:53.559 align:start position:0%
it would be involved with the parent and
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
then a follow-up discussion with the
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
parents with the child's physician
 
00:21:58.159 --> 00:21:59.070 align:start position:0%
parents with the child's physician
correct

00:21:59.070 --> 00:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
currently that is my understanding thank
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
you any other questions yeah
 
00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
representative Weber uh thank you Mr
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for taking the
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
question sure um do you know of any
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
other uh aspects in healthc care where
 
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.590 align:start position:0%
other uh aspects in healthc care where
we

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
similarly uh dictate how uh a
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
prescribing process would be
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
undertaken um uh I've never been on the
 
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services Committee just
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
on the education committee um but I have
 
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
had three children um and uh I am I do
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
not recall um that um so I'm I'm not
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
sure um the answer to your question
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
great on set yeah representative
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you again um having skimmed
 
00:22:59.789 --> 00:22:59.799 align:start position:0%
a little bit of the uh
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
a letter from the
 
00:23:03.679 --> 00:23:06.870 align:start position:0%
a letter from the
FDA

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
um uh Advocate it says the FDA develops
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
medication guides to communicate these
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
potential dangers in clear consumer
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
friendly language now if I read from
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
what you handed us one of the points
 
00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
that they're supposed to look for is
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
peripheral vasculopathy including Ray
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
noes phenomena on careful observation
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
for digital changes is necessary during
 
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
R ridd and treatment further clinical
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation EG Rheumatology referral may
 
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
be appropriate for patients who develop
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
signs or symptoms of periphery
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
peripheral vasculopathy do you agree
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
that that's a user friendly
 
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
language um
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh it depends on the
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
user um but uh I think that that would
 
00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:58.950 align:start position:0%
user um but uh I think that that would
be

00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh a point that the physician would be
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
discussing with the parent um I think
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
that the main thrust um with the
 
00:24:11.549 --> 00:24:11.559 align:start position:0%
guideline is um as in section five the
 
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
abuse misuse and addiction and other
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
risks that are listed there and I think
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
that the uh physician would be uh
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
perfectly capable of uh additionally um
 
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh considering a user friendly
 
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
language uh this might be user friendly
 
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
to the FDA but you know maybe not to
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:39.559 align:start position:0%
us if I may follow up um if if I may a
 
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
suggestion I would make for revision
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
although I'm not sure I would agree with
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
it even after that is that somebody
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
ought to do some work on uh whether for
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
example the sections about risks during
 
00:25:00.389 --> 00:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
lactation are appropriate for when
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with kids um but if this
 
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
is what you want handed to a parent do
 
00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:11.559 align:start position:0%
you think that a parent even with a
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
physician going over it is actually
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
going to be able to extract the
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
information that they know need to know
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
about risks to their children or is
 
00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
there a different
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
format that might be considerably more
 
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.470 align:start position:0%
format that might be considerably more
userfriendly

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
um this um document um is an
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
FDA um
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
document um I think that with physician
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
a walkth through um the parent would be
 
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
aware of the uh risks um involved and
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
the potential benefits to their child
 
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.310 align:start position:0%
the potential benefits to their child
thank

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
else saying no one else than thank you
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is David
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid good morning David chy the
 
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
deputy Medicaid director for the State
 
00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire um thank you for giving
 
00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
me the opportunity to testify this
 
00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
morning um I'm just here at generally
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
provid some information but um had a
 
00:26:32.669 --> 00:26:32.679 align:start position:0%
couple comments on the
 
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
legislation um I think as written um it
 
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
it appears the legislation really only
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
applies to Medicaid enrolled children
 
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
and just for reference that covers about
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
less than one in four children in New
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it's less than 25% so a
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
providers patient panel pediatric
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
patient panel um 75% of the the the
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
patients wouldn't necessarily apply to
 
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
this higher standard of informed consent
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and so we have some concerns that it
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
could create provider abrasion U where
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
they're treating U Medicaid patients
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
differently than their other patients um
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
and and that could create uh access
 
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
issues if um providers didn't want to
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
rearrange how they they practice
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
medicine just for a smaller portion of
 
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
their patient
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
panel um and access issues create costs
 
00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
and uh Health outcome concerns for for
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
our Medicaid kids
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
um there was also I I noticed um it it
 
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
appears to maybe omit some prescribers
 
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
of these cyp Tropic medicines um and I
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
was think the advanced practice
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
registered nurses are able to prescribe
 
00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
um psychotropic medicine um but the
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
reporting of um non-compliance would go
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Medicine which doesn't
 
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.029 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Medicine which doesn't
overse

00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
overse
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
them um and so you know similar concerns
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
about creating provid confusion as to
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
who can do what um when and then um
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid also has a unique mechanism
 
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
that allows for retroactive enrollment
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
so someone could get care and then
 
00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:13.519 align:start position:0%
become Medicaid eligible um or apply for
 
00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:15.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and that enrollment can go back
 
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
90 days um and so uh I think one
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
suggestion for the legislation would be
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
um to add a mechanism to address that
 
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
because the provider at the time of the
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
prescribing wouldn't know that the the
 
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
the patient in the future is going to
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
become Medicaid enrolled um and then
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
this this higher informed consent
 
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
standard would apply um and in talking
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
with our our medical director Dr Ballard
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
who is is not able to be here this
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
morning but he also referenced um there
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
may be certain emergency situations
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
where getting the enhanced informed
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
consent from the parent isn't
 
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
practicable for the the emergency care
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
that is necessary for the the child um
 
00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:57.799 align:start position:0%
and then on the administrative side we
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
had some concerns CU there's no
 
00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
appropriation and there will be
 
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
additional cost to investigate um and
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
ensure compliance um to then suspend
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
Medicaid claims and and report to the
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine um but happy to
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
answer any questions representative
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
wber thank you so much thank you for
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in so far as you
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
know because this may not be your Bailey
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
Wick could you describe to me what
 
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
happens when a child is seen uh um in
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
the schools under the Medicaid rubric
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
and how consent is or is not obtained
 
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
from a parent for a prescription now yep
 
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
so currently there's a Medicaid to
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
schools program um and that provides
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid coverage for Medicaid services
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
um that uh uh child enrolled in Medicaid
 
00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
um would get as part of their IEP or 504
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
plan um and as part of the IEP process
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
um parents consent and uh help develop
 
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
the IEP plan and 504 plan with the
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
schools um and if um prescribing of one
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
of these medications was part of that
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
care plan or treatment plan um the the
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
informed consent would would occur at
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
that that level um the the Medicaid the
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
schools program is not like a a a clinic
 
00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:27.799 align:start position:0%
within a school just for for Medicaid
 
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
kids it's it's specific to um you know
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
IEPs 504 plans um so more of that that
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
special education um the medical
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
component of that special education
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
piece could
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
I thank you and I'm just trying to
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
understand how that program works so uh
 
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
in the case of a child who had a 504
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
plan or an IEP that suggests that they
 
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
need psychotropic medication in order
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
for them to be able to fully participate
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:02.519 align:start position:0%
would they be
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
seen in the school or in a physician or
 
00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:09.799 align:start position:0%
other provider's office I assume that an
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
advanced practice nurse practitioner
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
might be the provider that they would
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
see I think in in many cases they would
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
be seen by their s in a primary care
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
practice outside the school for the
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
prescribing of that medication um I
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
think the I or 504 plan that is
 
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
consented to would you know be about
 
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
administering that drug if it would need
 
00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
needed to be administered um at school
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
um but there are some clinicians that I
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
think do come to the school um and if it
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
was if that was a part of it I guess it
 
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
could be but follow followup and in all
 
00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:48.039 align:start position:0%
cases where a child would be
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
seen by a provider for evaluation and
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
prescription of psychotropic
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
medications would the parent not be
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
required right now to give their
 
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
informed consent to that
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
treatment yeah um with any medical
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
treatment informed consent is an
 
00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:10.519 align:start position:0%
inherent part of the process and and for
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
minors it has to come from the parent or
 
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.750 align:start position:0%
minors it has to come from the parent or
legal

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
guardian and I I did have one other that
 
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
goes in a different direction it if if
 
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that somebody decided
 
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.430 align:start position:0%
one of the things that somebody decided
was

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
necessary was that there was a
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
disclosure that didn't look like this
 
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
but that was actually written in more
 
00:32:33.549 --> 00:32:33.559 align:start position:0%
plain English uh because I have 20 years
 
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
of formal education and I can't read
 
00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.710 align:start position:0%
of formal education and I can't read
this

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
um would there be a cost to the
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
department if the department was
 
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
designated as the agency to develop
 
00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.830 align:start position:0%
designated as the agency to develop
those

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
materials uh I I think it would depend
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
on the scope of the Department's
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
involvement um there would be you know a
 
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
resource cost to develop the material
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
but if the department had to print it
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
and mail it and provide it to providers
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
that that would be you know another cost
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
merer thank you Mr chair so in reading
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
this bill I just see that it's requiring
 
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
providers to take an extra few minutes
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
to provide some FDA information
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
including some risks which I think are
 
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.389 align:start position:0%
including some risks which I think are
very

00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
important so I'm still failing to
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
understand maybe you can help me um I'm
 
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
asking the question question of why this
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
would be a bad
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
thing I'm not saying it's necessarily A
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
A Bad Thing um it's just that it's
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
specific to Medicaid and it's not
 
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
specific to all all children that a
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
provider would treat um so the provider
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
will have to do something different that
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid patients than they do for
 
00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
all of their other patients um and and
 
00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:54.919 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is a small portion of any
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
provider's patient panel um just on
 
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:00.200 align:start position:0%
average in New Hampshire it's it's less
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
than one in four
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
children awesome representative mlan
 
00:34:08.669 --> 00:34:08.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I could ask two
 
00:34:10.589 --> 00:34:10.599 align:start position:0%
questions sure thank you for taking my
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
question so the first question uh again
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
following up on representative Weber
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
with respect to presenting something
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
that is more understandable uh to the
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
parent is what's provided because this
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
whole thing is very complex I agree but
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
the actual medication guide called for
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
in the bill I believe is just the final
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
page of this handle right so they
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be looking to digest all of
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
this which I agree is very complex but
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
the medication guide for discussion
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
asked for in the bill is just this final
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
page right so just is that so would we
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
want to be is is that clear enough or
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
would you want to maybe modify that
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
further um I may ask our Pharmacy
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
director to help um cuz she to help
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
answer that question I think she has a
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
little bit more experience in the
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
sure hi Margaret Clifford I'm the
 
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
pharmacy director for New Hampshire
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um I don't have the handout
 
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
that you have in front of you can
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
everyone hear okay
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
no you okay
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
you need to have the mic right in front
 
00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
of you so the handout has the FDA
 
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
document but I don't believe the whole
 
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
of the document is what's required to be
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
shared just the medication guide at the
 
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
back and I just wanted to clarify
 
00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:53.150 align:start position:0%
back and I just wanted to clarify
that

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
okay you just shut it off okay I didn't
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
I thought red might be off
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
um yeah it would just be the last
 
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:04.839 align:start position:0%
section okay thank you and then and then
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
my second sure my second question thank
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so my second question is um
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
you did bring up some concerns if this
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
bill were to be
 
00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
Revisited um where and because I was
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
kind of thinking since it was going
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
through the schools everybody whether
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
you on private insurance or not was kind
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
of going through that Medicaid rubric
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
but I think represent Senator Weber's uh
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
questioning has kind of clarified that
 
00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
for us so if we were to number one make
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
it an across theboard requirement and
 
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
not just caring out Medicaid and number
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
two go back to your other concern which
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
was with respect to arpn if it goes back
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Medicine arpn are not
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
accountable to the Board of Medicine so
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
basically revisiting the reporting
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
structure if we were to address add
 
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
those two issues with the bill does that
 
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
address the bulk of your concerns or um
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
are there other things that are still
 
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
kind of hanging out there uh you're
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
nervous about the only uh there are two
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
other one is the the retroactive
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
enrollment um just unlike primary
 
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
Insurance where you you're you uh don't
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
get coverage until you're enrolled in
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid you could see a provider and
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
then uh apply for Medicaid become
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enrolled and that Medicaid
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
coverage can retro back up to 90 days
 
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
okay um so it would cover um that
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
portion so just having a mechanism well
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
I guess if it applies to all all kids
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
universally that's actually not not
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't be an issue that would
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
be if it would just applied to Medicaid
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
so um sorry um but just the emergency
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
situations exception um and then I do
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
know this would create some cost or
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
resources to DCF and I think um that
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
that's already been raised and getting
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
dcf's input on on that would
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
thank you both for the
 
00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:03.079 align:start position:0%
clarification representative
 
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
Drew under what circumstances would one
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
emergency prescribed Brin do you
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
know I I don't know um but I don't have
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
a medical background but it was
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
something our medical director um
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
brought out but he's unfortunately out
 
00:38:20.109 --> 00:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
this week
 
00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:22.839 align:start position:0%
um anyone
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:32.839 align:start position:0%

representative Jack Flanigan from
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
thank Mr chairman and you're taking all
 
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
speech um I was asked by former members
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
of the house that are behind me and the
 
01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:46.039 align:start position:0%
audience that are going to testify to
 
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
submit this resolution to to support and
 
01:01:53.789 --> 01:01:53.799 align:start position:0%
also um basically provide some platform
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
for people to know um how hard they
 
01:02:00.269 --> 01:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
worked during the co pandemic and you
 
01:02:02.349 --> 01:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
know over time we have and let me let me
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
preface that by saying I come from a
 
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
family of healthc care providers nurse
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
my mother was a nurse my father was a
 
01:02:09.069 --> 01:02:09.079 align:start position:0%
dentist and believe it or not that's
 
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
Healthcare and my uncle who's still
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
alive was a retired surgeon um so
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
there's a health care background in me
 
01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
um but what happens is over time I think
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
we tend to forget how bad covid-19
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
exposure to the public that people I
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
have friends that have died from covid
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
um but and unfortunately it was before
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
the uh immunization process came out so
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
you know God Rest his soul Bob Burger
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
but um I think the thing is that over
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
time we forget how deadly that virus
 
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
really was uh and having healthc care
 
01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.150 align:start position:0%
really was uh and having healthc care
providers

01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
working during that part you know
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
unknown whether they're bringing it home
 
01:02:58.029 --> 01:02:58.039 align:start position:0%
to their families and things like that I
 
01:03:00.269 --> 01:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
think it's important that we basically
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
have a you know a resolution from this
 
01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
body saying how much we thank them and
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
how much we uh really appreciate the
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
work that they did where a lot of people
 
01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:10.839 align:start position:0%
just wouldn't do it and with that I'm
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
going to defer any further testimony to
 
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.760 align:start position:0%

but I'll answer anybody's question too
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
because everybody knows me here knows
 
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:24.520 align:start position:0%

01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%

is a very important resolution today uh
 
01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
I stand in support of this
 
01:04:20.829 --> 01:04:20.839 align:start position:0%
resolution so um I've been a nurse in
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire since
 
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
1993 but I've never served um in this
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
capacity for any recognition at all uh I
 
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
earned the title of RN which I'm very
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
proud to have had my entire career and I
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
take great pride in caring for people at
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
arguably the most uh vulnerable times of
 
01:04:41.789 --> 01:04:41.799 align:start position:0%
their lives um I love my time as a nurse
 
01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
I'm now retired I finally retired from
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
nursing but I love my time as a nurse
 
01:04:47.309 --> 01:04:47.319 align:start position:0%
and I found my experiences with my
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
patients and their loved ones um and in
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
my community to be most rewarding during
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 pandemic um that was a very
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
difficult time as you all know for our
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
nation and for our state especially for
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
our healthcare workers all of our
 
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
Frontline workers and that's not just
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
nurses it's doctors nurses dentists you
 
01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
know ancillary services our EMT
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
everybody um and it was for many reasons
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
the logistics made it very uh difficult
 
01:05:16.269 --> 01:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
to care it made it almost nearly
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
impossible from lack of supplies to
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
inconsistent and oftentimes
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
contradictory guidance from the CDC and
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
our state and our national government
 
01:05:28.829 --> 01:05:28.839 align:start position:0%
as to what the rules were regarding care
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
delivery um and those were ever changing
 
01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
nurses as a nurse we were required to
 
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
use innovation we were inquired to use
 
01:05:38.589 --> 01:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
Ingenuity anything we had in order to
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
properly address the health care needs
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
of those we served fear was another big
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
issue and it was crippling patients were
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
afraid and they presented questions that
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
nurses as that I couldn't answer for the
 
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
first time which was you know a very
 
01:05:54.269 --> 01:05:54.279 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable place to be as a nurse and
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
not being able to answer
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
questions that your patients or their
 
01:05:59.950 --> 01:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
family members may have had some
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers were so paralyzed
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
with fear that they opted to shelter at
 
01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
home and that created critical Staffing
 
01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
shortages during this time and um and we
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
had a very exhausted Workforce during
 
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
that whole period National fear created
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
a situation of lockdown of our hospitals
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
which separated families from their ill-
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
loved ones and that only increased the
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
fear and anxiety across this country
 
01:06:26.589 --> 01:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
with respect to co yet nurses doctors
 
01:06:29.269 --> 01:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
ancillary staff First Responders and all
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
other healthcare workers bravely served
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
knowing that they could become ill with
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
covid themselves and knowing that their
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
days would carry extra stressors that
 
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
were evolved around Staffing s shortages
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
limited resources additional testing
 
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
isolation requirements and most
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
importantly our patients with
 
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
exacerbated fear and anxiety related to
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
the isolation and the
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
separation but we still stepped up we
 
01:06:58.029 --> 01:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
stepped up and we provided compassionate
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
and understanding uh care all while
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
fighting an invisible enemy and adapting
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
to almost daily new mandates to our care
 
01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
delivery in my 36 years as a civilian
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
nurse and as a military nurse I cared
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
for people and their loved ones in every
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
situation good and bad I've delivered
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
babies which is a very happy time and
 
01:07:20.910 --> 01:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
I've also provided care and a
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
battlefield in the war zones I've
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
responded when our community has needed
 
01:07:28.269 --> 01:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
me and I served aboard the UNS Comfort
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
when it went to New York City and
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
provided Co relief to a city that was
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
especially hardhead um I in fact got Co
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
on that ship and and understand the
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
isolation as I was um quarantined for
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
over a month as a result of Contracting
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
covid while I was on the ship when I
 
01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
returned from New York City I was
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
working as a prosecutor in Hillsboro
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
County but I also
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
recognized um that I'm also an attorney
 
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
but I um
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
also they don't put nurses as
 
01:07:59.549 --> 01:07:59.559 align:start position:0%
prosecutors I probably should have
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
clarified that uh but I also recognized
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
that our community um really desperately
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
needed nurses so Monday through Friday I
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
worked as a prosecutor for Hillsboro
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
County and then on Saturdays and Sundays
 
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
I worked at a nursing home to provide
 
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
care there because they were desperate
 
01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.189 align:start position:0%
care there because they were desperate
for

01:08:15.189 --> 01:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:08:15.199 --> 01:08:17.149 align:start position:0%
for
nurses

01:08:17.149 --> 01:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
um my clinical skills were put to good
 
01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
use but it was my human skills that
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
mattered the most um
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
the nursing home facility that I worked
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
in like I said it had huge shortages and
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
because at that time uh the rules were
 
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
families couldn't be with their elderly
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
family members in these
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
facilities um I sat with a lot of people
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
who died and they would have died
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
otherwise alone but the sad part of that
 
01:08:48.349 --> 01:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
was that those folks died without their
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
family with them and I became their
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
family for that short period of time um
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think that brought much comfort
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
to anybody it didn't bring Comfort to
 
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
the families for sure who couldn't be
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
with their loved one to say their final
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
goodbyes it didn't bring Comfort to the
 
01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
patient to not or the resident to not
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
have their family member with them and
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
it certainly didn't make me feel good
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
knowing that I was the only person that
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
was going to be there with them during
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
this time that was because of policies
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
where we just were allow were not
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to have family members with
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
their p with their uh loved ones as they
 
01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.229 align:start position:0%
their p with their uh loved ones as they
were

01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
dying um um but that was a standard of
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
care and those experiences have what are
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
what have left indelible marks I think
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
on our health care providers across this
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
state especially and our nation during
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
that most scary and uncertain
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
time um so as I stated at the beginning
 
01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
of my testimony I don't need personal
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
recognition for my service to our state
 
01:09:50.110 --> 01:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
or to my nation um during the covid
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic and all and all of the response
 
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
efforts however I believe this
 
01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.189 align:start position:0%
efforts however I believe this
resolution

01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
01:09:59.310 --> 01:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
is a positive gesture by our state that
 
01:10:01.149 --> 01:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
validates the hard emotions that
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers experienced during
 
01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and it provides um a state
 
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of those difficult days
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
that we all endured and offer some
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
healing for those of us who experienced
 
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
a whole gabit of feelings at a time when
 
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
healthc care delivery in our history was
 
01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
uncertain chaotic filled with fear
 
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
everchanging and the rules um dominated
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
our personal and professional lives so I
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to share
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
my thoughts today uh I hope all of you
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
uh who experienced Co in a way that is
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
unique to you and your families had
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
positive outcomes for you I know it was
 
01:10:45.390 --> 01:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
a tough time for all of us and I would
 
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
urge you to consider a vote in support
 
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
of hr16 because I do think um it's a
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
collective giant hug from the state of
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to those on this 5-year
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
anniversary believe it or not it's been
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
5 years since all of this started um
 
01:11:02.669 --> 01:11:02.679 align:start position:0%
just to recognize and say thank you for
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
your service so with that um I'll answer
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
any questions are there any questions
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
Becker representative
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I mean I think
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
everybody recognizes that the
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
contribution of our healthcare workers
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
through covid was Herculean um I I'm
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
just wondering with this
 
01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
resolution um how how is it going to be
 
01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
communicated I mean how how are going
 
01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
how are people who serve during that
 
01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
time even going to know that it exists
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
um and so so I guess we approve it where
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
does it go from here thanks for that
 
01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
question so obviously it'll be get right
 
01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
on the house floor um I hope the media
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
will cover it and so it'll get sent out
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
that way there's a lot of organizations
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
here lobbyists the Ana the American
 
01:12:03.629 --> 01:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association the American Medical
 
01:12:05.229 --> 01:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry not the American the state
 
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association the State Medical
 
01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
Association you've got your state EMTs
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
paramedics your First Responders
 
01:12:15.229 --> 01:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
associations all of them have a
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
legislative uh liaison who will be
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
tracking any kind of legislation or HRS
 
01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
that come out they should be conveying
 
01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
those back um good news stories I mean
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
today we don't have a lot of good news
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
stories every time you turn on the TV or
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
every time you open the paper you don't
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
get a lot of really good news stories
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
and so when there is a good news stories
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
I I I feel like we're unique in the
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that that gets to
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
be a headliner and so I would hope that
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
the local papers and that the local TV
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
stations and radio stations would also
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
recognize when they're uh broadcasting
 
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
about legislation or about activities
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
that go on in the house that they'll
 
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
broadcast that um I was a member of the
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Nurses Association and so
 
01:12:59.790 --> 01:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
these types of things would get shared
 
01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:01.960 align:start position:0%

covid-19 pandemic broke out I was
 
01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:04.360 align:start position:0%

National Guard I'm a New Hampshire
 
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
resident I was working for
 
01:14:13.229 --> 01:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and that first few weeks
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
it was all hands- on Deck to build field
 
01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals in every concert Stadium venue
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
every place that we could find and then
 
01:14:21.629 --> 01:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
coordinate with other agencies with FEMA
 
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
with local hospitals Etc on how they
 
01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
were going to be staffed if hospital
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
system was overwhelmed you know after
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
that it became massive coordination with
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
healthc care providers including trying
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
to uh fill in some of their gaps we you
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
know had a uh we had a a veterans home
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
where the whole staff got Co and we had
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
soldiers pretending to be healthcare
 
01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
workers trying to staff that home
 
01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers were working multiple
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
shifts back to back you were either sick
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
at home or you were you were at work
 
01:14:51.149 --> 01:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
there was no vacation there was no rest
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
cycle there was infinite overtime
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
whether it was funded or not you were
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
either you you were either sick or you
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
were at work and if you were working a
 
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
double or or even a triple even though
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's not legal that's where you were
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
because that's where the people needed
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
you to be um there were medical
 
01:15:07.229 --> 01:15:07.239 align:start position:0%
providers that were covering shifts that
 
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
were not in their specialty you may have
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
had a niku nurse covering uh trauma
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
because that's where the need was at
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
that time so there was a lot of uh there
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
was a lot of crossplay among healthc
 
01:15:20.669 --> 01:15:20.679 align:start position:0%
care providers just to fill in the gaps
 
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
and that led to extensive family
 
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
separation and extensive burnout as well
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
I actually have an acquaint who was an
 
01:15:29.629 --> 01:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
EMT for 15 years going into the co uh
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic and then afterwards um that
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
person left their trade to go back to
 
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
college because they were developing
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
PTSD from being in an ambulance all the
 
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
time so if if this is a small thing that
 
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
we as a state can do to recognize the
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
people that took that the brunt of that
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
Force you know head on whether they
 
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
whether they were ready or not cuz no
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
one is ever ever ready for that kind of
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
operation then I recommend that we pass
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
this resolution thank you for your time
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
representative Ellen Reed from
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you honorable
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
members for the record my name is Ellen
 
01:16:31.149 --> 01:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
Reed I represent Rockingham 10 new
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
market in
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
newfields um this is obviously a
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
no-brainer I think I can't imagine
 
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
anyone being opposed to uh this
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
resolution but I want to honor the
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
testimony that came before me of people
 
01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
who saw the situation on the ground
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
firsthand of healthare workers during
 
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
that time I am not a healthcare worker
 
01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
no one in my immediate family or in my
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
immediate friends are healthcare workers
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
so I am not going to speak to that
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
aspect I trust everything that has been
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
told to me about what it was like um I'm
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to speak to the perspective of
 
01:17:09.149 --> 01:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
someone being in office during that time
 
01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
because me and I think only a couple of
 
01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
people here actually were serving when
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
covid became the thing that we all um
 
01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
learned it would be so just generally in
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
our culture we give a lot of Praise a
 
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
lot of Praise um and often rightly so to
 
01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement Officers to uh veterans
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
who've served because these are people
 
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
who we acknowledge are risking their
 
01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
lives for the
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
public we almost never give that level
 
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
of praise and certainly not the level of
 
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
um benefits freebies discounts to
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers for their service but
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
this pandemic highlighted the fact that
 
01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
they indeed do risk their very lives um
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
just on the numbers I quickly Googled
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
um, 1500 healthcare workers died
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
directly during the the phase that was
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
the pandemic of uh Co they contracted in
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
service a 100,000 that's across the
 
01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
country I don't have New Hampshire
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
specific numbers 100,000
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
worldwide so I think it's extremely
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
important to um acknowledge that these
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
people were in fact risking their lives
 
01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
and in fact this was a time that as a
 
01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
legislator there was a lot of talk about
 
01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
who was essential and who was not
 
01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.750 align:start position:0%
who was essential and who was not
essential

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
essential
 
01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
in in so far as their occupation goes
 
01:18:30.669 --> 01:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
and I would argue heavily that at any
 
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
time healthcare workers are one of the
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
most essential professions that we could
 
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
possibly have more essential even than
 
01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
law enforcement more essential even than
 
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
uh National Defense which I'm not saying
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
those aren't essential I'm saying that
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
if you don't have people surviving if
 
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
you don't have people who can stay alive
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to defend and there are
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
no laws left to enforce so to my
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
perspective um we were we were declaring
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
all these different people essential
 
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
non-essential what have you we we sent
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
grocery Baggers to work some of whom
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
were actually elderly um which is
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
another social commentary that can be
 
01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
made um during that time as essential
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
workers you know who wasn't essential
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
apparently and this is where I'm going
 
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
to get a little bit maybe controversial
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
we apparently weren't we weren't we I I
 
01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
contacted the speaker's office so many
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
times for three solid months begging
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
pleading please please can we please
 
01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
meet can we do something about this
 
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
terrible pandemic we abdicated all of
 
01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.110 align:start position:0%
terrible pandemic we abdicated all of
our

01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility we took the sacred Duty
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
that we were entrusted with by being
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
voted into office specifically for when
 
01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:41.560 align:start position:0%
we needed to do something for the people
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
like that and we just said no too
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
dangerous for us but we made sure all
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
those other people went to work and we
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
didn't and that bothered me deeply at
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
the time and not only did not act on
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
that terrible crisis that was happening
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
we didn't even do our regular job 700
 
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
bills died because of an action because
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
we blew by the deadlines and didn't do
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
anything about it we just put our hands
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
in there an entire one of the three
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
branches of government just said nope
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're not doing it so I think healthcare
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
workers deserve a lot more than a
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
resolution a lot more but at the very
 
01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
very least we can give them a resolution
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
telling them that yes what we were not
 
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
willing to do not even a little bit you
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
all were willing to do times 100 so that
 
01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
is my perspective as a non-healthcare
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
worker at the time and um I don't know
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
what questions you could possibly have
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to take them are there any
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is former
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.709 --> 01:20:59.719 align:start position:0%
H H
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative horn actually I think
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
was the um this was your idea right you
 
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
had called me and you called
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative Flanigan so thank you for
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
bringing this to
 
01:21:13.229 --> 01:21:13.239 align:start position:0%
us uh good morning Mr chairman you are
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
of course correct members of HHS and EA
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
kind of a long title for the record my
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
name is Warner
 
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
horn I want to thank you for considering
 
01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
the house resolution today and as some
 
01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
of the previous speakers have touched
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
on five years ago this March 16th we
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
shut New Hampshire
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
down we divided up our population
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
between essential and non-essential
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
workers and we didn't ask permission we
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
just told you you're essential go do
 
01:21:44.159 --> 01:21:45.070 align:start position:0%
just told you you're essential go do
your

01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:21:49.629 --> 01:21:49.639 align:start position:0%
job and when you have movies being mad
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
about being made about veterans when you
 
01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
have movies being made about law
 
01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement there PR just few movies
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
being made about Frontline healthcare
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
workers and to the good representative's
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
point we might intellectually be aware
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.149 align:start position:0%
of the
sacrifices

01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
sacrifices
 
01:22:13.709 --> 01:22:13.719 align:start position:0%
but my concern and the reason for this
 
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
is we need to explicitly State how
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
grateful we are that these people made
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
the ultimate sacrifice in some cases the
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
national statistics
 
01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.189 align:start position:0%

01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
plus I can't I can't imagine what
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
families went through in New Hampshire
 
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
who had Frontline healthcare workers
 
01:22:39.189 --> 01:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
become sick and die because somebody
 
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
essential I want to make sure that the
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
politics that went into this covid
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
crisis aren't affected by this this
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
isn't about politics this isn't about
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
right or left this is about the fact
 
01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.270 align:start position:0%
right or left this is about the fact
that

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:59.310 --> 01:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
when you step up answer the call
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
Sacrifice by passing by getting sick and
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
Contracting long lifelong
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
illness you need to know that that was
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
important you need to know that that was
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
recognized and one of the mechanisms we
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
have in New
 
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are the house
 
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
resolutions the house has an
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to establish their position
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
on the sacrifices made by the Frontline
 
01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.790 align:start position:0%
on the sacrifices made by the Frontline
healthcare

01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
workers I had I was in office I was on
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
my County's nursing home
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I had a front row seat to
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
some of the stories that were coming out
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
stories you've heard from previous
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
speakers people who were gathered
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
outside the window of a loved
 
01:23:55.709 --> 01:23:55.719 align:start position:0%
one and when you had nursing home
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
workers who were seeing that kind of
 
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
misery firsthand on a repeated basis
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily what they thought
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
they were getting into when they applied
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
for those positions that you would be
 
01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:09.550 align:start position:0%
for those positions that you would be
declared

01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
declared
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
essential that most supports that they
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
had depended on would be evaporated that
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
Staffing problems
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
would complicate your position in ways
 
01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
nobody could have
 
01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
anticipated for those reason reasons I
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
would urge the passage of hr19 hr16 send
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
it to the governor's desk so that New
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can send a clear and
 
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.390 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can send a clear and
unambiguous

01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
unambiguous
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
signal that this is something we care
 
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
about that the people who sacrificed
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
during the covid
 
01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
crisis are recognized and valued and
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to answer

morning Mr chairman honorable members
 
02:03:32.350 --> 02:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
this testimony represents My Views and
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
the views and interests of my
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
constituents in graft and 18 and I
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
believe of healthcare consumers across
 
02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
the state my testimony is not made on
 
02:03:44.109 --> 02:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
behalf of any private employer nor
 
02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
should it be construed to represent the
 
02:03:48.709 --> 02:03:48.719 align:start position:0%
views of any of my employers I'm
 
02:03:50.270 --> 02:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
representative Donald McFarland from
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
Orange and I'm here today because every
 
02:03:55.109 --> 02:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
Granite data deserves access to
 
02:03:58.109 --> 02:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
Affordable highquality Health Care not a
 
02:04:00.990 --> 02:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
system where monopolies drive up prices
 
02:04:03.510 --> 02:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
and limit patient choices our
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
constituents deserve a fair and
 
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
transparent Health Care system one where
 
02:04:10.830 --> 02:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
patients are treated equally not based
 
02:04:13.069 --> 02:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
on whether they have insurance or with
 
02:04:16.589 --> 02:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
whom but based on their medical needs at
 
02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
its core hr14 is about fairness and
 
02:04:22.350 --> 02:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
protecting our communities we've all
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
heard the stories families struggling to
 
02:04:28.350 --> 02:04:28.360 align:start position:0%
pay for basic care seniors unable to
 
02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:29.629 align:start position:0%
pay for basic care seniors unable to
afford

02:04:29.629 --> 02:04:29.639 align:start position:0%
afford
 
02:04:32.350 --> 02:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
prescriptions others who don't even seek
 
02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:34.719 align:start position:0%
care because they feel they will not be
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
able to afford it and small businesses
 
02:04:39.629 --> 02:04:39.639 align:start position:0%
burdened by Rising insurance premiums
 
02:04:41.830 --> 02:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
these aren't just statistics they're are
 
02:04:43.709 --> 02:04:43.719 align:start position:0%
friends they're are neighbors and our
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
loved ones and when healthc care
 
02:04:47.229 --> 02:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
providers consolidate their power
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
unchecked these struggles become even
 
02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
worse patients lose and big corporations
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
win what hr14 does is simple it calls on
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
our attorney general to take a harder
 
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
look at the ways monopolistic healthare
 
02:05:07.229 --> 02:05:07.239 align:start position:0%
practices and pharmaceutical practices
 
02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:09.719 align:start position:0%
are harming the people of New Hampshire
 
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's not about punishing success it's
 
02:05:13.310 --> 02:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
about ensuring fairness in a system that
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
should put Patients First not corporate
 
02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
profits imagine walking into a grocery
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
store where the price of milk depends
 
02:05:24.549 --> 02:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
not on its cost but on who you are one
 
02:05:28.030 --> 02:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
Shopper pays $3 another pays 15 and yet
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
another is told they can only buy it if
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
they agree to a long complicated payment
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
plan that would be outrageous but it's
 
02:05:36.350 --> 02:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
exactly how pricing Works in our
 
02:05:37.950 --> 02:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
Healthcare and pharmaceutical systems
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
today right now the cost of Medical Care
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
is not determined by what a service
 
02:05:45.589 --> 02:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
actually costs to provide nor by Fair
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
competitive market forces but by opaque
 
02:05:50.350 --> 02:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
and arbitrary pricing schemes set by
 
02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
powerful H hospital system systems
 
02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
patients are charged wildly different
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
prices for the same procedure not based
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
on lawful price structuring but based on
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
who their insurer is or whether they
 
02:06:03.629 --> 02:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
have insurance at all a privately
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
insured patient might pay three times
 
02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
less than someone paying cash a Medicare
 
02:06:12.109 --> 02:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
patient is charged One Rate while a
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
self-employed person with a high
 
02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:16.679 align:start position:0%
deductible plan is charged another a
 
02:06:18.549 --> 02:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
small business owner might pay an
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
inflated rate just because they don't
 
02:06:22.750 --> 02:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
belong to a large corporate Insurance
 
02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
Network and the same holds true for
 
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
drugs the exact same bottle of insulin
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
from an American manufacturer is sold
 
02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
for one price in Canada and four times
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
that price here in New Hampshire an
 
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
antivenin in Texas is sold for 20 times
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
the price which the same manufacturer
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
obtains for the same product in Mexico
 
02:06:45.310 --> 02:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
this is not a free market this is price
 
02:06:46.990 --> 02:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
fixing by Monopoly
 
02:06:49.790 --> 02:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
power when a patient needs care they
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
should know what they'll be charged and
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
they should not be gouged based on who
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
they are who their employer is whether
 
02:06:57.990 --> 02:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
they're self-employed or whether they
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
have the wrong insurance plan the United
 
02:07:04.549 --> 02:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
States Supreme Court has already ruled
 
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
that price fixing schemes like these
 
02:07:09.229 --> 02:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
violate Federal antitrust law and you'll
 
02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
see that I have cited two cases in the
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
resolution let me highlight those cases
 
02:07:16.990 --> 02:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
for you in group life and health
 
02:07:18.750 --> 02:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
insurance company versus Royal Drug
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
Company the Supreme Court ruled that
 
02:07:22.990 --> 02:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
that Healthcare markets including
 
02:07:25.470 --> 02:07:25.480 align:start position:0%
insurers and providers must comply with
 
02:07:28.669 --> 02:07:28.679 align:start position:0%
antitrust laws the ruling confirmed that
 
02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
pricing agreements designed to exclude
 
02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
competition are
 
02:07:35.709 --> 02:07:35.719 align:start position:0%
unlawful in Arizona versus Maricopa
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
County the Court ruled that medical
 
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
providers cannot set fixed
 
02:07:41.629 --> 02:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
non-competitive prices for different
 
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
groups of consumers and it rejected the
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
idea that Health Care should be exempt
 
02:07:48.750 --> 02:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
from fair pricing and competition laws
 
02:07:51.229 --> 02:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
these rulings make it clear Healthcare
 
02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
is not above the laww hospitals and
 
02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
insurers cannot create arbitrary pricing
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
structures that have no basis in actual
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
costs but are simply designed to extract
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
the maximum possible revenue from
 
02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
different patients and as you'll see in
 
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
the resolution we have seen that Revenue
 
02:08:10.350 --> 02:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
increase relative to GDP in ways that
 
02:08:12.549 --> 02:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
are unacceptable we are seeing healthc
 
02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
Care at 20% of GDP today and only a few
 
02:08:19.229 --> 02:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
short decades ago it was at four or 5%
 
02:08:22.750 --> 02:08:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
I I could go on but I I think that this
 
02:08:29.549 --> 02:08:29.559 align:start position:0%
committee well understands this problem
 
02:08:32.430 --> 02:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
and well understands that what is needed
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
is action by the attorney general and by
 
02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
the other states Attorneys General and
 
02:08:43.229 --> 02:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
so I urge your support for hr14 and I'm
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
happy to yield the questions thank you
 
02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you any
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
questions my representative Weber
 
02:08:55.149 --> 02:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:08:59.350 --> 02:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
you for taking my my question
 
02:09:03.069 --> 02:09:03.079 align:start position:0%
um I have I I don't disagree with
 
02:09:05.629 --> 02:09:05.639 align:start position:0%
anything you have said and um you've
 
02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
given a
 
02:09:10.030 --> 02:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
great overview of the
 
02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
problem what I want to know is why you
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
have chosen to bring this as a
 
02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
resolution which has no force in law
 
02:09:20.750 --> 02:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's sort of question number one and
 
02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
if I may just ask the carer
 
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
question um if anything is to be
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
investigated there are associated costs
 
02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
and of course we do not investigate
 
02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
costs when there is a resolution but
 
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
have you done any investigation about
 
02:09:40.030 --> 02:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
the costs that might be
 
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
involved in doing what your resolution
 
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
asks great question uh or set of
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
questions so let let me respond to those
 
02:09:52.149 --> 02:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh in turn first of all I actually did
 
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
start off with this intended to be a
 
02:09:57.629 --> 02:09:57.639 align:start position:0%
bill and intended to be a bill that
 
02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
would um not mandate that the Attorney
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
General uh prosecute certain entities
 
02:10:08.109 --> 02:10:08.119 align:start position:0%
because that would be uh a a conflict of
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
you know the the separation of powers um
 
02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
but at least require certain reporting
 
02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
from him um and require other actions by
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's
 
02:10:22.549 --> 02:10:22.559 align:start position:0%
office I was not able to to get to a
 
02:10:25.709 --> 02:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
version of that bill language um
 
02:10:28.270 --> 02:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
courtesy of OSS that I thought was
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
viable and I decided that the better
 
02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
course of action than present to you a
 
02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
bill that I myself didn't think was in
 
02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
good order uh was to submit this
 
02:10:45.390 --> 02:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
resolution this year and hope uh that
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
the AG respects our point of view and
 
02:10:53.109 --> 02:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
takes action uh and if that doesn't come
 
02:10:55.149 --> 02:10:55.159 align:start position:0%
to pass I think that there are other
 
02:10:57.990 --> 02:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
actions that um this body and the
 
02:11:01.149 --> 02:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
general court can take uh I will tell
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
you though that in the course of
 
02:11:04.750 --> 02:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
preparing that language that that
 
02:11:06.910 --> 02:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately I didn't move forward with I
 
02:11:08.430 --> 02:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
spoke with the Attorney General on a
 
02:11:09.310 --> 02:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
02:11:14.189 --> 02:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
occasions um he expressed that he is um
 
02:11:17.830 --> 02:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
interested and and uh understands the
 
02:11:19.549 --> 02:11:19.559 align:start position:0%
concern and and I think to some extent
 
02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
shares the concern although I did not
 
02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
get ultimately uh any firm point of view
 
02:11:28.510 --> 02:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
from him as to whether uh he believes
 
02:11:31.390 --> 02:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
that this is a um a set of problems he
 
02:11:34.350 --> 02:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
wants to move forward with um but I I
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
certainly in the course of that uh and
 
02:11:38.030 --> 02:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
in the course of my conversations with
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
the legislative researchers talked about
 
02:11:43.790 --> 02:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
the potential Financial impact in fact
 
02:11:46.030 --> 02:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
in one version of my draft I had
 
02:11:49.790 --> 02:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
contemplated making um a a stipulation
 
02:11:53.790 --> 02:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
about a l in the budget for it and what
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
I received back was uh strong guidance
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
that that was unnecessary strong
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
guidance from both legislative services
 
02:12:04.430 --> 02:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
and frankly from the AG's office that uh
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
they are already uh afforded uh the
 
02:12:10.030 --> 02:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
ability to direct their attention to
 
02:12:12.629 --> 02:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
where they see fit and I think the
 
02:12:14.750 --> 02:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
question at hand is whether they should
 
02:12:17.470 --> 02:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
be looking in this particular direction
 
02:12:21.750 --> 02:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
and if they do I am sure that in the
 
02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
course of winning some of these lawsuits
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
they would be able to recover any cost
 
02:12:29.669 --> 02:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
have other questions representative
 
02:12:33.790 --> 02:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
Woods no thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
certainly understand the intent and uh
 
02:12:41.069 --> 02:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
from my personal perspective would
 
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
certainly agree uh at the at the face of
 
02:12:48.750 --> 02:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
it however um would it be uh that in
 
02:12:51.629 --> 02:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
fact uh there should be directed
 
02:12:54.069 --> 02:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh in a a slightly different direction
 
02:12:56.629 --> 02:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
by that I mean uh it seems like this
 
02:12:57.950 --> 02:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
carries the assumption that a
 
02:13:00.990 --> 02:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
market-based system is the system that
 
02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
we should work
 
02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
with um whereas there have been some
 
02:13:07.950 --> 02:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
questions that if this were healthc Care
 
02:13:09.870 --> 02:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
were not delivered on a market-based
 
02:13:12.030 --> 02:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
system that the problems that you've
 
02:13:15.149 --> 02:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
addressed would in fact go away would
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
you care to address that I'd be happy to
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
address that representative and can I
 
02:13:21.549 --> 02:13:21.559 align:start position:0%
just understand essentially what you're
 
02:13:23.709 --> 02:13:23.719 align:start position:0%
asking are you asking would we be better
 
02:13:25.629 --> 02:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
off with a Cooperative
 
02:13:27.990 --> 02:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
system there's a variety of systems one
 
02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
of which would be a single
 
02:13:30.119 --> 02:13:31.750 align:start position:0%
of which would be a single
paay

02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
paay
 
02:13:34.669 --> 02:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
so I mean first and foremost I would say
 
02:13:37.870 --> 02:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
to you that that is not the basis of our
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
country and of our
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
constitution uh either at the federal
 
02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
level or at the state level uh I believe
 
02:13:48.870 --> 02:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
in free markets I don't believe that we
 
02:13:51.709 --> 02:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
have free markets in all cases just as I
 
02:13:54.669 --> 02:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
described here um but I would also point
 
02:13:57.709 --> 02:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
you rather than making my response be
 
02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
based upon our particular points of view
 
02:14:02.549 --> 02:14:02.559 align:start position:0%
on these things I would point you to the
 
02:14:05.189 --> 02:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruling itself that I
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
referenced and so you know if I look at
 
02:14:16.270 --> 02:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
um the the ruling in um the uh sorry one
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
second here if I look at the ruling in
 
02:14:22.270 --> 02:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
in group life versus Royal drug right uh
 
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
that ruling makes it abundantly clear
 
02:14:29.470 --> 02:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
that Cooperative pricing is not in fact
 
02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
lawful under our Constitution and I
 
02:14:34.549 --> 02:14:34.559 align:start position:0%
think that when you talk about other
 
02:14:36.830 --> 02:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
structures such as Single Payer systems
 
02:14:46.510 --> 02:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:49.390 --> 02:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
problems other questions rep uh
 
02:14:50.549 --> 02:14:50.559 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas and then
 
02:14:50.559 --> 02:14:52.830 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas and then
representative

02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:14:55.069 --> 02:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:14:57.549 --> 02:14:57.559 align:start position:0%
for being here and taking my question um
 
02:15:01.750 --> 02:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in your um opinion about
 
02:15:03.430 --> 02:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
um so-called
 
02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
cherry-picking when um the free
 
02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:08.709 align:start position:0%
cherry-picking when um the free
market

02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
market
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
um uh results in um facilities that
 
02:15:19.229 --> 02:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
provide uh care basically to a healthier
 
02:15:22.549 --> 02:15:22.559 align:start position:0%
better insured population
 
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
and then leaving the higher Acuity by
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
necessary more expensive care to um uh
 
02:15:34.270 --> 02:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
other facilities that take all comers
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
thank you so first of all um and if I
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
may can I just ask you um or ask the
 
02:15:42.549 --> 02:15:42.559 align:start position:0%
representative Mr chairman are you
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with the surgery center of
 
02:15:49.549 --> 02:15:49.559 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma I'm not okay I would recommend
 
02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
the committee uh as an example of an
 
02:15:55.870 --> 02:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
institution that works with strong price
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
transparency to take a look at the
 
02:16:00.549 --> 02:16:00.559 align:start position:0%
website for the surgery City of Oklahoma
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
where they publish pricing for a variety
 
02:16:02.639 --> 02:16:03.510 align:start position:0%
where they publish pricing for a variety
of

02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:16:06.549 --> 02:16:06.559 align:start position:0%
procedures and I grant you that that
 
02:16:08.669 --> 02:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
particular example is an example of an
 
02:16:12.229 --> 02:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
institution that does not provide every
 
02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
possible Health Care
 
02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:16.069 align:start position:0%
possible Health Care
procedure

02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
02:16:19.189 --> 02:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh but I think it is instructive when
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
you look at that to to be able to
 
02:16:24.069 --> 02:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
compare the pricing for those procedures
 
02:16:26.830 --> 02:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
that it does service to the pricing for
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
those procedures that you see from our
 
02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals here in state and so back to
 
02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
your question do I believe that we have
 
02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
healthc care institutions
 
02:16:42.030 --> 02:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
today that are increasing the price
 
02:16:44.589 --> 02:16:44.599 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily on one procedure in order to
 
02:16:46.910 --> 02:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
subsidize another procedure yes I do and
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
I find that to be uh in contravention of
 
02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
our laws both our state laws and our
 
02:16:55.070 --> 02:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
federal laws and we should be holding
 
02:16:57.709 --> 02:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
them to account for that that is not to
 
02:17:01.230 --> 02:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
say that we should not be charging more
 
02:17:04.469 --> 02:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
for an emergency procedure than for a
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
procedure which is scheduled a month in
 
02:17:09.629 --> 02:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
advance in the middle of a weekday but
 
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
it is to say that when we have one
 
02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:14.070 align:start position:0%
it is to say that when we have one
person

02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
forced to subsidize
 
02:17:21.870 --> 02:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
another that in of itself is a violation
 
02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
of our antitrust laws and I would argue
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
that the words that we should be using
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
around that include words like
 
02:17:34.190 --> 02:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
fraud representative
 
02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um it is within
 
02:17:46.230 --> 02:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's purview to go and
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
investigate fraud um you know if it
 
02:17:52.429 --> 02:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
exists but it's not within the Attorney
 
02:17:56.549 --> 02:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
General's purview um to maybe go in and
 
02:17:59.669 --> 02:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
investigate you know the basic structure
 
02:18:01.830 --> 02:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
um there are other agencies that kind of
 
02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
do that but if there is fraud it's
 
02:18:06.589 --> 02:18:06.599 align:start position:0%
definitely um within his purview to go
 
02:18:11.709 --> 02:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
after it so um but this
 
02:18:14.270 --> 02:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
resolution kind of
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
presupposes that a lot of what's
 
02:18:21.910 --> 02:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
driving um the the High pricing is
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
indeed fraud antitrust things of that
 
02:18:25.950 --> 02:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
nature at least as I read it it's kind
 
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
of implied in in the findings in in the
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
resolution so I'm just wondering you
 
02:18:33.950 --> 02:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
know not knowing for sure that it is
 
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
fraud but maybe it is just a structural
 
02:18:40.629 --> 02:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
problem on what because we we don't just
 
02:18:42.509 --> 02:18:42.519 align:start position:0%
investigate organizations there has to
 
02:18:46.750 --> 02:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
be a crime to just so on what basis on
 
02:18:50.030 --> 02:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
what legal basis um do you think the
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
Attorney General
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
can can proceed do you think there is
 
02:18:55.349 --> 02:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
enough with this to proceed are there
 
02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
other states um that have gone forward
 
02:19:00.309 --> 02:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
and and you know we're going to open up
 
02:19:03.589 --> 02:19:03.599 align:start position:0%
an investigation because yes we think
 
02:19:06.669 --> 02:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
that it is fraud and so I guess I'm just
 
02:19:10.110 --> 02:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm asking the question poorly but
 
02:19:12.990 --> 02:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
what is the ba the legal basis upon
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
which he could initiate the
 
02:19:17.669 --> 02:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
investigation um and where do you see
 
02:19:21.030 --> 02:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
that within this resolution okay so I
 
02:19:22.190 --> 02:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of questions that
 
02:19:24.230 --> 02:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
you asked in there but I I'll I'll try
 
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
and respond to the gist of of what I
 
02:19:29.070 --> 02:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
understand them to be first of all the
 
02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is not uh unable to
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
investigate entities before he has
 
02:19:38.190 --> 02:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
determined that there is a crime that
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
has occurred to the contrary that's the
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
point of our judicial system is to
 
02:19:43.709 --> 02:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
determine whether there's a crime that's
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
occurred the Attorney General can choose
 
02:19:50.910 --> 02:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
to investigate based upon uh suspicion
 
02:19:54.429 --> 02:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
cause and so forth and um not merely a
 
02:19:57.309 --> 02:19:57.319 align:start position:0%
fraud we have an entire chapter in our
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
statutes here in New Hampshire that
 
02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
addresses antitrust law and so what I'm
 
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
suggesting in this resolution is not
 
02:20:06.790 --> 02:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
that out of the gate he should just go
 
02:20:09.230 --> 02:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
and start Prosecuting people I am
 
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting that he should investigate
 
02:20:14.670 --> 02:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
and turn some attention to this matter
 
02:20:16.750 --> 02:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
and if he finds cause to do so then yes
 
02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
of course he should take action um those
 
02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:21.150 align:start position:0%
of course he should take action um those
actions

02:20:21.150 --> 02:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
actions
 
02:20:24.389 --> 02:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
are uh literally what that office does
 
02:20:27.150 --> 02:20:27.160 align:start position:0%
every day and I don't think that there's
 
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
anything in what I'm putting forward
 
02:20:33.389 --> 02:20:33.399 align:start position:0%
here which limits his ability to operate
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
um in the way that he would at any other
 
02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:39.950 align:start position:0%
um in the way that he would at any other
time

02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
follow thank you very much and that's
 
02:20:44.830 --> 02:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
very Illuminating um are are you aware
 
02:20:46.830 --> 02:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
of any other states that have had
 
02:20:48.670 --> 02:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
similar resolutions and have kind of
 
02:20:51.670 --> 02:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
gone down this path and have found
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
anything substantive thank you for the
 
02:20:57.309 --> 02:20:57.319 align:start position:0%
question yeah I I am aware that since
 
02:20:59.870 --> 02:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
those Supreme Court rulings came
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
out we have and by the way they are from
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
1979 and
 
02:21:10.590 --> 02:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
1982 we have seen next to no enforcement
 
02:21:13.950 --> 02:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
of the the outcomes that follow from
 
02:21:16.950 --> 02:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
those rulings and I put it to you that
 
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
the reason we have seen that is because
 
02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
the healthcare Lobby is strong and has
 
02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
only been getting stronger and stronger
 
02:21:26.830 --> 02:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
over the last
 
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
decades thank you other questions
 
02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:31.349 align:start position:0%
decades thank you other questions
representative

02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you so much and thank you
 
02:21:35.710 --> 02:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
for the Indulgence of another question
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
and I uh understand your point which is
 
02:21:40.870 --> 02:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
well taken about matching the actual
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
costs with the actual procedure does
 
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
that mean that you would also support
 
02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
ensuring that Medicaid was well enough
 
02:21:51.070 --> 02:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
funded to pay the full amount
 
02:21:54.070 --> 02:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
of the cost of every procedure that and
 
02:21:57.190 --> 02:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
service that is rendered to Medicaid
 
02:21:59.630 --> 02:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
patients so I don't think that's Jermain
 
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
to this resolution I'm happy to have a
 
02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
conversation with you in the cafeteria
 
02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
about Medicaid and Medicare and in point
 
02:22:08.590 --> 02:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
of fact I had intended to bring a bill
 
02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
uh not unrelated to that this year but
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
again uh I didn't get to where I wanted
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
with OS but maybe we'll be talking in
 
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
another year thank you other discussion
 
02:22:21.070 --> 02:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions question
 
02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative taes hi uh thank you and
 
02:22:25.630 --> 02:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so I'm
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
a little confused um because uh part of
 
02:22:32.590 --> 02:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
what I heard you mentioned was uh
 
02:22:35.309 --> 02:22:35.319 align:start position:0%
different people or payers pay different
 
02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
rates for the same service but that is
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
sort of the foundation of how our Health
 
02:22:46.270 --> 02:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
Care system works right insurers have uh
 
02:22:48.190 --> 02:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
purchasing power and so they negotiate
 
02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
different rates for paying so so at
 
02:22:54.110 --> 02:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
least as far as the the costs of
 
02:22:55.950 --> 02:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
healthcare paid by insurance or paid by
 
02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
individuals that seems like an insurance
 
02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
issue and I'm curious why you wouldn't
 
02:23:02.870 --> 02:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
be taking it there and and also just it
 
02:23:04.990 --> 02:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
seems like the most American thing we
 
02:23:07.790 --> 02:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
have right which is uh business
 
02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
operating as business
 
02:23:14.110 --> 02:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
does so I mean first of all uh you say
 
02:23:17.389 --> 02:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
that our Health Care system works I I
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
would beg to
 
02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
differ I think that
 
02:23:23.150 --> 02:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
what you just outlined is part of the
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
problem if I pull up at a gas
 
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
station I expect to be able to fill my
 
02:23:32.309 --> 02:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
car for the posted price per gallon I do
 
02:23:35.389 --> 02:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
not expect to be questioned as to what
 
02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
car insurance I have or to have my car
 
02:23:41.070 --> 02:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
looked at to determine whether or not
 
02:23:43.309 --> 02:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
the color of the car or the the the
 
02:23:46.510 --> 02:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
model is relevant to changing the price
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
and so you know what you're talking
 
02:23:51.550 --> 02:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
about is a model model that is not based
 
02:23:54.469 --> 02:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
upon proper commercial practices where
 
02:23:57.150 --> 02:23:57.160 align:start position:0%
for example if I go to a manufacturer
 
02:23:58.990 --> 02:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
and I say I would like to purchase 100
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
widgets of X they may give me a discount
 
02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
versus if I go to purchase one
 
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
widget it is certainly cheaper for a
 
02:24:11.469 --> 02:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
health care provider or anyone
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
else any other company to sell 100 units
 
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
at the same time to the same
 
02:24:21.710 --> 02:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
person as to sell them individually to
 
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
100 different people with 100 different
 
02:24:24.750 --> 02:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances and 100 different sets of
 
02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
invoices and so forth but that is not
 
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
the case when you have
 
02:24:31.870 --> 02:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
insurers uh I know that there are
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
contracts that are structured to claim
 
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
that that is the predicate for some of
 
02:24:38.230 --> 02:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
this variable
 
02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
pricing um however that is one of the
 
02:24:42.910 --> 02:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
the issues that the Supreme Court ruled
 
02:24:46.429 --> 02:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
against and so I I think that if you
 
02:24:48.830 --> 02:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
take a look at the case law on this uh
 
02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
you will find that there is uh a case to
 
02:24:53.190 --> 02:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
be pursued here and uh look I'm not a
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
lawyer uh I I believe that the Attorney
 
02:24:57.870 --> 02:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
General is far more capable of making
 
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
those determinations that I am and uh
 
02:25:02.030 --> 02:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
that our courts are as well and I look
 
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:07.070 --> 02:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
happening so my question was it seems
 
02:25:08.830 --> 02:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
like it should be like an insurance
 
02:25:12.030 --> 02:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
department issue that was my I yes I I
 
02:25:13.030 --> 02:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
understand that and I didn't address
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
that part of your question so um one of
 
02:25:18.590 --> 02:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
the two Supreme Court cases I referenced
 
02:25:21.070 --> 02:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
the group life versus Royal drug
 
02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
uh spoke to the McCarron Ferguson act
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
which is an act that is related to
 
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
Insurance um and so to that extent I can
 
02:25:31.550 --> 02:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
understand your question saying well
 
02:25:33.750 --> 02:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
isn't this an insurance issue the
 
02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
rulings core principle applies broadly
 
02:25:38.750 --> 02:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
Healthcare markets cannot use
 
02:25:41.230 --> 02:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
exclusionary agreements to limit
 
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
competition and hr14 addresses those
 
02:25:48.870 --> 02:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive practices uh in a broad
 
02:25:51.269 --> 02:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
fashion right and and I think that uh
 
02:25:54.309 --> 02:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
any reasonable interpretation of of the
 
02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruling would understand
 
02:25:58.429 --> 02:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
that it extends to healthc care
 
02:26:01.710 --> 02:26:01.720 align:start position:0%
providers and to uh Pharmacy uh
 
02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
companies as well as it does to
 
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
insurers and and by the way the other
 
02:26:09.510 --> 02:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
ruling uh is predicated upon the Sherman
 
02:26:11.750 --> 02:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
Antitrust Act and has no insurance
 
02:26:14.309 --> 02:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
specificity to
 
02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:21.030 --> 02:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay represent I'm
 
02:26:24.670 --> 02:26:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:26.750 --> 02:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
chairman no one else has signed up to
 
02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
testify does anybody else wish
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
to seeing no one else uh that uh that is
 
02:26:35.389 --> 02:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
the last hearing we have scheduled until
 
02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
1:00 so I'm going to close the public
 
02:26:40.389 --> 02:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
hearing on hr14 will'll be in recess
 
02:26:43.710 --> 02:26:43.720 align:start position:0%

Weber thank you representative Weber for
 
03:37:01.070 --> 03:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
pin thank you thank you and I
 
03:37:03.750 --> 03:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
actually was supposed to be on this bill
 
03:37:05.950 --> 03:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
but life intervened and I didn't sign
 
03:37:09.269 --> 03:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
off in the right amount of time the bill
 
03:37:12.030 --> 03:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
came out of reporting which is done to
 
03:37:14.070 --> 03:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services oversight
 
03:37:16.670 --> 03:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
committee for the the relatively
 
03:37:20.790 --> 03:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
recently established um
 
03:37:20.800 --> 03:37:22.630 align:start position:0%
recently established um
um

03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:25.710 --> 03:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
enhanced provision of services
 
03:37:28.950 --> 03:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
for uh pregnant women we extended the
 
03:37:31.670 --> 03:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
time and we when we extended the time we
 
03:37:34.950 --> 03:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
also required quarterly reporting on
 
03:37:34.960 --> 03:37:35.790 align:start position:0%
also required quarterly reporting on
that

03:37:35.790 --> 03:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:37:41.030 --> 03:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
program and I think that the purpose of
 
03:37:46.830 --> 03:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
this uh legislation is simply to
 
03:37:51.309 --> 03:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
um repeal the quarterly reporting
 
03:37:56.309 --> 03:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:58.990 --> 03:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
2025 um
 
03:38:01.670 --> 03:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
so because it was felt that the program
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
is established we don't need to have
 
03:38:06.590 --> 03:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
quite as many reports so uh that's the
 
03:38:08.710 --> 03:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
entire import of the bill and I would
 
03:38:12.590 --> 03:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
defer to Mr Lipman on U any questions
 
03:38:15.870 --> 03:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
you might have but it was a request of
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
various members of the Health and Human
 
03:38:19.950 --> 03:38:19.960 align:start position:0%

03:38:19.960 --> 03:38:25.550 align:start position:0%

03:38:25.550 --> 03:38:25.560 align:start position:0%

much good afternoon Mr Litman welcome
 
03:38:31.110 --> 03:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
back thank you uh chairman and members
 
03:38:33.590 --> 03:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee U Henry Litman State's
 
03:38:36.229 --> 03:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director and this came out of a
 
03:38:39.630 --> 03:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
discussion at as was mentioned at Health
 
03:38:42.710 --> 03:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
and Human Services oversight um the way
 
03:38:44.790 --> 03:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
the original legislation was enacted it
 
03:38:47.229 --> 03:38:47.239 align:start position:0%
was a forever reporting I think this is
 
03:38:50.030 --> 03:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
saying to and I think this actually came
 
03:38:52.750 --> 03:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
at uh representative Edwards suggestion
 
03:38:54.670 --> 03:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
was to have some end point of the
 
03:38:57.630 --> 03:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
quarterly reporting and that is um at
 
03:39:00.630 --> 03:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
the end of the bium um
 
03:39:04.070 --> 03:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
2027 and we we supported his suggestion
 
03:39:06.670 --> 03:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
and would appreciate if you would enact
 
03:39:09.070 --> 03:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
this okay so the department does support
 
03:39:11.750 --> 03:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
the bill yes okay are there any
 
03:39:13.910 --> 03:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
questions for yes representative mlan
 
03:39:15.950 --> 03:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative w
 
03:39:18.309 --> 03:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry all right gentlemen who
 
03:39:21.309 --> 03:39:21.319 align:start position:0%
wants to go first representative Woods
 
03:39:22.510 --> 03:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:39:26.229 --> 03:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is U just a um
 
03:39:29.110 --> 03:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps exposing my ignorance um uh
 
03:39:33.150 --> 03:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
number two uh uh section two repeals RSA
 
03:39:36.309 --> 03:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
such and such uh but section one uh
 
03:39:39.110 --> 03:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
usually it says after such and such
 
03:39:41.950 --> 03:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
insert the following or da D nothing is
 
03:39:45.790 --> 03:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
inserted so it almost looks like the
 
03:39:49.309 --> 03:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
repeal takes place and the reporting is
 
03:39:52.950 --> 03:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh that was there is Del is
 
03:39:55.469 --> 03:39:55.479 align:start position:0%
deleted but the paragraph above it
 
03:39:59.590 --> 03:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't say to insert it in a particular
 
03:40:03.710 --> 03:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
place and um almost as if it you know it
 
03:40:04.990 --> 03:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
seems like there should be some
 
03:40:08.590 --> 03:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
reference to installing that reporting
 
03:40:11.070 --> 03:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place and I may just be
 
03:40:13.710 --> 03:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:16.189 --> 03:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
incorrectly I believe
 
03:40:20.830 --> 03:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
believe that the language up at the top
 
03:40:25.070 --> 03:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
is the existing language of
 
03:40:28.309 --> 03:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
4D which is what would be repealed and
 
03:40:30.269 --> 03:40:30.279 align:start position:0%
the reason it's not in bold is because
 
03:40:32.309 --> 03:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
it's already in
 
03:40:37.150 --> 03:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:40.389 --> 03:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
D um although it does have a different
 
03:40:45.349 --> 03:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
date it starts at 2024 so um I'm not
 
03:40:49.030 --> 03:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
sure about the fact that there is no
 
03:40:52.030 --> 03:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
reference for insertion on the first
 
03:40:54.590 --> 03:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
part and I'd be glad to go and check OS
 
03:40:57.910 --> 03:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
about that I know I have gotten
 
03:41:02.389 --> 03:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
into muddles before with repeal dates
 
03:41:05.870 --> 03:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
because you have the statute and then
 
03:41:07.990 --> 03:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
you have the effective clause and then
 
03:41:09.910 --> 03:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
you have the repeal dates and they're
 
03:41:13.030 --> 03:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
all in different places uh I think this
 
03:41:14.950 --> 03:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
one's okay but I'd be more than glad to
 
03:41:17.269 --> 03:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
go check on it to make sure it does
 
03:41:20.110 --> 03:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
here's the RSA that's what's wanted
 
03:41:21.510 --> 03:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's being
 
03:41:26.309 --> 03:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:31.189 --> 03:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
and and it does not say that section one
 
03:41:34.510 --> 03:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
replaces yeah that's which I think we
 
03:41:36.670 --> 03:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
may need yeah that was my
 
03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
question so I will undertake to find out
 
03:41:43.550 --> 03:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
about that okay thank or bring it or
 
03:41:45.990 --> 03:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
bring an explanation for the executive
 
03:41:47.990 --> 03:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
session you said it more concisely that
 
03:41:51.110 --> 03:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
some replacing would be
 
03:41:53.189 --> 03:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
the representative mlan and then
 
03:41:53.199 --> 03:41:54.469 align:start position:0%
the representative mlan and then
representative

03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:41:56.550 --> 03:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
Maser thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:41:59.229 --> 03:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um it looks like
 
03:42:03.429 --> 03:42:03.439 align:start position:0%
they're going to uh Sunset the report so
 
03:42:06.269 --> 03:42:06.279 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm trying to understand is
 
03:42:09.189 --> 03:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
um is because I'm not familiar with
 
03:42:10.990 --> 03:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
these quarterly reports are these
 
03:42:14.189 --> 03:42:14.199 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports common in other areas
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
um to do TR in and um is it normal that
 
03:42:22.269 --> 03:42:22.279 align:start position:0%
they just kind of like have a shelf life
 
03:42:24.630 --> 03:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
and that they sunset uh I'm just trying
 
03:42:26.469 --> 03:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
to get to you know what is normally the
 
03:42:28.429 --> 03:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
scope of these corly reports and do they
 
03:42:33.309 --> 03:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
Sunset so I for the Medicaid Program um
 
03:42:35.870 --> 03:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
can speak to that what I'm responsible
 
03:42:38.550 --> 03:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
for I believe right now it's this is the
 
03:42:40.670 --> 03:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
only report that I have to hh's
 
03:42:42.389 --> 03:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
oversight that's a required
 
03:42:45.510 --> 03:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
legislatively so I think historically um
 
03:42:47.630 --> 03:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
when the postpartum coverage part of the
 
03:42:47.640 --> 03:42:48.990 align:start position:0%
when the postpartum coverage part of the
Omnibus

03:42:48.990 --> 03:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
Omnibus
 
03:42:51.550 --> 03:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
1.0 um initiative there was interest to
 
03:42:53.670 --> 03:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that the department timely
 
03:42:56.870 --> 03:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
sought the um state plan amendment to be
 
03:42:59.550 --> 03:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
able to to provide that coverage which
 
03:43:02.030 --> 03:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
we we did so that was one part of the
 
03:43:04.910 --> 03:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
report which we can say every quarter
 
03:43:08.349 --> 03:43:08.359 align:start position:0%
that back in October we got this in 2023
 
03:43:11.630 --> 03:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
and so that part is really per P that
 
03:43:14.990 --> 03:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
the part now is to see whether um how
 
03:43:16.469 --> 03:43:16.479 align:start position:0%
the the benefit is being used and
 
03:43:18.149 --> 03:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
whether people are getting access to it
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
and I think you know reporting Forever
 
03:43:23.790 --> 03:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
on it I think is part of an
 
03:43:25.830 --> 03:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
issue representative Maser and then
 
03:43:28.189 --> 03:43:28.199 align:start position:0%
representative Weber yes thank you Mr
 
03:43:31.349 --> 03:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
chair so kind of following up with what
 
03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative mlan asked is I can see
 
03:43:39.309 --> 03:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
you know a a a change to the the
 
03:43:42.510 --> 03:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
reporting not being quarterly but why
 
03:43:45.510 --> 03:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
not make it at least like once a year or
 
03:43:48.630 --> 03:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
or twice a year because it correct me if
 
03:43:51.110 --> 03:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong is is it is it a isn't it
 
03:43:53.469 --> 03:43:53.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be a worthwhile report so we
 
03:43:55.750 --> 03:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
do think it's worthwhile to do on a
 
03:44:00.110 --> 03:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis um for a period of time
 
03:44:02.710 --> 03:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
as opposed to having a quarterly report
 
03:44:07.830 --> 03:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:11.389 --> 03:44:11.399 align:start position:0%
will set kind of Representative
 
03:44:14.469 --> 03:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
Weber uh this isn't actually a question
 
03:44:16.070 --> 03:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
but I can put in a question if you'd
 
03:44:18.110 --> 03:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
like me to but I know why it's drafted
 
03:44:20.790 --> 03:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
this way now I figured it out my guess
 
03:44:24.030 --> 03:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
is that because section D was a
 
03:44:27.110 --> 03:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
permanent reporting requirement it was
 
03:44:28.590 --> 03:44:28.600 align:start position:0%
put in the
 
03:44:32.429 --> 03:44:32.439 align:start position:0%
statute because what we replacing it
 
03:44:36.870 --> 03:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
with is a temporary reporting
 
03:44:40.070 --> 03:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
requirement it would only go into
 
03:44:42.910 --> 03:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
chapter law it would not go into the
 
03:44:47.229 --> 03:44:47.239 align:start position:0%
statute and um so what this is doing is
 
03:44:50.550 --> 03:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
repealing D which is in the statute in
 
03:44:54.630 --> 03:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
its entirety but the part that isn't
 
03:44:57.389 --> 03:44:57.399 align:start position:0%
inserted in the statutes in any
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
particular place becomes part of chapter
 
03:45:03.070 --> 03:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
law and it's a requirement but chapter
 
03:45:06.990 --> 03:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
law is used often when it's a temporary
 
03:45:08.149 --> 03:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
thing that's
 
03:45:11.590 --> 03:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
happening that doesn't need to be a part
 
03:45:16.510 --> 03:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
of the statute so that's my guess I will
 
03:45:19.110 --> 03:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
I will find out about
 
03:45:22.790 --> 03:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
that right right the law is that which
 
03:45:26.429 --> 03:45:26.439 align:start position:0%
is boldly asserted and plausibly
 
03:45:28.990 --> 03:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
maintain so and thank you very much for
 
03:45:31.309 --> 03:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question so so I can
 
03:45:32.990 --> 03:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
understand um you have had other
 
03:45:35.389 --> 03:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports they have sunsetted if
 
03:45:37.189 --> 03:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
things have come along and this is the
 
03:45:39.149 --> 03:45:39.159 align:start position:0%
only one that remains and it like the
 
03:45:41.830 --> 03:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
other ones is going to Sunset with all
 
03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
these reports though being sunset
 
03:45:47.830 --> 03:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
um maybe you're not making reports but
 
03:45:51.229 --> 03:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
do you have things in place now that are
 
03:45:54.429 --> 03:45:54.439 align:start position:0%
continuing to track once we go beyond
 
03:45:56.750 --> 03:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
these sunsets the efficacy of these
 
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
programs um and are they reported out at
 
03:46:02.790 --> 03:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
sometime or this is just data you're
 
03:46:04.710 --> 03:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
collecting so I'm just trying to
 
03:46:07.030 --> 03:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
understand what survives beyond all
 
03:46:08.269 --> 03:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
these quarterly
 
03:46:10.630 --> 03:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
reports so I think in terms of the
 
03:46:12.389 --> 03:46:12.399 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Service oversight
 
03:46:15.229 --> 03:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
committee anything they're interested in
 
03:46:18.309 --> 03:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
um we come and make a presentation on so
 
03:46:21.990 --> 03:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
for example um the adult Dental benefit
 
03:46:23.870 --> 03:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
implementation that's something there
 
03:46:26.030 --> 03:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't a required report but it was of
 
03:46:28.070 --> 03:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
interest to track what was going on and
 
03:46:31.389 --> 03:46:31.399 align:start position:0%
we report on um the the unwind of
 
03:46:33.630 --> 03:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
continuous coverage um that was
 
03:46:35.990 --> 03:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
something that we reported regularly for
 
03:46:38.389 --> 03:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
a period of time till that was completed
 
03:46:41.950 --> 03:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
um I imagine if um legislation passes
 
03:46:44.910 --> 03:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
this session about um you know the
 
03:46:47.309 --> 03:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
Governor's budget related to um
 
03:46:49.469 --> 03:46:49.479 align:start position:0%
eligibility or premiums or what have you
 
03:46:51.790 --> 03:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
that that would be something that they
 
03:46:54.110 --> 03:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
would expect us to speak to them about
 
03:46:57.590 --> 03:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
um new waivers um it's really at the
 
03:47:00.710 --> 03:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
discretion of the chair um uh and the
 
03:47:03.429 --> 03:47:03.439 align:start position:0%
committee will will report what they we
 
03:47:04.790 --> 03:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
want to keep them informed the way they
 
03:47:08.269 --> 03:47:08.279 align:start position:0%
want to be kept informed follow so and
 
03:47:10.590 --> 03:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify so you're not going
 
03:47:13.229 --> 03:47:13.239 align:start position:0%
to be making any reports outside of a
 
03:47:15.429 --> 03:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
request but you are Contin continuing to
 
03:47:18.269 --> 03:47:18.279 align:start position:0%
gather all the data so that if a
 
03:47:20.189 --> 03:47:20.199 align:start position:0%
question should Arise at some point in
 
03:47:22.349 --> 03:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
the future you have access to that data
 
03:47:24.550 --> 03:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
to generate a report kind of on demand
 
03:47:26.590 --> 03:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
yeah pretty much I mean I think if they
 
03:47:28.870 --> 03:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
had something esoteric that I mean what
 
03:47:30.630 --> 03:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
we're what we're trying to look at here
 
03:47:33.510 --> 03:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
is you know are women taking advantage
 
03:47:36.429 --> 03:47:36.439 align:start position:0%
of this um so we look at eligibility and
 
03:47:39.229 --> 03:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
see people being enrolled and then the
 
03:47:41.429 --> 03:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
purpose of extending Beyond 60 days to a
 
03:47:44.229 --> 03:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
year was to make sure that um you know
 
03:47:45.229 --> 03:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
it's hard to get get medical
 
03:47:47.070 --> 03:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
appointments done in 60 days in this
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
environment but you know what types of

we discussed at our last meeting so to
 
03:48:35.269 --> 03:48:35.279 align:start position:0%

Weber and I will ask this one the form
 
03:48:46.750 --> 03:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
of question isn't it true that when we

03:48:54.309 --> 03:48:54.319 align:start position:0%

03:48:56.149 --> 03:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
Governor's program so it was not in
 
03:48:58.670 --> 03:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
statute but it's true isn't it that you

reported to the committee the oversight
 
03:49:04.149 --> 03:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
commission oversight committee once a
 
03:49:06.550 --> 03:49:06.560 align:start position:0%

were meeting on Monday uh and uh on a
 
03:50:10.710 --> 03:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
couple of bills that are expected to get
 
03:50:13.469 --> 03:50:13.479 align:start position:0%
a big crowd that's why they they got put
 
03:50:15.389 --> 03:50:15.399 align:start position:0%
on their own day
 
03:50:17.790 --> 03:50:17.800 align:start position:0%

schedule on Wednesday at which time
 
03:50:21.070 --> 03:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
there will be some executive session
 
03:50:23.830 --> 03:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
issues as well any questions before
 
03:50:25.950 --> 03:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
representative Woods uh yeah um was
 
03:50:29.070 --> 03:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
there any concern I when I saw the type
 
03:50:32.590 --> 03:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
of bills uh any concern that they might
 
03:50:34.830 --> 03:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
be wise to move it to
 
03:50:38.149 --> 03:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
repol there will be an overflow room too
 
03:50:39.429 --> 03:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
that was raised and they're they're
 
03:50:40.670 --> 03:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:50:42.830 --> 03:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
discourage hearings and representatives
 
03:50:44.750 --> 03:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hall yeah cuz I would anticipate I
 
03:50:46.590 --> 03:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
raised that question myself with with
 
03:50:49.469 --> 03:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
the staff and so forth
 
03:50:51.790 --> 03:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
um for a number of reasons they would
 
03:50:53.990 --> 03:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
prefer to try to do it in a double room
 
03:50:58.070 --> 03:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
with an overflow room uh also I've given
 
03:51:00.149 --> 03:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
the nature of these bills we never know
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
what the nature of the crowd will be the
 
03:51:04.510 --> 03:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
size of the crowd will be and I've also
 
03:51:07.110 --> 03:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
expressed some concerns that there' be
 
03:51:09.990 --> 03:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
security also so in the event it's
 
03:51:12.349 --> 03:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
necessary not that I expect anyone to be
 
03:51:14.710 --> 03:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
physically endangered or anything but
 
03:51:16.910 --> 03:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
just in terms of crowd control and stuff
 
03:51:19.950 --> 03:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
like that so just a question sure I
 
03:51:21.229 --> 03:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
expect a big
 
03:51:25.510 --> 03:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
crowd any U any other questions or if
 
03:51:28.550 --> 03:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
not I will we'll adjourn and again I'll
 
03:51:30.110 --> 03:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
see those of you who can make it on
 
03:51:32.389 --> 03:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
Monday or I'll see you next Wednesday
 
03:51:51.550 --> 03:51:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:55.030 --> 03:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
I think I think I think I think I'm okay
 
03:51:58.110 --> 03:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
with it as long as they keep data which
 
03:52:13.510 --> 03:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
