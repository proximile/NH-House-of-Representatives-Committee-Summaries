and I'm glad to be with you
 
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
today I come from a large family my
 
00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 align:start position:0%
father was one of 12 children in the
 
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
Next Generation there were 26 first
 
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
cousins most of us lived in the same
 
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
immediate area so when it comes to a
 
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
situation that involves an individual
 
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
ual I don't just know of such people I'm
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
probably closely related in one or more
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
of them the joke in the family was we
 
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
occupy many chapters in
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
DSM my cousin David was not as blessed
 
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
as some of us and that he did not have a
 
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
natural ability to read nor did he have
 
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
parents who read to him when he was
 
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
young and like myself and many of our
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
first cousins who entered the first
 
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
grade able to read read and that was
 
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
with no kindergarten in our area David
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
did not learn to read even in the first
 
00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 align:start position:0%
grade because there was neither remidial
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
reading Specialists nor the desire to
 
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
hold a student back nor any good kind of
 
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
program to help him David was passed
 
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
along through the system harming him
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
throughout his time in school and
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
throughout life it caused him trouble
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
much of his life and it cost the state
 
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.029 align:start position:0%
much of his life and it cost the state
some

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
money many New Hampshire school systems
 
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
public charter private and most
 
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
homeschool families are already doing a
 
00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 align:start position:0%
good job readying youngsters for the
 
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
first grade in what
 
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
follows the desire behind the proponents
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
of HV
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
671 is to close any gaps this is similar
 
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
to my family situation most of us could
 
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
read David could not but most school
 
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
systems are doing a good job teaching
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
young people to read There are however
 
00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
some gaps some towns could use help in
 
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
this or that others in Reading Readiness
 
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
there was no judgments made at least
 
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.749 align:start position:0%
there was no judgments made at least
from

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
me should this bill be passed in a
 
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
kindergarten literacy read Readiness
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
program be established where needed
 
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
reporting of the results is mandated in
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
other words is what we've established
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
doing the job we desire are more people
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
entering first grade able to read are
 
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
there noticeable improvements where
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
improvements have been
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
needed this bill in some ways is a
 
00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
placeholder because it appropriates a
 
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
dollar it says while the details are
 
00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
being worked out should the details seem
 
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
wise to the governor and executive
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
counsel they would then proceed to fund
 
00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
it with whatever monies are available as
 
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
they choose and we know that in lean
 
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
years as well as flush years sometimes
 
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
money can be
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
found it's kind of a cliche in the
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislature that we should do this or
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
that for the
 
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
children but sometimes that saying is
 
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.390 align:start position:0%
children but sometimes that saying is
very

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
apropo such a program would have changed
 
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
the course of my cousin David's life and
 
00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
it may well help in a positive way the
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
journeys of numbers of youngsters in New
 
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you Mr
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you very much for being
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
here with this uh legislation uh
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
committee represent s thank you very
 
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
much and thank you for taking my
 
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
question um as a former kindergarten
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
teacher who taught reading to my
 
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
kindergarteners um I'm just trying to
 
00:08:58.509 --> 00:08:58.519 align:start position:0%
understand how this I I understand the
 
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
goal of why you know why we need a
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
program I I just don't see in what's
 
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
written here how and I'm wondering if
 
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
you might be able to elaborate a little
 
00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:09.320 align:start position:0%
bit on on like what the program itself
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
is and how it
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
works I think the pro I think the bill
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
is theoretical and aspirational it has
 
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
recognized a problem here and there and
 
00:09:22.069 --> 00:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill according to the
 
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:26.200 align:start position:0%
folks who got behind me to put it in is
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
when we acknowledge that then uh we or
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
they can start developing a program or
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
more likely make use of a program that
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
has borne fruit elsewhere then once that
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
is in place they can go hat in hand and
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
ask for some money so it isn't as well
 
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
developed is some of the bills that I've
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
written or certainly as a chairman I've
 
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
seen but it's a first
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
step follow up yes thank you and so in
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
um section two it it says the
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
kindergarten literacy Readiness program
 
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
is a Statewide program that uses a
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
homebased or center-based educational
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
technology program etc etc is there a
 
00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:11.959 align:start position:0%
specific program that you've already
 
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
identified that reflects
 
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
this homebased educa or center-based
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
educational technology program it is my
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
understanding that they are looking at a
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
whole variety along the way to finding
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
um one that they think may be the best
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
one to start with as they say we're
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
several they are several steps behind
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
where a lot of bills come in
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
at representative Hall thank you Mr
 
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
question could you uh expand on that and
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
tell us who
 
00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:47.639 align:start position:0%
they are you just said they are
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
developing thinking about the program
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
they the person who encouraged me to put
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
this in is a lobbyist named Karen
 
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
Rosenberger and I was hoping she would
 
00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
be here today I do not see her um maybe
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
there are people here who know way more
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
about it than I do which is not a high
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
bar so thank you for
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
coming thank you I'm gra maray thank you
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
Mr Taran thank you for taking my
 
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
question um I I'm curious to um know a
 
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
little bit more about the understanding
 
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
between um preschool childhood
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
development emerging reading play based
 
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
learning and gross motor skills and how
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
you would Envision that interfacing with
 
00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:41.959 align:start position:0%
the requirement for a child to navigate
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
a platform a technology
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
program if you could tell me a little
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
bit more about sitting a four-year-old
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
down in front of the computer that in
 
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.750 align:start position:0%
down in front of the computer that in
that

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
way this will be this will be a very
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
typical liberal arts answer from me and
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
that is um good things that are already
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
going on in the
 
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
classroom anything that's added from
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
this would not be at the expense of if
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
they're doing good things there fine
 
00:12:14.829 --> 00:12:14.839 align:start position:0%
this is about identifying places where
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
help and reading is needed as
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
well followup yes uh thank you Mr shair
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
and and in addition to that um would
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
this be a complement to formative and
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
summative assessment that is already
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
happening in a classroom that educators
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
are developing relationships with their
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
the students and then making other types
 
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
of Assessments with can you tell me how
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
that might work if I understand the
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
question correctly areas where there is
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
needed more help in teaching people to
 
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
read would be
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
introduced I did not in my conversations
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
with um
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
Miss Rosenberg hear anything like we're
 
00:13:04.189 --> 00:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
going in and clean that place up it was
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
quite the contrary it was those programs
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
may actually be doing very very well in
 
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
certain other things where there is Need
 
00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
for additional assistance in helping
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
people learn to read those things would
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
come in and the Assumption I took
 
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
away was again it wouldn't be slash and
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
burn it wouldn't be everything you're
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
doing is wrong it would be here's
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
help but as I also said this is
 
00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
really I wasn't given language that says
 
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
we've got it all figured out we just
 
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
want you to fund it they're still trying
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
to figure out of the various programs
 
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
that have borne good fruit around which
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
one would they consider being the one
 
00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
that is being
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
offered resident woodcock
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good morning
 
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:02.839 align:start position:0%
represent sir thank you for taking my
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
question the chair allows I have two but
 
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
I'll start with the one that most
 
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
interest to me is um under under line 24
 
00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:13.959 align:start position:0%
has the educational technology provider
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
is a reged nonprofit
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
organization I just find that kind of
 
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
limiting it would seem to me that there
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
would be a host of educational
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
technology providers that are uh not
 
00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily registered as a nonprofit I
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know why you it's specified like
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
that I don't either again this will be a
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
question for the people who are much
 
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
closer to whatever program is being
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
desired thank you Mr chairman PA up yes
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
yeah well a question yes yes thank you
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
sir um the second part I'm looking at uh
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
line 16 when it talks about homebased U
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
me obviously me the program for children
 
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
home as it say in the definition I'm
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how that would
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
occur if I'm a homeschool youngster um
 
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
and how how is that going to happen I do
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
know through um a family member who is
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
active in The Homeschool movement that
 
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.310 align:start position:0%
active in The Homeschool movement that
many

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
homeschool or homeschool
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
co-ops uh do very well in many things
 
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.030 align:start position:0%
co-ops uh do very well in many things
but

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
are not good in some other things I also
 
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
know from this that numbers of
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers on certain things will
 
00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:34.519 align:start position:0%
combine with other homeschooled parents
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
I have a staff member who has done that
 
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of science what she and her
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
husband do um they believe is quite
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
adequate it seems to be so except in
 
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
science so they've gathered a number of
 
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
homeschooling parents who are the same
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
we don't know science and they have
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
formed a cooperative and brought in a
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
retired person who has a master's degree
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
in science to teach those kids science
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
my assumption would be if this um lack
 
00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:04.150 align:start position:0%
my assumption would be if this um lack
of

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
reading is in a homeschooling situation
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
they would do something like that thank
 
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
you thank you at least that's what I'd
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
recommend to
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
them represent Mur um thank you Mr chair
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
and thanks again for taking my question
 
00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
on page I believe that's uh page one on
 
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
lines 29 I there's a reference to tier
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
one benchmarks and are you referring to
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
to response to intervention tier one uh
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
benchmarks or are you referring to
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
something else it's not quite clear I do
 
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:40.629 align:start position:0%
something else it's not quite clear I do
not

00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%

00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
Waterford upstart has already proven its
 
00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
impact during the 2324 school year over
 
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
300 children across the state
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
participated in our program achieving
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
remarkable results on average children
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
demonstrated significant growth in early
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
literacy skills as measured by our pre-
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
and post-program assessments most
 
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
importantly many participants finished
 
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
the program with skills at or above the
 
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.240 align:start position:0%

them on a path for long-term academic
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
success HB 671 aligns closely with our
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
mission and a proven approach by
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
establishing a Statewide kindergarten
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
literacy Readiness program this bill
 
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
will ensure that every four and
 
00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
5-year-old in New Hampshire has access
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
to highquality evidence-based Early
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
Learning Resources the proposed program
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
mirrors what Waterford upstart has
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
successfully implemented already in New
 
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and across the country some
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
examples of this include personalized
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
learning where children can engage in an
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
Adaptive curriculum that focuses on
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
reading math and science for just 15 to
 
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
30 minutes a day 5 days a week it
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
includes family empowerment where
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
parents and caregivers are supported
 
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
with multilingual coaching and resources
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
to actively participate in their child's
 
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
education offers technology access for
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
families who lack the necessary tools
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
where computers or tablets and even
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
internet connectivity can be provided
 
00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
which break down barriers to
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
participation the outcomes speak for
 
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
themselves research consistently shows
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
that children who engage with Waterford
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
upstart are better prepared for
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
kindergarten which leads to improved
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
performance throughout their academic
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
Journey furthermore these results are
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
consistent across demographics including
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
children from underserved and Rural
 
00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
communities HB 671 is an opportunity to
 
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
build on these successes and scale them
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide by investing in this program
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can lead the way in
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
addressing Early Learning disparities
 
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
Empowering Families and setting children
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
up for lifelong success on behalf of
 
00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:15.559 align:start position:0%
waterford.org I commend representative
 
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
Pearson and the other sponsors of this
 
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
bill for their leadership on this
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
critical issue I urge this committee to
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
pass HB 671 and to support its
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
implementation so that more children and
 
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
families can benefit from programs like
 
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
water upstart and I thank the chair and
 
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:32.840 align:start position:0%

go ahead then we can um bery Shore um
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
was hired by water for up start gosh
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
right there before Co um they had
 
00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
started a program a pilot program in
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
Nashua and it was funded by the United
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
Way of nashwa the um city of nashwa and
 
00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
uh the libraries were involved I'm not
 
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
so sure there was funding there and the
 
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
purpose was to try the program in in New
 
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a pilot and as you know
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
there is a population in Manchester I
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
mean Nashville that's lower income some
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
new uh Americans refugees coming in ETC
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
so they thought let's try the program
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
the TR program was tremendously
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
successful in NASA and they really saw a
 
00:22:40.919 --> 00:22:42.390 align:start position:0%
successful in NASA and they really saw a
real

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
real
 
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
uptick in the um progress of the kids
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
and truly their Readiness to go to
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
kindergarten so they came to us and at
 
00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
this point Nash uh I mean Waterford was
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
only doing
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
homebased and so the reason they came to
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
us at Bering sure was they thought we
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
had connections around the state and the
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
bottom line was getting directly to the
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
individual family and that was the
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
question how do we get to um to the
 
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:15.799 align:start position:0%
family how do we get to representative
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
hail and say we've got a program for
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
your three-year-old or four-year-old
 
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
because it was frankly personto person
 
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
this was being it was truly homebased
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
not provider based um so we worked over
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
the course of time and it was really
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
fascinating to see um you know where you
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
found the people who had the had the
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
three year olds or four the four year
 
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
olds to go into the program the
 
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
Education um because of the success of
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
nashal worked with Waterford and got a
 
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
grant through UNH for a million and half
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
dollars to go Statewide and again we
 
00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:57.799 align:start position:0%
worked really hard Statewide but you can
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
well imag in the North Country you're
 
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
picking off one here one here and so Rob
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
got hired and I must say Rob has done an
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
unbelievably phenomenal job because I
 
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
think a lot of your background with the
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
why and early childhood education Etc so
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
the program was very successful but we
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
um we
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
did think that maybe we needed to see if
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
we could work with providers that had
 
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
been tried in other states decades ago
 
00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
and the providers are kind of said no no
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
no um you know we do this ourselves this
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
program is 15 minutes 5 days a week and
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
it there's a coach when it was Pro
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
homebased there's a coach that monitors
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
the progress and if they see a child is
 
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
soaring here and not quite doing so well
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
here they will um they will will re
 
00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
rejigger the program they will so if
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
they see a child's using it too long
 
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
call up and say what's going on and I
 
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
remember a story way back in the
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
beginning when the coach called up and
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
said it's supposed to be 15 minutes a
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
day 5 days a away for your child and the
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
child's using it 2 hours a day well it
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
turns out it was a family that the
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
parents did not speak great English
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
English was a second language the
 
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
parents were using the program as well
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
and if the folks do not have an an
 
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.070 align:start position:0%
and if the folks do not have an an
internet

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
internet
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
connection Waterford pays for it if the
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
folks don't have a computer Waterford
 
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
will give them a computer or a tablet
 
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
that was part of the deal with nashwa
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
and that was part of the deal with doe
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
and the Waterford would pay for the
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
internet connection and the computer the
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
state can't because it's and um so it
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
was really it was it really incredibly
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
successful the Grant from the state ran
 
00:25:59.070 --> 00:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
out last June we had a whole group of
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
kids who were already signed up for this
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
calendar year and we couldn't do it we
 
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
still got the catch we're still waiting
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
for it and Waterford is still willing to
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
chip in their part that maybe I can't
 
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
remember which one of you over here ask
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
about the nonprofit that may be uh part
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
of the reason the nonprofit's in there
 
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
because it's a nonprofit water for was
 
00:26:24.029 --> 00:26:24.039 align:start position:0%
able to raise money to pay for the
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
computers and the and the and the
 
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
internet uh that the state the state
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
couldn't do so um we thought a program
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be established you can't fund
 
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
it if you don't have it established
 
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
which is why this bill and we know it's
 
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
a tough budget year so we thought let's
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
get the program done if it turns out at
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
the end of the day there's a million
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
bucks we'll take it and run if it's half
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
a million bucks we'll take it and run or
 
00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
there are other providers that certainly
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
can qualify and and take it run run as
 
00:27:02.909 --> 00:27:02.919 align:start position:0%
well um so what Rob did is he realized
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
there were some school districts that
 
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
had pre and went into some of the school
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
districts and there are a number of
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
school districts that now are using
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
Waterford we went to London Dairy
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
because they have opo Tobit money and
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
from our perspective if you teach a
 
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
child how to read and they can go to
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
kindergarten ready to learn to read or
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
whether they learn in the first grade I
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
mean I had want to learned it grandchild
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
who learned in the first grade and I
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
have a dyslexic child and let me tell
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
you that's a whole another ball of wax
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
but um if you can set them up for
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
success and they can eventually read by
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
the time they in third third grade the
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
trajectory of those kids being
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
successful and not dropping out and not
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
doing drugs and alcohol is terrific and
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
so that was the whole point of this is
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
to get kids so their brains are are are
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
really ready to read so we went to
 
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
London der because they got money from
 
00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:03.799 align:start position:0%
the opioid fund and we went to London
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
der and said can you use they had I like
 
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
$60,000 well London der was really
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
excited about it because they don't have
 
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
hold day kindergarten and they said to
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
Rob and Waterford well could you tailor
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
a program to use with the kindergarten
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
kits and the afternoon for 15 minutes so
 
00:28:26.669 --> 00:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
that because they don't have full day
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
kindergarten they're not falling behind
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
and of course waterfit said yes of
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
course they went to the H's office asked
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
for the money and the H's office said no
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
you know we we're giving the money after
 
00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
they got the problem and you're thinking
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
whoa there's one little line that says
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
prevention but you know whatever so you
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
know from our perspective it's a
 
00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:48.789 align:start position:0%
know from our perspective it's a
prevention

00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:51.399 align:start position:0%
program whether the state continues to
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
use water for or someone else we just
 
00:28:57.149 --> 00:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to put it on the bucks so there's
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
the opportunity if ever there is money
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
it's been tremendously successful
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
private providers are using it school
 
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
districts are using it and their home
 
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
schoolers are using it and some people
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
who just are doing day when I say
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
daycare daycare themselves at home are
 
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
using it and the the number the numbers
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
are great I'm going to hand you out
 
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
three letters um each program no matter
 
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's a provider program or an at
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
home program has a coach so the coach is
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
watching and and basically saying this
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
is working we need to we need to work a
 
00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more on that and I've got
 
00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.110 align:start position:0%
little bit more on that and I've got
also

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
um I unfortunately did not bring but one
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
copy but I'll send you this too it's the
 
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
Waterford uh final report from 2324 and
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
2223 and Rob can answer technical
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
questions I can answer questions about
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
what we tried to do in New Hampshire but
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
we very proud of working with water F
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
because it really it really has helped
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
kids and it's was wonderful during Co I
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
will say again so happy to answer
 
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you for listening to
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
a little bit of my rambling but thank
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much uh
 
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
questions rident Murray um thank you Mr
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
chair I'll just wait until because it
 
00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:29.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
so I I I do have a question for you in
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
addition to the initial cohort size of
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
individuals that seems to have expanded
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
outside of the homebased program it
 
00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:42.919 align:start position:0%
seems like your initial kit is fairly um
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
malleable so like one person might need
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
just a laptop whereas one person might
 
00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
need internet connectivity and a laptop
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
or something else but my question really
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
is with regard to you mentioned um
 
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
Second Language Learners or English
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
limited proficiency um are you providing
 
00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
transcription and translation services
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
in the event that an individual or a
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
family needs those as well yes
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely so we work with a translation
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
service uh that we have coaches who
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
speak um Spanish and uh Haitian Creole
 
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
but out we work with a translation
 
00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
service that will um speak in over a 100
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
languages so if we have identified a
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
family that speaks outside of the
 
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
languages of our existing staff we will
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
coordinate with the translation service
 
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
to be on the
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
phone and we will translate all of our
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
materials into those languages for the
 
00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:35.799 align:start position:0%
families as
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
well representative Terry
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
yeah um it it it sounds to me from your
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh testimony both of you that you would
 
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
find um this piece of proposed
 
00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:52.519 align:start position:0%
legislation helpful to you uh could you
 
00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:54.039 align:start position:0%
just describe in a little bit more
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
detail how it would be helpful to you in
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
what ways it would be helpful to you and
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
and also if you are aware of uh similar
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
legislation uh in other states um that
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
may have already been enacted into law
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
this I can take part of it Rob can take
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
part of it um this is really a public
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
private partnership and so how we
 
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
envision this is that that waterfood
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
would do as it has in the past Contin to
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
contribute computers internet things
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
like the the coaches Etc and the state
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
would would be able to help Fray def
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
Fray the cost of the curriculum Etc and
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
and doing the other thing is by having
 
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
the legislation it really one it allows
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
the state to put in a little bit of
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
money and two it really gives gives it
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
um validity particularly going into some
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
of the the in the case of of schools
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
that might or towns that might want to
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
fund it and and as I said with like the
 
00:33:09.149 --> 00:33:09.159 align:start position:0%
op money you if you if we could have
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
accessed that then that would have been
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
kids that were accessed with that money
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
the London Dairy where is the state
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
money uh could help us cover cover
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
others um yes there has been legislation
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
in other states and other states it has
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
been funded by the state um
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
we are not certainly coming in here and
 
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
asking for for total funding we' really
 
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
like to continue the public private
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
partnership and Rob may want to add out
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
that uh what I would add is yes we have
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh successfully seen similar legislation
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
our upstart product itself was uh
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
created uh from legislation enacted in
 
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
uh the state of Utah uh well over a
 
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
decade ago is legislation similar to
 
00:33:56.669 --> 00:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
that is what created uh the building of
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
our software
 
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.230 align:start position:0%
our software
representative

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
C thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:34:06.909 --> 00:34:06.919 align:start position:0%
question um so it it in what I'm hearing
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
in your testimony it sounds like you
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
support this legislation because it
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
specifically uses the program that you
 
00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:14.919 align:start position:0%
represent would you still want to
 
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
support this legislation if other
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
companies programs like the creative
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
curriculum for example or which is a
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
play base that also still teaches
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
literacy skills um that was deved veled
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
in the 1970s um but if if it were not
 
00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
your program but the program of another
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
company or another founder that has
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with you 100% as a as a
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
native New Englander and as a person who
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
ass sered families in Early Education in
 
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire prior to
 
00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:47.079 align:start position:0%
coming to Waterford that is my first and
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
foremost intent behind this bill so if
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
it did not happen to benefit Waterford
 
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
um I would still stand behind this bill
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
100% res Mur thank you Mr chair and
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um we
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about SE languages
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
but we also should talk about IEPs and
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
504s and how those uh potential
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for services through your
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
program or utilizing those types of
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
things how do you envision providers
 
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
getting reimbursed for services that
 
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
this we may have to get back to you on
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
that one but I didn't know that this is
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
my ignorance I didn't know that children
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
pre school had an IEP and got services
 
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
but do they
 
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay sorry for my
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
ignorance um we would that's not
 
00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
something we have done in the state of
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but we would work
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
collaboratively um we do believe in a um
 
00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.790 align:start position:0%
collaboratively um we do believe in a um
um

00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
a scalable model so if there was an
 
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work collaboratively in
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
that effort uh we certainly would be
 
00:36:08.829 --> 00:36:08.839 align:start position:0%
adaptive to uh and open to those kinds
 
00:36:08.839 --> 00:36:11.309 align:start position:0%
adaptive to uh and open to those kinds
of

00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities R Woodcock thank you Mr
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
chairman good morning I just to follow
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
up to your uh dialogue about the state
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire the doe uh funding you
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
for this for a million and a half
 
00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
dollars um is there a reason why they
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
they aren't funding it this year they
 
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
haven't put in their
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
budget it was a federal program that's
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
run through um through UNH and you're
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
only allowed to have it have one Grant
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
and so that's why they couldn't couldn't
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
fund it continue to fund it they had
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
told us that if we ran out of money we
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
had so many kids that we ran out of the
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
1.5 that they would find away to fund it
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately when we were running
 
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
out of money budgets were getting tight
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
and we could not get arper money and so
 
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been been it had was not
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
contined to be funded they didn't have
 
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
their own money to do it and they
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
weren't Federal programs that that point
 
00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
that we were eligible for there is a
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
federal program though that I think
 
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.390 align:start position:0%
federal program though that I think
water

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
for we have received a an eir Grant uh
 
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education for
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
summer learning path for the next three
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
years which will benefit the state of
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh so we will be serving
 
00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
children uh for a summer learning for uh
 
00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:32.599 align:start position:0%
children entering kindergarten uh so
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
prek and kindergarteners going into
 
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
first grade for the next three Summers
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh so in the our summer learning path is
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
intended to help support children in
 
00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:44.839 align:start position:0%
what we would consider the summer slide
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
so it supports children in that summer
 
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
Gap uh to prevent summer slide it's the
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
same software but because our software
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
serves children from prek all the way up
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you for your
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
testimony uh forgive me if I missed

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
Waterford been in in in
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
place Waterford has been uh around for
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
40 years okay thank

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.750 align:start position:0%
very much both for being here this
morning

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman friends and
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the house education and
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
policy Administration committee uh for
 
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
the record my name is representative
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
Jonah Orion wheeler I represent the
 
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
towns of Peter bro and Sharon I believe
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
that Miss Rosenberg and the man to her
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
right did a good job explaining why this
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is important I believe
 
00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson did the same I'm
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
here simply to say I support the
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
kindergarten Readiness program and you
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
can't start life without knowing how to
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
read and when you don't know how to read
 
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
it puts you 10 steps behind those who do
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
be onethird the man I am today without
 
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
the books that I read and
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
the liter literacy skills that I had as
 
00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
a as a young child so I would hope that
 
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire moves forward
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
in whatever way it can to make sure that
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
our children are reading and standing
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
strong and educating themselves at that

Jen kind handed out a fiscal note that

she received about 20 minutes ago for
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
the prior Bill 671 so I think everyone
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
should have a copy of
 
00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%

much good morning thank you Mr chairman

and thank you committee members my name
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
is representative Melissa Lichfield and
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
I represent the towns of Brentwood
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
Danville and Fremont New
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I come before you today with
 
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh one of three cell phone bills that
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
have been put out there this particular
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
session what makes my cell phone bill
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I wanted to
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
start by sharing with you is just simply
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
systemic problems require systemic
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
Solutions a study by Professor Michael
 
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
pner at the University of Oregon found
 
00:48:43.549 --> 00:48:43.559 align:start position:0%
that if you are focusing on something
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
and get interrupted on average it will
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
take you 23
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
minutes for you to get back to the same
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
state of
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
focus and my thought is if you've got a
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
kid on a class that's 50 minutes long
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
and their cell phone is
 
00:49:02.589 --> 00:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
pinging one ping two pings your entire
 
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
period also the writer Don bald James
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
Baldwin had said not everything that is
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
faced can be changed but nothing can be
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
changed until it is faced this crisis is
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
human-made and it can be unmade by us
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
too um the Pew Research Center which is
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
bipartisan has stated that most most
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
Americans back cell phone bands during
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
class but few are all day restrictions
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
68% of us adults say that they support a
 
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
ban on middle and high school students
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
using cell phones during class the
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
Washington Times October 3rd 24 um they
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
they are stating that cell phone banss
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
for public schools um for public school
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
students do divide parents and I wanted
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
to address that a little bit early on um
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
I know one of the biggest concerns that
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
the parents have is Safety and Security
 
00:50:02.589 --> 00:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
and within this bill and all of the
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
bills that have come forward there are
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
exceptions if you're on IEP certain 504s
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
and certainly if there is a medical
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
issue that being said I had served for
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
many years on the sau6 Safety and
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
Security committee on that committee we
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
actually were the first to win an award
 
00:50:22.829 --> 00:50:22.839 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire for our
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
progress with Safety and Security we
 
00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
started just after the Sandy Hook track
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
try one of the things that we learned
 
00:50:32.349 --> 00:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
about was there's a hierarchy with the
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
cell phone towers so if there is some
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
type of an emergency the First
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
Responders actually have access to that
 
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
first and these kiddos are going to fall
 
00:50:45.549 --> 00:50:45.559 align:start position:0%
down at the bottom of the totem pole um
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
I also want to throw out to you some
 
00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals that have happened which
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
we joke but it's true the kiddo's
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
frontal loes have not completely
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
developed as yet there have been times
 
00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
where kiddos have thought it was funny
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
just harmless to text a parent saying oh
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
Mom oh Dad I got shot in the like it's
 
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
not funny and we can't have that sort of
 
00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:10.109 align:start position:0%
not funny and we can't have that sort of
thing

00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
happening the other thing that came up
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
too is you hear this a lot quite often
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
that the parents are with good
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
intentions I've done it myself but what
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
do you want for dinner tonight right it
 
00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:22.799 align:start position:0%
can wait it can wait um Florida last
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
year became the first state to enact a
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
ban on cell phones during class time as
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
Governor Ron decided to sign this into
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
law he said social media does more harm
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
than good more than a dozen states from
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
Alabama to Connecticut have followed
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
suit amid bipartisan consensus that

phones more for cyberbullying
 
00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
pornography and video games than for

parents um among those who support a
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
band 70% say a major reason students
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
would develop social skills 50% say a
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
major reason reason it students would be
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
less likely to
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
cheat 39% say a major reason is it would
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
so 72% of United States High School
 
00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
teachers say cell phone distraction is a
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
major problem in the classroom High
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
School teachers are saying that cell
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
phone policies are hard to
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
enforce Governor um the governor of New
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
York has a plan to ban only smartphones
 
00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
which I thought that was interesting by
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
the way um basically you could still use
 
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
your flip phones and your your slide
 
00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
phones um the cell phone statistics
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
though I wanted to share this is 20
 
00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
consumer Fair cure key insights almost
 
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
all Americans
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
98% own a mobile phone this translates
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
to almost 331 million people more than 9
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
out of 10 91% of Americans own a
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
smartphone each day Americans spend 4
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
hours and 30 minutes on their mobile
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
phones and check their phone 144 times
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
per day so like I I tried to like do a
 
00:53:57.309 --> 00:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
little bit of math like it AI had said
 
00:54:00.789 --> 00:54:00.799 align:start position:0%
the average American gets about 5 uh 5.7
 
00:54:02.829 --> 00:54:02.839 align:start position:0%
hours of sleep per night so I round it
 
00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:05.319 align:start position:0%
up to 6 hours and you know doing the
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
math from there um it seems to
 
00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:11.720 align:start position:0%
me that we are checking our telephones
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
on average every 7 and 1 half minutes
 
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
during the waking
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
hours nearly 57% of Americans consider
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
themselves mobile phone addicts children
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
on children on average get their F first
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%

00:54:31.789 --> 00:54:31.799 align:start position:0%
that's below the minimum age for social
 
00:54:31.799 --> 00:54:32.950 align:start position:0%
that's below the minimum age for social

00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%

00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%

world's internet traffic comes from
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
mobile phones in 2023 the US Surgeon
 
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
General released a social media media
 
00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:47.799 align:start position:0%
advisory nearly 70% of parents say
 
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
parenting is now more difficult than it
 
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
was 20 years ago with technology and
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
social media as the top two-sided
 
00:54:57.309 --> 00:54:57.319 align:start position:0%
reasons um they threw out their
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
suggestions for policy makers and that
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
was you know just basically what can we
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
do what can we do out there um as
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in our communities
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
suggestions for policy makers pursue
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
policies that further limit access in
 
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
ways that minimize the risk of harm to
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
social media for all children um and
 
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
then for parents parents to create
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
tech-free zones
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
um another Pro problematic issue is
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
social media use has been linked to ADHD
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
um also social media fear of missing out
 
00:55:31.789 --> 00:55:31.799 align:start position:0%
or the pervasive apprehension that
 
00:55:33.309 --> 00:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
others might be having rewarding

this is
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
12522 um they stated that nearly half of
 
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
us teens have been bullied or harassed
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%

at least one have experienced at least
 
00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
one type of cyber bullying
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
listed uh within that Encompass within
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
that 32% have experienced offensive name
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%

or who they are with by someone other
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
than a parent
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
consent so I had come up with
 
00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
$250,000 for a grant which I realize I
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
probably don't have the best timing um
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
right during a budget year I know things
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
are tight so I'll just tell you that
 
00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
going into it I I was at um an education
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
conference this past fall and to be
 
00:56:59.710 --> 00:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
perfectly honest with all of you I
 
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily see the cell phone
 
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
use in the schools as a problem until
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
that conference simply because as many
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
of you know you've heard me say before I
 
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
have four kiddos and they've been to
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
both public and private schools my kids
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
aren't allowed to use their cell phone
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
so at the middle school level it was
 
00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
just no cell phone use whatsoever
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
whether it was don't bring it or keep it
 
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
in your backpack uh at the high school
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
level I know right now my daughter is
 
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
experiencing they just have shoe racks
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know the pouches when you come in
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
the classroom you put it in the pouch
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
and you take it out as you leave um they
 
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
do allow children to have it for the
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
last 20 minutes of study hall you know
 
00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
during lunch um in between
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
periods but my point is that when I sat
 
00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
there and I listened to this and they
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
talked about um how addictive the cell
 
00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:49.240 align:start position:0%
phone is I have to be honest with you I
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
had to sit back and I had to think you
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
know as an adult um I think I'm addicted
 
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
to my cell phone my son for example he
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
was at the Super Bowl this weekend and I
 
00:58:01.029 --> 00:58:01.039 align:start position:0%
didn't hear from him after the Super
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
Bowl and 3:00 a.m. here I am checking my
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
phone why didn't they text me they made
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
it back to the hotel safe you know so I
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
I do I completely understand where
 
00:58:11.789 --> 00:58:11.799 align:start position:0%
parents are coming from so my thought
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
was that I went ahead and I researched
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
you know um the school districts that
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
are out there um the average public high
 
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
school in New Hampshire is 536 students
 
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
um I went down the list of listing you
 
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
know each of the largest schools and I
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
thought okay there is a program and it
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be the specific program
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
it just happened to coincidentally be a
 
00:58:35.789 --> 00:58:35.799 align:start position:0%
vendor that was at the conference and it
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
was Yonder which is what we heard about
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
from some people that testified here
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
before the nice thing about a program
 
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:45.559 align:start position:0%
like that is that $ thousand mini
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
computer that parents spend so much
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
money on is with the child at all times
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the day right they put it in
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
the pouch it magnetically closes there
 
00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
are magnets let's say this is the exit
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
of the school where the kids just swipe
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
and within 3 seconds they have access to
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
their phone again I also personally
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
think it's a little bit more San I
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate the shoe racks I think it's a
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
great idea but I do think the pouch is
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
probably more sanitary to be perfectly
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
honest with you it's your own pouch so I
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
figured 250,000 at roughly um $30 each
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
that covers about
 
00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
8,333 pouches I know that's woefully low
 
00:59:27.789 --> 00:59:27.799 align:start position:0%
compared to the 60,000 students that we
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
have here I just in my thoughts I did
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
not necessarily see a top- down order
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
working with something like this because
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
we are so used to having our cell phones
 
00:59:39.789 --> 00:59:39.799 align:start position:0%
on us at this point in time and I
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
honestly thought that if we were to get
 
00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:43.640 align:start position:0%
a pilot program working out there with
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
schools that are interested I have no
 
00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:47.799 align:start position:0%
doubt that they're going to show high
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
success rates they're going to show kids
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
that are happier we've heard that um
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll have uh higher scores
 
00:59:56.349 --> 00:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
out there for these kiddos and my
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
thought was that would help us to
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
organically gain more momentum and
 
01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:01.480 align:start position:0%
people would say hey wow this is really
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
working for that district and this
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
District let's hop on board I also
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
didn't want to put out there an unfunded
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
Mandate of any type so I figured that
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
this was the best way to compromise I do
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
want to address too that I had put
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
myself on this bill I did not put any
 
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
other co-sponsors it was just simply I
 
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
have served this is my second
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
non-consecutive term so I per L did not
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
get legislation ready before I was
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
elected you know superstitious um so we
 
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
had a very quick window to get that
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
legislation in as soon as we're elected
 
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
um I did that and it was just more
 
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
important to me that I get it right with
 
01:00:40.589 --> 01:00:40.599 align:start position:0%
OS and things were a little chaotic this
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
year versus going out there for the
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors um so that's it thank you so
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
much for listening I appreciate it thank
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
you very much represent Murray thank you
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thanks for taking my question I
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
think we've heard a number of bills on
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
different iteration
 
01:00:59.230 --> 01:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
of this I just wanted to be clear when
 
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh we're looking at this your bill
 
01:01:03.309 --> 01:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
actually requires a policy be adopted
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to stand up a pilot
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
program is that
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
okay represent Terry yes uh thank you uh
 
01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for uh the the Myriad
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh of data that you have provided uh to
 
01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
us today in support of the need for
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
action in this
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
area um my question is with respect to
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
the um the states that you have cited
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
who have already
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
acted um are there any states of which
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
you are
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
aware the policy or the requirements of
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
the statute have uh already been
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
implemented for a time and there is some
 
01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
initial uh data indicating um how well
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
the programs are working the
 
01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions yes and I can get that to
 
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
you in written form but yes there is
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
data and I'm and I'm drawing a blank
 
01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
it's down south I don't know if it's
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
Mississippi or Louisiana I want to get
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
you the correct facts but um yes they've
 
01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
actually they've actually seen a
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
difference a huge difference in their
 
01:02:22.829 --> 01:02:22.839 align:start position:0%
test scores as well thanks repr s thank
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
you I just wanted to um ask the point of
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
clar ification and it's possible that
 
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative dry will actually have
 
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
more information than you might just in
 
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
terms of the way um just because I know
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
based on my husband's job he's at sort
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
of the top of the hierarchy for the um
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
when when sell service is uh restricted
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
to people um because of his nature of
 
01:02:45.549 --> 01:02:45.559 align:start position:0%
being in charge of the First Responders
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
you know he has to have full access
 
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
right but my understanding and from
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
being at events where access is
 
01:02:54.269 --> 01:02:54.279 align:start position:0%
restricted it's that calls are
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
restricted for sure and it's though
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
First Responders that have that direct
 
01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
immediate access to calls but people are
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
generally able to get um text messaging
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
basic text messaging not images sent out
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of safety or
 
01:03:10.269 --> 01:03:10.279 align:start position:0%
notification I'm I'm just wondering if
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
you looked at that I think about those
 
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
pouches that you're talking about that
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
lock as students come in and out of
 
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
school and in the incidences which you
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
know hopefully we won't have one
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
although I'm sure we will in New
 
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at some point um but if
 
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
students have to get to an exterior door
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
in order to unlock a phone in order to
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
contact 911 I'm just concerned about how
 
01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
whereas if they're in the shoe rck on
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
the door it's I'm just trying to
 
01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:37.720 align:start position:0%
understand how
 
01:03:40.589 --> 01:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
to I I think that that's just one
 
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
particular system that yeah um and
 
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
right right um I will mention that we
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
will have a a subcommittee looking at uh
 
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
this as well as the other bills so um
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully that subcommittee
 
01:03:59.710 --> 01:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh can delve into some of those
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
issues do you have a brief
 
01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
response well you stole my
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
thunder I'm just kidding okay now so
 
01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
right I understand I understand what
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying and first of all I don't
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
know the answer to you're right I it
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
would I also got the impression that it
 
01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
would slow down the time in between um
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
receiving and sending messages but I
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
would have to verify because when I did
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
this work honestly it was a couple years
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
back so things have probably evolved
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
since then I would assume that we would
 
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
have the teacher would have a phone
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
number one of cell phone on them number
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
two um I would assume that there would
 
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
also be a land line that was
 
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
involved thank you very much you see no
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you very much
 
01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Mr chair members of the
 
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Becky Wilson
 
01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire school boards
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
Association uh we are not taking a
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
specific position on this exact Bill we
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
do certainly support the intention of
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
the bill we understand the desire for a
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
cell phone policy at the local
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard level uh we certainly
 
01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
support the idea of creating classroom
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
environments that are less distracted
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
all around um many of the points have
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
already been made I think by members of
 
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
this committee and by the sponsor of
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
this bill but we would just ask the
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
committee to consider a few points uh we
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
know you've heard significant testimony
 
01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
about cell phones in schools uh based on
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
other bills as well we want to reiterate
 
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
that there are probably four or five
 
01:05:44.109 --> 01:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
bills around cell phone policies in
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
schools just this session uh we some of
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
them have conflicting language or
 
01:05:50.589 --> 01:05:50.599 align:start position:0%
different language then this particular
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
Bill we would really ask the committee
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
again it sounds like there will be a
 
01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to do some work sessions on
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
this but that there's some collaboration
 
01:05:59.230 --> 01:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
so that whatever language is coming out
 
01:06:02.029 --> 01:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
of this committee um doesn't conflict
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
with other things that are also coming
 
01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:05.079 align:start position:0%
out of this committee or other
 
01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
committees um we also would just ask
 
01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
again that uh the legislation allow
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
local school boards and District
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
administration to collaboratively
 
01:06:16.109 --> 01:06:16.119 align:start position:0%
develop whatever policy is coming out of
 
01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:17.799 align:start position:0%
this legislation based on their own
 
01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
local needs their school culture
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
Staffing the fiscal impact that that's
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
that whatever uh language is coming out
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
in a combined bill is not too
 
01:06:29.269 --> 01:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
prescriptive we certainly understand the
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
desire to have certain aspects of a
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
policy covered or certain content that
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
would be covered in the policy but in
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
terms of exactly what is managed in the
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
policy or who is managing it or what is
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
allowed or not allowed that that be left
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
to uh local decision- making based on a
 
01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:47.079 align:start position:0%
number of factors which I think you've
 
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
talked about in many of the hearings
 
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
regarding the cell phone use um I'm
 
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
very much r kuger thank you Mr chairman
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I was
 
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
wondering about uh the issue with the
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
Apple watch or any watch you know
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
they're becoming more sophisticated I'm
 
01:07:08.109 --> 01:07:08.119 align:start position:0%
probably one of the last people on the
 
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
planet to get a watch but it can do a
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
lot um texting being one of those things
 
01:07:16.109 --> 01:07:16.119 align:start position:0%
have any of the policies addressed that
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
usage do you know of thank you for the
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
question representative I can't speak
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
specifically to individual District cell
 
01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:23.799 align:start position:0%
phone policies that are already in place
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
it's not currently a required by law law
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
policy so we don't necessarily house
 
01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
samples of all of those policies that
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
are out there um I will speak from a
 
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
district administrator standpoint that
 
01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
technology is changing all the time uh
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
again I think that's partially why it
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
would be helpful if the polic whatever
 
01:07:44.829 --> 01:07:44.839 align:start position:0%
comes out of this legislation is not
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
very prescriptive because it will be
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
difficult if it is too prescriptive to
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
be able to adjust policies to to
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
adapting technology um I we have a as I
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
think you heard Mr Christina say
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
previously a fairly outdated um
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
electronic communications Pol sample
 
01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
policy but again that does it's not
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
specific to cell phones in fact it came
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
out of a time when I think students were
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
carrying pagers and things like that so
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
I mean there a quite dated I'll just say
 
01:08:15.069 --> 01:08:15.079 align:start position:0%
that uh but again to address the fact
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
that technology is constantly changing
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
what students will have access to is
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
constantly changing the fiscal impact of
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
managing that in a different way in
 
01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
different districts could could change
 
01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:27.640 align:start position:0%
so while we certainly understand certain
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
aspects needing to be included in a
 
01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
policy allowing the Local District to
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
sort of craft that policy to meet
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
whatever they are seeing at a given time
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
I think would be really beneficial thank
 
01:08:38.759 --> 01:08:39.669 align:start position:0%
I think would be really beneficial thank
thank

01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
you represent Terry thank you uh I just
 
01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:44.759 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that I I'm I'm clear
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
with something that you said because it
 
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
goes through the question that I want to
 
01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
ask and that is you are not currently
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
aware of um how many school districts
 
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
have policies what the content may be um
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
is that correct thank you for the
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
question and if if regardless because
 
01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:07.719 align:start position:0%
there is going to be a subcommittee
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
would you be in a position to be able to
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
furnish us with some sample policies
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
that you solicit if you do not from
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
school boards that you do not currently
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
may not currently be in your possession
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you for the question
 
01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
representative uh we certainly will work
 
01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
with the committee or the subcommittee
 
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
to try to give you whatever information
 
01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
we can from local districts the majority
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
of local school districts have their
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
policies and school boards posted online
 
01:09:34.110 --> 01:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
the majority of them so if if there is a
 
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
district or a school board that has a
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
local cell phone specific policy my
 
01:09:40.349 --> 01:09:40.359 align:start position:0%
guess is it's likely posted online uh on
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
their website or available that way we
 
01:09:45.309 --> 01:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
can try to collate some of that um we do
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
not necessarily gather policies on any
 
01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
particular thing from any school boards
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know housing that at the
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
school boards Association but certainly
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to to help the department
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
help the committee get whatever
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
information would be useful I think you
 
01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
had a superintendent here previously
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
from pelum um who said that they had
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
recently instituted that so I think you
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
know we could at least do a little bit
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
of digging to try to help support that
 
01:10:13.229 --> 01:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
work thank you very much thank you very
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony and the uh final
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%

particular um cell phone bill we do
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate the chair's willingness to
 
01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
pull together of subcommittee uh to look
 
01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
at the various bills and to talk about
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh the various impacts we appreciate the
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
representativ concern about smart
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
watches and where they might uh play
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
into this uh communication piece we
 
01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate the representatives
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh extensive research on the impact of
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
cell phones in schools and we also
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that there's a fiscal note
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
attached to your particular piece of
 
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
legislation so thank you for that um
 
01:11:26.669 --> 01:11:26.679 align:start position:0%
their competing philosophies um around
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
the use of cell phones we certainly
 
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
agree that something needs to be decided
 
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
upon in the end it's our job to make
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
sure that it gets done whether it's a
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
local policy a state law or however it
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
may come about um whatever the decision
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
may be it's our job to make sure that
 
01:11:44.669 --> 01:11:44.679 align:start position:0%
that happens um representative Terry
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to uh try to enlist from
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
some of our members the existing
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
policies and also the procedures of how
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
those uh policies were developed so we
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question as well as well
 
01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.360 align:start position:0%

um so what this piece of paper
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
shows um and these are all this is all
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
data from the Department of education
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
but it's um it's uh displayed by this
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
really fantastic website put on by
 
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
Georgetown University in Washington DC
 
01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:36.430 align:start position:0%
Georgetown University in Washington DC
called

01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
called
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
edunom so that website is a great one if
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
you want to sort of
 
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
visualize um any kind of education
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
related data and it gets down to the the
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
school in New Hampshire for example you
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
can compare all the schools and look at
 
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
various kinds of data but anyways this
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
is kind of a summary page
 
01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
and it shows three things first of all
 
01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
it shows that that there's a serious
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
problem if you look at the bottom of the
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
page you can see uh that over this
 
01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
10-year period starting in
 
01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
2013 um math and reading scores on on
 
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
standardized tests have been in a
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
serious decline okay and um the second
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
thing it shows if you look at the top of
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
the page is that money is not the
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
problem right spending um per pupil is
 
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
up at an all-time high um way above
 
01:19:37.629 --> 01:19:37.639 align:start position:0%
inflation and so the the the the
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
solution to the problem is not spending
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
or spending isn't affecting it in a
 
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
positive way and then the third thing
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
that this shows sort of indirectly is
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
that it's not just Co right because
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
there's some covid years on this page
 
01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
but but the trend started prior to co so
 
01:20:01.709 --> 01:20:01.719 align:start position:0%
what this says to me is that um what we
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
need is different methods right
 
01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
different structures in education
 
01:20:11.709 --> 01:20:11.719 align:start position:0%
because what we have now is not working
 
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
and and more money isn't solving the
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
problem so this particular bill um is
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
kind of a very is a very small part of
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
that but what it does is um it
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
consolidates the number of saus we have
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
in the state so so the number of saus we
 
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
have right now I think is
 
01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
104 and it includes two that are cross
 
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
state uh boundaries there's two school
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
districts one that's a New Hampshire
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
Vermont school district one that's a a
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Maine school district and
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
and those school districts are also
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
single district saus and and this bill
 
01:20:55.629 --> 01:20:55.639 align:start position:0%
does not touch those so the bill is only
 
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
about all of the purely New Hampshire
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
saus and so I think there's 102 of those
 
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
this bill would reduce it to
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
12 okay and the way it reduces them is
 
01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
to give one for Manchester and one for
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
nashaa so essentially no change there
 
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
because I think those are you know
 
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
cities are single district saus and um
 
01:21:27.149 --> 01:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
and then the other uh the other 10 would
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
be the remaining part one for the
 
01:21:31.229 --> 01:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
remaining parts of Hillsboro County and
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
nine for one for each of the of the
 
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
other counties so it's it's a uh
 
01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.189 align:start position:0%
other counties so it's it's a uh
county-based

01:21:38.189 --> 01:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
county-based
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
organization and the the goal of that is
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh basically partly its efficiency
 
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
because I tend to think um with fewer uh
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
with more centralization with with um
 
01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
fewer superintenden and so on there
 
01:21:58.750 --> 01:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
should be some economies of scale right
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
we can have bigger Transportation
 
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
contracts if every SAU had a grant
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
writer maybe when you put 10 of them
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
together you don't need 10 grant writers
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
maybe you can get by with five or
 
01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
something like that same thing with HR
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
and payroll and all the other features
 
01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
and negotiations with unions and and all
 
01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
the other features of an
 
01:22:25.629 --> 01:22:25.639 align:start position:0%
SAU um so so part of the goal here is
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
simply efficiency because and but the
 
01:22:31.229 --> 01:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
second part is
 
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
also um trying to attack the the
 
01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
structure a bit because right now um the
 
01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
person that that um is most important is
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
most in control of the school system is
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
the school
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent um if you look on page
 
01:22:57.310 --> 01:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
P yes so on page
 
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
compliance um etc etc But it
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
includes a lot of direct teaching
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
related um things so they do they do
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
essentially all hiring um and they also
 
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
do you don't see it on this list because
 
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't write this as a cross out
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
but but what's also on this list what's
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the current law that's that's been
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
removed here is
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
curriculum and policy and and things
 
01:23:59.870 --> 01:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
like that so so this bill devolves
 
01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
curriculum and policy and deciding what
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
to teach and how to teach to school
 
01:24:11.229 --> 01:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
boards right so this I think increases
 
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
local control um in a good way in the
 
01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
sense that um the school board is the
 
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
closest and the to the actual situation
 
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
in their particular schools right and so
 
01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
and and the superintendent in some sense
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
is the is the uh least accountable right
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
at least a School Board gets elected and
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
so if you're not happy with what's being
 
01:24:42.109 --> 01:24:42.119 align:start position:0%
taught in your school and not being uh
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
you can change your school board but
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
changing your superintendent is sort of
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
one step removed because it's all the
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
school boards in the SAU who determine
 
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
who the superintendent is right so um so
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
the other thing that this bill does
 
01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:00.639 align:start position:0%
along these lines of having more local
 
01:25:04.109 --> 01:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
control is it makes the superintendent
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
an elected official not appointed and so
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
the superintendent would be elected by
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
um by their you know in the case of the
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
county superintendent by the the voters
 
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
in that county um in Hillsboro it would
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
be three different election districts
 
01:25:25.229 --> 01:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
one for Manchester one for for nsha and
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
one for the rest of the county but but
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
at least they would be
 
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
elected and and so I think both of those
 
01:25:36.189 --> 01:25:36.199 align:start position:0%
changes giving more responsibility to
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
school boards especially over
 
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
instruction related things like
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
curriculum um would would improve um
 
01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
teaching and also um the elect getting
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
more more um accountability on
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
superintendence I think that would
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
improve also and I think the the
 
01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
consolidation um would would help with
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
costs of this level of administration
 
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
because if you look in detail on what
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
we've been spending on education over
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
you know the last few
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
decades the costs have all been in the
 
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
non-teaching area it's not teachers that
 
01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
are somehow taking a bigger slice of the
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
pie uh of of the dollar it's the non
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
teachers that's where all of this ex
 
01:26:31.109 --> 01:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
expense this extra expense has been so
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm hoping that that this bill would
 
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
would get some more efficiency in that
 
01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:40.280 align:start position:0%
area now I do want to say that when I
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
structured this bill um there's kind of
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
an easy way to do what what I want to do
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
here and a hard way and I went with the
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
hard way so um if you simply wanted to
 
01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
have few
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
saus there's an easy way of doing it
 
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
which is you can go to the map of all
 
01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.310 align:start position:0%
which is you can go to the map of all
the

01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
saus and and just start grouping them
 
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
right you could say okay take SAU 11 12
 
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
13 and 17 put those into a single SAU
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
and then over there you got SAU 20 and
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
five and 38 and put those in a single
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
seu like that right and so um that would
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
solve a number of problem s
 
01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
because um some school districts
 
01:27:32.830 --> 01:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
cross uh county lines right so so there
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
is issue the the bill considers what to
 
01:27:37.709 --> 01:27:37.719 align:start position:0%
do with that and has a procedure and so
 
01:27:40.350 --> 01:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
on but so
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
so that would make it easier because no
 
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
school distri all all school districts
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
would just be within an SAU it just
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
would be a bigger SAU um and and there
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be any problems of SP splitting
 
01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
up monies right so so U because the
 
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
monies that go for that SAU would come
 
01:28:04.669 --> 01:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
from a specific set of existing school
 
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
districts the bill doesn't change any
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
school districts in any way
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
um but I decided against that method
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
because it didn't accomplish necessarily
 
01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:22.280 align:start position:0%
my secondary goal of making the SAU
 
01:28:24.990 --> 01:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
itself more accountable
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
right because I wanted it I I chose to
 
01:28:31.109 --> 01:28:31.119 align:start position:0%
put it as a part of a county or in the
 
01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
case of Manchester and nashwa a city so
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
that its budget would be um considered
 
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
as part of the county and and so the
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
delegation would vote on the budget and
 
01:28:47.629 --> 01:28:47.639 align:start position:0%
there would be a little bit more
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
oversight as to what's going on in the
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
SAU the SAU and the superintendent would
 
01:28:57.870 --> 01:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
have some some
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
um more people to help them but also
 
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
some more
 
01:29:08.030 --> 01:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
um some more uh control over them right
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
so that so that the county organization
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
which already has Personnel it already
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
has HR and payroll and all those kind of
 
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
things could help with the transition
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
there would be people there like County
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and so on that would help
 
01:29:27.149 --> 01:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
with the transition from what we have
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
now to this new structure but it would
 
01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
also provide some management expertise
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
and and control and so I I like that
 
01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
aspect of it and so the bill like I said
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
is is a little more complicated because
 
01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
of it but personally I think it's worth
 
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
it your M mileage may vary so I'm happy
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
to answer questions thank you any
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative selig
 
01:29:56.189 --> 01:29:56.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question so is it your
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
contention that um School
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
superintendents don't need to have any
 
01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:07.400 align:start position:0%
qualifications as related to education
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
as related to um experience as an
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
administrator or anything else because
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
as an elected person there's nothing
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
listed in here other than being
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
essentially an eligible voter in that
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
District which means that my 18-year-old
 
01:30:23.950 --> 01:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
could become the new superintendent with
 
01:30:25.709 --> 01:30:25.719 align:start position:0%
without having any understanding of any
 
01:30:28.109 --> 01:30:28.119 align:start position:0%
of the aspects of any of these skills
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question and in
 
01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
general it that's true but you know you
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
you I doubt your um the voters would
 
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
pick your 18-year-old daughter
 
01:30:49.229 --> 01:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
over you know a a more qualified person
 
01:30:52.109 --> 01:30:52.119 align:start position:0%
so um we don't have any particular
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications for our governor
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
for our other elected officials right I
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
don't even I don't even know if County
 
01:31:03.109 --> 01:31:03.119 align:start position:0%
attorneys are required to be members of
 
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
the bar or not um I'm not sure but but
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
the point is uh no I I think I'm willing
 
01:31:14.189 --> 01:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
to trust the voters to pick someone who
 
01:31:19.149 --> 01:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
is qualified and and again I see this
 
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
role by moving the the um curriculum and
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
those aspects of teaching down to the
 
01:31:29.950 --> 01:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
school board and principal level um to
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
be there'll be less of the teaching
 
01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
specific aspects of the superintendent's
 
01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
job and more of the administrative
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
aspects followup thank you so for
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
followup um I I think about the way that
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
our brand new superintendent in my
 
01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
district has come in and spent time
 
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
getting to know children in the district
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
teachers in the district um the
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
different challenges that are very
 
01:31:58.030 --> 01:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
specific to our small District to
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
identify what's going to be in the best
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
needs of our students and I I came from
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
teaching in a district that was County
 
01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
based where there was a lot of very
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
remote supervision how do you see the
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
superintendent having sufficient time to
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
actually know what all of the different
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
needs are of the very very um schools in
 
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
our counties given that there's been no
 
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
structure or way to transition to that
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
type of a model
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
yes thanks for the question but again
 
01:32:29.229 --> 01:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just going to go back
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
to I think those local um
 
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
aspects should be local and should be
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the school board
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
right now the school
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
board I I've never seen my my local
 
01:32:49.109 --> 01:32:49.119 align:start position:0%
school principal without the
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
superintendent sitting next to him you
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
know the superintendent
 
01:33:00.189 --> 01:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
has um has too much of a role in my mind
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
and and the local people who know what's
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
going on the school board and their
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
principles and and other Administration
 
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
that they hire um they are intimately
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
involved with the children with the
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
teachers and so on and so um I'd like to
 
01:33:23.550 --> 01:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
see more local control and and have the
 
01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:24.270 align:start position:0%
see more local control and and have the
um

01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
administrator the counties um in some
 
01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
way do you share any concern that
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
there's potentially some you know that
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
you've you've done the sort of District
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
apportionment uh without voter input or
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
a conversation around that I for
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
potential disen fragement
 
01:33:53.310 --> 01:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
issues yeah thanks for the question um
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
sort of yes and no I mean we have the
 
01:33:59.790 --> 01:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
most representative legislature in the
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
country the reason there is 400 of us is
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
um to
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
give um everyone a say in in the Affairs
 
01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
of the state um but we do not
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
allow we determine a lot of things
 
01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
centrally in the
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
legislature um because we don't want
 
01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
um scattered laws right we we don't want
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
um this law here and that law there and
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
so on so so I I guess I'm not too
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
worried about it because um I think that
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
so our legislature is twice as big as
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
the second biggest one it's which is
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania much bigger state so we
 
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
have representation from every corner of
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
the state that will be voting on this
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
and votes on all of our other
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
legislation so I guess it that part
 
01:35:04.189 --> 01:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't bother me too much and and
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
also again moving the SAU to being more
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
administrative and more um bureaucratic
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
if you want I don't know maybe more um
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
technical that kind of thing and and
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
less involved in actual teaching I think
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
that would be something locals would
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate right because because they
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
themselves would then have more control
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
schools thank you um so Additionally you
 
01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned the conversation around County
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
oversight and County Commissioners um as
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
someone who chairs one of the county
 
01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
delegations um I'm curious to understand
 
01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
how you would stand up some something
 
01:35:57.790 --> 01:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
like this um and without there being a
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
department stood up within there as
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
well line of Appropriations don't just
 
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
happen without there being a department
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
to associate them with in the
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation control report so I have
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
some serious questions about if you
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
could answer how that would work right
 
01:36:17.629 --> 01:36:17.639 align:start position:0%
thank you yes I do see the
 
01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
superintendent's office as being a
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
county or city in the case of Manchester
 
01:36:24.719 --> 01:36:25.590 align:start position:0%
county or city in the case of Manchester
and

01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
Nashua um level
 
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
department um if you think that I
 
01:36:35.229 --> 01:36:35.239 align:start position:0%
haven't uh written the law you know as
 
01:36:35.239 --> 01:36:36.750 align:start position:0%
haven't uh written the law you know as
as

01:36:36.750 --> 01:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.590 align:start position:0%
as
um

01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:42.270 --> 01:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
uh completely as it should be I'm I'm
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
happy to entertain the changes um but
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
yes I I think of it as another County
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
official probably more important than
 
01:36:56.430 --> 01:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
but similar to the county attorney the
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
sheriff the you know all those kind of
 
01:37:03.149 --> 01:37:03.159 align:start position:0%
officials representative Terry thank you
 
01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
um while um
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
recognizing uh the demographic uh
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
differences um across the
 
01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
states um and in looking at um New
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh the data that you provided
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
us um and and kind of moving somewhat
 
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
between the granular level and the
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
40,000 ft level because clearly this is
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
a uh proposed piece of legislation that
 
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
will um create an earthquake and
 
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
tectonic shifts um uh if if in fact it
 
01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
were to be implemented in any way shape
 
01:37:44.669 --> 01:37:44.679 align:start position:0%
or form slightly interrupt uh yeah the
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
the the state of the room
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't seem to agree with well
 
01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
maybe it may yeah um so
 
01:37:59.950 --> 01:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
so being aware that there are states
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
that uh administer education on a county
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
level for example uh Virginia with which
 
01:38:08.830 --> 01:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
I'm somewhat
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
familiar um would you be able do you
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
know or would you be able to provide us
 
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
with um with data that would show us the
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
differences with respect to spending
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
inflation reading and math scores in
 
01:38:29.229 --> 01:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
states that administer
 
01:38:33.149 --> 01:38:33.159 align:start position:0%
education um on a on a county level
 
01:38:37.070 --> 01:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
rather than on a shall we call it a
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
local level where we have so many we
 
01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
have our districts could be
 
01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
characterized in one way shape or form
 
01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:44.189 align:start position:0%
characterized in one way shape or form
is

01:38:44.189 --> 01:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
balkanized yeah thanks for the question
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
I could work on this um I don't have um
 
01:38:54.189 --> 01:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
specific data
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
as you're describing I mean there's all
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
different kinds of um structures in the
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
various States as I understand it the
 
01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:05.320 align:start position:0%
state of Hawaii is a one-state school
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
board right so you know the it's it's it
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
is all over the place
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
quick but in view of the fact that you
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
are proposing a county
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
model it would be very helpful to be
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
able to look at state that administer uh
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
that are structured on the basis of
 
01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
counties and so I'd really appreciate it
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
if you could do anything because I'm a
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
little short of staff to be thank you
 
01:39:36.589 --> 01:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'm heading into the budget
 
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you but I'm I'm heading into the
 
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
budget season and so my personal time is
 
01:39:43.709 --> 01:39:43.719 align:start position:0%
is quite limited as well but I I'll see
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
what I can do see if I can find a paper
 
01:39:47.470 --> 01:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
or something represent
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
Corell thank you madam chair I I'm
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap my head around the part
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
of it where the super superintendent is
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
elected um so I'm from Manchester we
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
have over 12,000 students over 2,000
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
employees 24 schools um the
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
superintendent over just leaving out
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
curriculum the superintendent is busy
 
01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
going to subcommittee meetings going to
 
01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
the schools um attending events when do
 
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
you foree them raising money and camp
 
01:40:25.629 --> 01:40:25.639 align:start position:0%
campaigning without taking time away
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
from their job duties um which of course
 
01:40:32.350 --> 01:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
they don't even have to be qualified for
 
01:40:36.109 --> 01:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
for this so having to campaign every two
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
years which could mean turnover every
 
01:40:41.229 --> 01:40:41.239 align:start position:0%
two years of somebody who won't
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
know anything about what they're doing I
 
01:40:47.470 --> 01:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
how do you see that as a
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
positive yeah thank you for the question
 
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
so I just in general
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
see more control by the voters as as a
 
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
positive thing and
 
01:41:05.629 --> 01:41:05.639 align:start position:0%
um I think that we've made the
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent just too
 
01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
powerful with too little um direct
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
Direct Control by the voters
 
01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:17.430 align:start position:0%
Direct Control by the voters
um

01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
that I don't feel like you know I know
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
my County attorney quite well I don't
 
01:41:27.589 --> 01:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
feel like somehow their their job is
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
being short Changed by the fact that
 
01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:30.229 align:start position:0%
being short Changed by the fact that
they're

01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:41:30.239 --> 01:41:31.870 align:start position:0%
they're
elected

01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
elected
 
01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:33.910 align:start position:0%
elected
um

01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:38.589 --> 01:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
so no I I guess I'm I'm not in line with
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
the premise of your
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
question representa Murray thank you
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking me
 
01:41:48.030 --> 01:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
a question are aren't superintendent
 
01:41:50.750 --> 01:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
already at the most local premise
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
responsible to the duly elected boards
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
that they serve alongside of and are
 
01:41:59.350 --> 01:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
elected boards oversee
 
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
superintendence yes thank you for the
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
question so it's true that the school
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
boards um meet as sort of a a large
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
school board and they they elect or they
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
hire the
 
01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:16.030 align:start position:0%
hire the
superintendent

01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
um but that's a step removed from the
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
so whereas it's the voters themselves
 
01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
that vote on the budget and the other
 
01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
aspects of their school board but but
 
01:42:39.669 --> 01:42:39.679 align:start position:0%
they don't have a more direct say in
 
01:42:42.350 --> 01:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
what's going on at the SAU level and
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
because if you again if you look at
 
01:42:46.830 --> 01:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
these this list on page seven and eight
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
it remains that there's a large large
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
aspect of of teach teaching that's and
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
and uh running of schools that's done by
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
the superintendent so the superintendent
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
is clearly the most important person in
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
the school system most directs what's
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
going on and again I feel too a little
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
bit too remove from the
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
voters representative
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
Lichfield thank you madam chair and
 
01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
question so honestly you may very well
 
01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
have gone over this during the
 
01:43:24.669 --> 01:43:24.679 align:start position:0%
introduction I just found myself getting
 
01:43:26.589 --> 01:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
so caught in the weeds you know
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
processing all this that I might it what
 
01:43:32.669 --> 01:43:32.679 align:start position:0%
what prompted the El I understand that
 
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
you feel removed but what prompted
 
01:43:37.390 --> 01:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
electing superintendent was there an
 
01:43:39.870 --> 01:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
outcry within the state from
 
01:43:42.270 --> 01:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
constituents voters residents saying
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
we're really unhappy with the current
 
01:43:45.870 --> 01:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
status of how things are done or with
 
01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
our superintendent in
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
general yeah thank you for the question
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
no I wouldn't say it's that it's it's
 
01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
it's more that
 
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at this I think based on
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
what I gave you earlier the the the
 
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
conclusion I gave you from this data was
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
that um it's the structure of our system
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
that needs reform it it's the way we're
 
01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
going about things that needs to change
 
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
and so that led to thinking about what's
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
going on with the structure
 
01:44:28.589 --> 01:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
realizing that um the superintendent's
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
the most important person they there's
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
no there's not very clear oversight over
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
the superintendent I mean
 
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
superintendent um one thing I changed
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
was um contact with the public is on the
 
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
list currently in law of what
 
01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
superintendents do right shouldn't it be
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
the school board who's doing contact
 
01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
with the public you know so that's one
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
of the things I change you know things
 
01:45:00.669 --> 01:45:00.679 align:start position:0%
like that so so it's just more thought
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
about the structure and I I generally
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
think uh moving uh I I like local
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
control and I think that um people make
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
decisions better not every school within
 
01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
a SAU is going to be in the same
 
01:45:21.589 --> 01:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
situation right I mean some of them are
 
01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
going to be performing very well and and
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
others less well right and so so the the
 
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
way they deal with um education has got
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
to be different and got to be tailored
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
to their own circumstances so I do think
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
um we'll get better
 
01:45:43.790 --> 01:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
results if we emphasize local
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
control representative celik thank you
 
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking this question
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
and it may be that it's more suitable to
 
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
a representative from the school boards
 
01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
Association um but my understanding from
 
01:45:57.550 --> 01:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
conversations I've had with our
 
01:45:59.070 --> 01:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard members and our
 
01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent and in looking at school
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
structure in the state is that
 
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard members are restricted in
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
their abilities around micromanagement
 
01:46:11.589 --> 01:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
of classrooms and classroom models while
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
they're looking at curriculum as a whole
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
and partnering with the superintendent
 
01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
with with guidance around that that they
 
01:46:20.109 --> 01:46:20.119 align:start position:0%
are not to be going into the schools and
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
and checking these things they're not to
 
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
be interfering with classroom teachers
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of protection on a
 
01:46:27.189 --> 01:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
number of different levels in both
 
01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
directions and so I'm I'm trying to
 
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
understand if the school board suddenly
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
has full control over the
 
01:46:37.149 --> 01:46:37.159 align:start position:0%
curriculum who's how is this going to be
 
01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
able to be evaluated who's checking it
 
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
and how the legality of all of this
 
01:46:42.750 --> 01:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
could possibly work especially if we end
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
up with a partisan component to what is
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
position I guess I don't see sorry thank
 
01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
you for the question but I I guess I I
 
01:46:59.790 --> 01:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:04.199 align:start position:0%
um I think that um
 
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
certainly I mean teaching is something
 
01:47:09.149 --> 01:47:09.159 align:start position:0%
that's going on all the time right and
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
so um it the curriculum and things like
 
01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
that I first of all people can hire
 
01:47:21.589 --> 01:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
people who work on that they do but but
 
01:47:21.599 --> 01:47:23.950 align:start position:0%
people who work on that they do but but
also

01:47:23.950 --> 01:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that it needs um massive
 
01:47:31.470 --> 01:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
change year to year that kind of thing
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
right I think um people can refine it
 
01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
people teachers can be given more um
 
01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:42.719 align:start position:0%
more leeway on on what to teach and how
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
um so again I I just think that um
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
moving things more
 
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
local um has the advantage that
 
01:47:58.350 --> 01:47:58.360 align:start position:0%
that um some more more things can be
 
01:48:03.149 --> 01:48:03.159 align:start position:0%
tried locally and if they work locally
 
01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
then word will get out and others can
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
follow you know so so when you have a
 
01:48:11.589 --> 01:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
more of a
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
topown um control from the
 
01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent to the schools of this is
 
01:48:19.709 --> 01:48:19.719 align:start position:0%
the way to teach and this is what to
 
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:23.560 align:start position:0%
teach and so on um they'll be less
 
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
experimentation there'll be less and and
 
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's not even the right word but
 
01:48:30.510 --> 01:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
there'll be less
 
01:48:33.550 --> 01:48:33.560 align:start position:0%
um less fine-tuning for the for the
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
local um Effectiveness right and
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
certainly people will find out if a
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
particular school all of a sudden uh
 
01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:43.990 align:start position:0%
particular school all of a sudden uh
becomes

01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
effective um and has you know Rising
 
01:48:50.589 --> 01:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
scores and and better outcomes then
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
they'll people will want to know what
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
you doing right and and so
 
01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
um making that you know not something
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
that's done by by some number of
 
01:49:04.750 --> 01:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
superintendents but something that's
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
done more on the school level um I think
 
01:49:11.589 --> 01:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
can't help but lead to a better
 
01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
outcome any other
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
01:49:18.070 --> 01:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire for coming in and
 
01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
we'll see you this
 
01:49:22.589 --> 01:49:22.599 align:start position:0%
afternoon you certainly will so that one
 
01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
was is actually going to be in rep's
 
01:49:29.470 --> 01:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:43.870 align:start position:0%
 
FW

01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
sorry good morning Madam chair thank you
 
01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak with the
 
01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
committee this morning Jerry FW New
 
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school administrators
 
01:49:54.149 --> 01:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
Association here to register our
 
01:49:56.910 --> 01:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
opposition for uh this particular piece
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
of legislation and I would be happy to
 
01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
provide you with some reasons
 
01:50:04.589 --> 01:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
why uh I previously testified in another
 
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh piece of legislation discussing the
 
01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
feasibility of reducing uh saus and
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
superintendant um so I won't repeat that
 
01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
testimony you have that but there are a
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
number of questions uh that arise from
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
this particular uh piece of
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
legislation uh the prime sponsor
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
recognized is that person most in
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
control uh is the school superintendent
 
01:50:29.709 --> 01:50:29.719 align:start position:0%
at the local level so the question comes
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
to mind why then would you want to
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
remove that person further from the
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
local community uh that holds their
 
01:50:38.189 --> 01:50:38.199 align:start position:0%
contract and is hel holds them
 
01:50:38.199 --> 01:50:40.709 align:start position:0%
contract and is hel holds them
accountable

01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
um my lived experiences as a
 
01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent would indicate um either
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
from from any District that I've worked
 
01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
in that the superintendent is a key
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
component of the school community
 
01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
um involved uh dedicated to the local
 
01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
kids the local communities and care
 
01:51:04.589 --> 01:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
about results and what's happening um in
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
their place and if if I'm not doing a
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
good job my local Schoolboard can fire
 
01:51:10.990 --> 01:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
me and that's happened if it didn't
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
happen we wouldn't need a legal aid
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
armor of our association it happens when
 
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
folks don't like when a school board
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't like the performance of the
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
superintendent who by the way through
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
most contracts have a a stipulation in
 
01:51:25.629 --> 01:51:25.639 align:start position:0%
the contract that they are to be
 
01:51:30.069 --> 01:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
evaluated annually by the school board
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
with results with goals uh that's part
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
of just doing business that's good
 
01:51:37.310 --> 01:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
business the thought of having to run
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
for election every two
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
years I I just don't know how that
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
individual who is the educational leader
 
01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
who there are studies and I'm surprised
 
01:51:50.830 --> 01:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't show up in the Georgetown
 
01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
study that stability at the top is one
 
01:51:55.149 --> 01:51:55.159 align:start position:0%
of the contributing factors to Student
 
01:51:57.149 --> 01:51:57.159 align:start position:0%
Success and
 
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
achievement and so I think the the the
 
01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
possibility of having to replace that
 
01:52:05.470 --> 01:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
person every two years with someone who
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
may or may not be an educator who may or
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
may not really be invested in the
 
01:52:12.589 --> 01:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
children and the families of the
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
district is a very slippery and and
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
scary slope you know I I site for
 
01:52:20.270 --> 01:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
example there are 39 towns in Grafton
 
01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
County how could one superintendent
 
01:52:22.679 --> 01:52:23.790 align:start position:0%
County how could one superintendent
possibly

01:52:23.790 --> 01:52:23.800 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
be connected to all of those towns or in
 
01:52:33.390 --> 01:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County's 29 Towns how could
 
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
that's besides Manchester and Nashua how
 
01:52:39.550 --> 01:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
could that person be connected to other
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
communities Bedford marac pelum I I just
 
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
don't know how that works in terms of
 
01:52:49.709 --> 01:52:49.719 align:start position:0%
educational performance and Excellence
 
01:52:52.830 --> 01:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
for kids I think that's what gets
 
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
overlooked uh in this discussion this of
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
this very complex bill
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't think I'm alone in that
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
thinking and looking at the online
 
01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
testimony there are eight folks who sign
 
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill there are 700
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
who oppose it I think that's a pretty
 
01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
clear statement that local communities
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
want local control and the connection to
 
01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:18.790 align:start position:0%
want local control and the connection to
their

01:53:18.790 --> 01:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
I'll stop because I know there may be
 
01:53:27.229 --> 01:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
questions you've got a busy day there's
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
another bill before lunch and I don't
 
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
want to disturb anybody's lunch that's
 
01:53:34.510 --> 01:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
trouble thank you representative Murray
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr FW do you have any
 
01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
Clarity on how County apportionment or
 
01:53:44.189 --> 01:53:44.199 align:start position:0%
reimagining the C counties I'm not even
 
01:53:46.830 --> 01:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
quite sure if within Hillsboro County
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
now we have three mini itcher counties
 
01:53:52.270 --> 01:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to Manchester and NASA or
 
01:53:54.510 --> 01:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
if they're potentially still falling
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
under Hillsboro County as a whole um
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
when I read this piece of legislation
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
but do you have any idea on how this
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
apportionment might affect County
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
budgeting Municipal
 
01:54:06.430 --> 01:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
budgeting thank you for the question
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative Murray I can simply say I
 
01:54:14.189 --> 01:54:14.199 align:start position:0%
don't representative selig thank you
 
01:54:16.589 --> 01:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
very much um and thank you for taking my
 
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
question um looking back at your
 
01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
experience as a school administrator um
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
if you were working with curriculum
 
01:54:28.109 --> 01:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
decisions did was that a decision you
 
01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
would have made alone or was that
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
something that would have been done in
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
consultation with the Local School Board
 
01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:34.360 align:start position:0%
of that specific School District that
 
01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
might have been different from the
 
01:54:36.870 --> 01:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
school district immediately next to
 
01:54:39.310 --> 01:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
yours thank you for the question
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative um typically curriculum
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
is is developed through curriculum in my
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
experiences through curriculum
 
01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
committees set up by um The Local
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%

morning members of the committee bar

Christina school boards Association um I
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
didn't put in a card I had other
 
01:55:58.990 --> 01:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
meetings I didn't think I was going to
 
01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:00.639 align:start position:0%
be able to make it back um in time for
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
this hearing and I apologize um not
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
having heard all of Representative
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
Maguire's um sort of introduction to the
 
01:56:10.510 --> 01:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
bill I'm Flying Blind here a little bit
 
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
um we're opposed to the bill um I think
 
01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
on one of the other bills I talked about
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
um you know the number of school
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
administrative units that have you know
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
in one person's opinion maybe ballooned
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 years or so
 
01:56:25.149 --> 01:56:25.159 align:start position:0%
that's because local communities want
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
their local superintendent and they want
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
to be able to hire the person that they
 
01:56:30.589 --> 01:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
want to hire um so they have a
 
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
connection with that community and is
 
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
not overseeing 25 28 29 other school
 
01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
districts and may not even live anywhere
 
01:56:42.270 --> 01:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
within within you know near near your
 
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
community um I guess some of the other
 
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
aspects too in just hearing some of the
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
the the conversation and questions about
 
01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
putting school boards in charge of um
 
01:56:54.910 --> 01:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
administrative function such as
 
01:56:58.270 --> 01:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
curriculum p uh pupil governance and
 
01:57:01.229 --> 01:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
discipline fiscal Affairs staff student
 
01:57:04.589 --> 01:57:04.599 align:start position:0%
parental safety um you know your typical
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
School Board member has a 9-to-5 job um
 
01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we hire professional
 
01:57:11.950 --> 01:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
administrators to do this within the
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
course of of of of their work you know I
 
01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
know plenty of Schoolboard members that
 
01:57:18.109 --> 01:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
have you know work in Boston I know a
 
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
handful that work in Boston and they're
 
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
running home driving 880 M an hour I 95
 
01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
or 93 they make that school board
 
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
meeting at at at 600 or 6:30 at night I
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
don't know how they're going to be
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
involved with with Educational Services
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
curriculum fiscal Affairs so on and so
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
forth um as the uh as as as the bill
 
01:57:40.030 --> 01:57:40.040 align:start position:0%
seems to indicate um we also have to
 
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
remember too that you know our school
 
01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
superintendents are are the educational
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
experts within within the school
 
01:57:48.629 --> 01:57:48.639 align:start position:0%
district they have higher degrees in
 
01:57:50.910 --> 01:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum instruction and assessment
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal Affairs and the other aspects
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
that go into becoming a certified
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
superintendent um I'd also I don't know
 
01:58:01.709 --> 01:58:01.719 align:start position:0%
if the bill made any changes to RSA
 
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
194c um I apologize like I said I'm just
 
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:05.800 align:start position:0%
kind of looking at the bill for the I
 
01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
guess there are some some some changes
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
here as well to on page seven of the
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
bill I guess but if you just take a look
 
01:58:15.629 --> 01:58:15.639 align:start position:0%
at RSA 194 C4 the superintendent
 
01:58:19.229 --> 01:58:19.239 align:start position:0%

01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:46.639 align:start position:0%
kids are losing out on the end here is
 
01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
do you know uh if there was any
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum changes that it's really not
 
01:59:52.589 --> 01:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
clicking with them
 
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
that they're they're not really
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
excelling in any of this because it's
 
01:59:59.350 --> 01:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
you look on the doe website and it's
 
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
pretty bad uh as far as uh proficiency
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
scores sure thank you very much for the
 
02:00:06.069 --> 02:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
question representative um just to be
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
clear you know I'm I'm not an
 
02:00:09.149 --> 02:00:09.159 align:start position:0%
educational expert I don't know anything
 
02:00:11.550 --> 02:00:11.560 align:start position:0%
about curriculum assessment or
 
02:00:14.069 --> 02:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
instruction um you know you know some
 
02:00:16.669 --> 02:00:16.679 align:start position:0%
people have pointed to I just I've read
 
02:00:18.550 --> 02:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know I I I keep track on the
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
articles of people write relative to
 
02:00:23.069 --> 02:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
public education and in New Hampshire
 
02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
you know I know there have been some
 
02:00:26.430 --> 02:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
questions about um a math program that
 
02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
has been implemented back in 2009 or
 
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
2010 that I think was related to Common
 
02:00:33.189 --> 02:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
Core don't quote me on that but I've
 
02:00:36.109 --> 02:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
seen some some aspects of that um you
 
02:00:38.910 --> 02:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
know Statewide you know I don't I I I
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't certainly don't track what every
 
02:00:41.950 --> 02:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
school district is using in parts of
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
their curriculum it's just not what we
 
02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
we don't have the capacity to do that at
 
02:00:47.709 --> 02:00:47.719 align:start position:0%
the school boards Association so guess
 
02:00:49.149 --> 02:00:49.159 align:start position:0%
the roundabout way to answer your
 
02:00:51.069 --> 02:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
question is I mean I'm not certain there
 
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
may be something
 
02:00:54.229 --> 02:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
in whether or not it's the curriculum
 
02:00:55.109 --> 02:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's the method of
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
instruction that I'm not aware of but I
 
02:00:59.950 --> 02:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
I understand your point sir thank you
 
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:03.440 align:start position:0%

legislation to establish September 17th
 
02:08:17.470 --> 02:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
as Constitution Day so here we are we
 
02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
have American day citizenship day and
 
02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
now Constitution Day but no matter the
 
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
name it represents the importance of
 
02:08:27.069 --> 02:08:27.079 align:start position:0%
knowing about our Federal
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution as well as our New
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution how and why they
 
02:08:35.109 --> 02:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
became and what the distinct honor of
 
02:08:37.870 --> 02:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
being a citizen under the Constitution
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
means what rights do we have exclusive
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
to us as US
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
citizens some of those rights include
 
02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
the freedom to express yourself the
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
right to vote in
 
02:08:52.149 --> 02:08:52.159 align:start position:0%

02:08:58.750 --> 02:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
by jury and the right to live here in
 
02:09:00.830 --> 02:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
the United States are just a few of
 
02:09:04.109 --> 02:09:04.119 align:start position:0%
those rights we have responsibilities we
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
must support we must defend the
 
02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
Constitution participate in the
 
02:09:13.229 --> 02:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
Democratic process respect and Obey
 
02:09:17.069 --> 02:09:17.079 align:start position:0%
federal state and local laws respect the
 
02:09:19.549 --> 02:09:19.559 align:start position:0%
rights and beliefs and opinions of
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
others and of course pay taxes
 
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
and serve on a jury if called
 
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately Constitution Day is not a
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
Federal holiday despite attempts in
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
1987 but that should not undermind its
 
02:09:37.709 --> 02:09:37.719 align:start position:0%
significance I urge you to vote a to
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
pass on this legislation and ensure that
 
02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
children of all ages continue to learn
 
02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
why we have the right to pursue life
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%

taking thank you for taking my question
 
02:10:00.350 --> 02:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
do you think at this point in time that
 
02:10:02.709 --> 02:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
the constitution is not taught in our
 
02:10:05.189 --> 02:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
schools I do believe it is taught in our
 
02:10:07.149 --> 02:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
schools and I believe it has started in
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
a very young grade my concern about the
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution is if you learn the process
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution and it's in third
 
02:10:18.669 --> 02:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
grade when and maybe in seventh grade
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe again if you if uh with the
 
02:10:27.470 --> 02:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
requirements of um um US history I just
 
02:10:31.629 --> 02:10:31.639 align:start position:0%
think that it's an it's a so important
 
02:10:34.629 --> 02:10:34.639 align:start position:0%
in our lives in our every everyday lives
 
02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing wrong with during
 
02:10:40.750 --> 02:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
that week of constitution week to
 
02:10:43.870 --> 02:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
reinforce our commitment to it with
 
02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
education follow and follow okay uh so
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
do you think that the Constitution Day
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
isn't recognized in school do we know
 
02:10:54.750 --> 02:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
that I do not know the Constitution days
 
02:10:57.270 --> 02:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
I do not I do know that the only days
 
02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
that are really um that are only
 
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
recognized under patriotic exercises in
 
02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.750 align:start position:0%
recognized under patriotic exercises in
RSA

02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
18918 are Memorial Day and Veterans Day
 
02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
and you know I think Constitution day is
 
02:11:16.549 --> 02:11:16.559 align:start position:0%
as important and therefore it should be
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
recognized to have special special
 
02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
speakers perhaps special program
 
02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
um it's important okay thank you
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative celik thank you very much
 
02:11:30.189 --> 02:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if you're aware but we'll
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
be hearing a bill later today that would
 
02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
remove um civics government um history
 
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
among other things from our social
 
02:11:41.149 --> 02:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
studies curriculum is mandated parts of
 
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
our curriculum and I'm I'm wondering how
 
02:11:46.629 --> 02:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
you would see if that bill should
 
02:11:50.189 --> 02:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
survive um despite the 28,000 people
 
02:11:52.549 --> 02:11:52.559 align:start position:0%
have signed against it so far um how you
 
02:11:55.870 --> 02:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
would think this bill would fit in with
 
02:11:58.270 --> 02:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
that I think I'd like to take the
 
02:12:00.189 --> 02:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
attitude of let's see what happens with
 
02:12:03.189 --> 02:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
that bill you know um I don't think
 
02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
whether you pass or if that bill passes
 
02:12:10.549 --> 02:12:10.559 align:start position:0%
or fails it really will directly relate
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
to this because this is not part
 
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
something that is going to be in a
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
curriculum it's a recognition of a day
 
02:12:22.990 --> 02:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
so just like when we used to recognize
 
02:12:25.549 --> 02:12:25.559 align:start position:0%
children's birthdays on their birthday
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
in school I don't believe they do that
 
02:12:30.510 --> 02:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
anymore this would be a recognition of a
 
02:12:33.390 --> 02:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
day and not necessarily have to be part
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:38.189 --> 02:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
curriculum representative B
 
02:12:40.229 --> 02:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
Bon thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:12:42.510 --> 02:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um my question
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
with regards to the amendment um on the
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
original bill that was submitted uh you
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
have added an amendment that it shall
 
02:12:51.669 --> 02:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
include instruct
 
02:12:54.109 --> 02:12:54.119 align:start position:0%
how the failure of the Articles of
 
02:12:55.950 --> 02:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
Confederation led to the need for the
 
02:12:58.589 --> 02:12:58.599 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution I'm just wondering
 
02:13:02.589 --> 02:13:02.599 align:start position:0%
why you added that specific um
 
02:13:05.669 --> 02:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
um requirement in as opposed to just
 
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
commemorating and having other
 
02:13:12.270 --> 02:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
activities that would um as you say uh P
 
02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
Allegient Stars spankle Banner in the
 
02:13:16.709 --> 02:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
Constitutions quite honestly I was asked
 
02:13:22.589 --> 02:13:22.599 align:start position:0%
to add that and I believe I could have
 
02:13:24.750 --> 02:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
the representative that asked me to ask
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
that speak to that um I think part of it
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
is is because it was it's a chain of
 
02:13:34.549 --> 02:13:34.559 align:start position:0%
events that occurred in the beginning of
 
02:13:37.709 --> 02:13:37.719 align:start position:0%
us becoming you know a country so I
 
02:13:37.719 --> 02:13:38.549 align:start position:0%
us becoming you know a country so I
think

02:13:38.549 --> 02:13:38.559 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
it yeah just a follow up um and also in
 
02:13:50.069 --> 02:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
terms of the time requirement it says
 
02:13:54.270 --> 02:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
one session or a portion thereof um
 
02:13:56.510 --> 02:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
sometime during the week I'm not quite
 
02:13:58.709 --> 02:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
sure what you're actually asking that
 
02:14:00.669 --> 02:14:00.679 align:start position:0%
you have it doesn't have to occur on
 
02:14:03.830 --> 02:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
that day it can occur during the week of
 
02:14:07.149 --> 02:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
that week um so I think that's that's
 
02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
what it is it does not have to be on
 
02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:12.910 align:start position:0%
what it is it does not have to be on
that

02:14:12.910 --> 02:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:15.629 --> 02:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
day any other questions oh
 
02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
representative Murray um thank you madam
 
02:14:19.870 --> 02:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for my question I I
 
02:14:22.270 --> 02:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
guess I'm curious um whether or not you
 
02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
would see that there might be a fiscal
 
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
impact to any of the education or
 
02:14:28.629 --> 02:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
curriculum required to prepare for it to
 
02:14:32.109 --> 02:14:32.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that you were um putting
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
something forward in a way that
 
02:14:35.189 --> 02:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
addressed things in your uh the
 
02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
underlying bill and the amendment which
 
02:14:40.350 --> 02:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
I do need to look at um so I just didn't
 
02:14:42.709 --> 02:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
know if you had seen that there was any
 
02:14:42.719 --> 02:14:43.750 align:start position:0%
know if you had seen that there was any
fiscal

02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
02:14:46.470 --> 02:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
impact quite honestly I can't believe
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
that there would be any fiscal note but
 
02:14:52.549 --> 02:14:52.559 align:start position:0%
again um uh if possible if they had
 
02:14:55.709 --> 02:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
speakers come in but I think that the
 
02:14:57.950 --> 02:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
possibility of being able to get
 
02:15:01.709 --> 02:15:01.719 align:start position:0%
speakers to come in without cost is a
 
02:15:01.719 --> 02:15:03.149 align:start position:0%
speakers to come in without cost is a
very

02:15:03.149 --> 02:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
probable um certainly people come in and
 
02:15:11.109 --> 02:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
speak for Memorial Day and Veterans Day
 
02:15:14.750 --> 02:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and then our teachers um teaching it
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be someone from the
 
02:15:20.350 --> 02:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
outside I know um I have a friend who
 
02:15:21.549 --> 02:15:21.559 align:start position:0%
has um
 
02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
a child in a school district that on
 
02:15:26.069 --> 02:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
Veterans Day they just have a big
 
02:15:30.149 --> 02:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
program that day and assembly and um you
 
02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
know children who have grandparents or
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
fathers that are veterans they get their
 
02:15:37.870 --> 02:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
pictures and so I can't really see that
 
02:15:40.149 --> 02:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
there would be a fiscal impact on it
 
02:15:40.159 --> 02:15:41.189 align:start position:0%
there would be a fiscal impact on it
thank

02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
02:15:46.189 --> 02:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:15:54.870 --> 02:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:58.430 --> 02:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
Christin uh I'm representative Jess
 
02:16:04.030 --> 02:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh Rockingham District 31 Auburn
 
02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
Candia Chester and Deerfield I I hadn't
 
02:16:10.229 --> 02:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
intended to testify I'm a co-sponsor on
 
02:16:14.430 --> 02:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
this but um I I it seemed that I was
 
02:16:17.589 --> 02:16:17.599 align:start position:0%
called by the prime sponsor to offer
 
02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
some um some background on why the
 
02:16:23.189 --> 02:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
Articles of Confederation uh are
 
02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
relevant to Constitution Day um as you
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
know from our history the Articles of
 
02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
Confederation was the first attempt to
 
02:16:35.190 --> 02:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
get the 13 independent states to uh
 
02:16:39.629 --> 02:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
cooperate with one another and um and
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
and and that turned out to be a failure
 
02:16:44.709 --> 02:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons uh reasons I'd
 
02:16:47.589 --> 02:16:47.599 align:start position:0%
be able to articulate better if uh if it
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
had been part of my public school
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
education at that's a joke um but um uh
 
02:16:57.870 --> 02:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
it it did fail and it created an obvious
 
02:17:00.629 --> 02:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
need for a stronger document with
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
stronger unity and that and that begat
 
02:17:07.629 --> 02:17:07.639 align:start position:0%
the uh Constitution and uh a necessary
 
02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
thing that be was introduced from the in
 
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
the Constitution that was not in the
 
02:17:15.549 --> 02:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
Articles was the uh the Bill of Rights
 
02:17:18.030 --> 02:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
and so the Bill of Rights at the time
 
02:17:20.070 --> 02:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
was thought to be so obvious it never
 
02:17:24.150 --> 02:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
needed to be documented and uh and today
 
02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
the you know we we're in a world where
 
02:17:27.790 --> 02:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
we're the only one with the First
 
02:17:31.549 --> 02:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
Amendment right to speak our mind and
 
02:17:34.270 --> 02:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
that's a that's really a critical right
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important for kids to
 
02:17:39.790 --> 02:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh that uh we could have been
 
02:17:41.389 --> 02:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
in a very different world had the
 
02:17:44.549 --> 02:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
Articles of Confederation U Been you
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
know what what we're governed by today
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
so that that that's my thought on the
 
02:17:52.030 --> 02:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
Articles of Confederation being included

02:18:11.070 --> 02:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
SCD good afternoon my name is Max
 
02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
Goddard I'm a New Hampshire citizen
 
02:18:16.309 --> 02:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
representing myself I'm here to testify
 
02:18:20.349 --> 02:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
um in support of this bill um I learned
 
02:18:22.549 --> 02:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
about Constitution Day in my civics
 
02:18:26.509 --> 02:18:26.519 align:start position:0%
class in 2009 in high school um I than
 
02:18:29.669 --> 02:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
the representatives comments about the
 
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
uncertainty of the future of civics
 
02:18:36.629 --> 02:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
being taught um in New Hampshire um but
 
02:18:39.150 --> 02:18:39.160 align:start position:0%
uh I have actually read my uh read the
 
02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:41.599 align:start position:0%
constitution on Constitution Day every
 
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
year since 2009 um I just enjoy that
 
02:18:48.910 --> 02:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
that day is celebrated in this country
 
02:18:50.910 --> 02:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
at all um I think it would be a great
 
02:18:52.709 --> 02:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
thing to add to the addition of school I
 
02:18:54.270 --> 02:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
don't really know how necessary it
 
02:18:56.270 --> 02:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
really would be but I don't think it's a
 
02:18:59.349 --> 02:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
horrible thing um but I would like to uh
 
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
read just a small portion of the
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
Constitution today um because I think
 
02:19:05.309 --> 02:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
it's quite relevant um specifically the
 
02:19:08.349 --> 02:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
14th Amendment section one all persons
 
02:19:10.750 --> 02:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
born or naturalized in the United States
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
and subject to the jurisdiction thereof
 
02:19:15.870 --> 02:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
are citizens of the United States and of
 
02:19:18.190 --> 02:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
the state wherein they reside no State
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
shall make or enforce any law which
 
02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
shall abridge the Privileges or
 
02:19:24.110 --> 02:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
immunities of the citizens of the United
 
02:19:27.070 --> 02:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
States nor shall any state deprive of
 
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
any person of life liberty or property
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
without the due process of law nor deny
 
02:19:34.669 --> 02:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
to any person within this jurisdiction
 
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
the eal protection of the
 
02:19:41.230 --> 02:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
laws um to close I just have one further
 
02:19:44.190 --> 02:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
quote to read um from a recent hearing
 
02:19:47.790 --> 02:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
last week uh is a quote from US District
 
02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
Judge John cenor
 
02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
it has become ever more apparent that to
 
02:19:56.270 --> 02:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
our president the rule of law is but an
 
02:19:58.870 --> 02:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
impediment to his policy goals the rule
 
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
of law is according to him something to
 
02:20:03.550 --> 02:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
navigate around or simply ignore whether
 
02:20:06.190 --> 02:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
that be for political or personal gain
 
02:20:08.550 --> 02:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
nevertheless in this courtroom and under
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
my watch the rule of law is a bright
 
02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
Beacon which I intend to follow I said
 
02:20:15.389 --> 02:20:15.399 align:start position:0%
this two weeks ago and I'll say it again
 
02:20:17.950 --> 02:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
today there are moments in this world's
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
history when people look back and ask
 
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
where were the lawyers where were the
 
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
judges in these moments the rule of law
 
02:20:28.429 --> 02:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
becomes especially vulnerable I refuse
 
02:20:31.150 --> 02:20:31.160 align:start position:0%
to let that Beacon go dark today as a
 
02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
judge my job is not to only uphold the
 
02:20:35.950 --> 02:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
rule of law but to protect the rule of
 
02:20:35.960 --> 02:20:36.750 align:start position:0%
rule of law but to protect the rule of
law

02:20:36.750 --> 02:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
itself Birthright citizenship is a
 
02:20:42.030 --> 02:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
fundamental constitutional right the
 
02:20:44.270 --> 02:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
14th Amendment secures the blessings of
 
02:20:47.950 --> 02:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
liberty to our posterity by bestowing to
 
02:20:50.230 --> 02:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
all those born in the United States and
 
02:20:53.190 --> 02:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
subject to its jurisdiction the rights
 
02:20:57.630 --> 02:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
of citizenship we are all citizens
 
02:21:00.389 --> 02:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
subject to the rule of law no amount of
 
02:21:02.590 --> 02:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
policy debate can change that and the
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
fact that the government has cloaked
 
02:21:06.030 --> 02:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
what is it effectively a constitutional
 
02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
amendment under the guise of an
 
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
executive order is equally
 
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional the Constitution is not
 
02:21:14.150 --> 02:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
something which the government may play
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
policy games if the government wants to
 
02:21:18.429 --> 02:21:18.439 align:start position:0%
change the exceptional American Grant of
 
02:21:20.830 --> 02:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
Birthright citizenship it needs to amend
 
02:21:22.990 --> 02:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
the Constitution itself that's how our
 
02:21:24.990 --> 02:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
constitution works that's how the rule
 
02:21:27.309 --> 02:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
of law works because this president's
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
order attempts to circumscribe this
 
02:21:31.710 --> 02:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
process it is clearly
 
02:21:35.190 --> 02:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional I just want to reflect
 
02:21:37.950 --> 02:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
on those comments and may they be a
 
02:21:40.429 --> 02:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
reminder to all public servants that
 
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
they take an oath to the Constitution
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I'll take any
 
02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:46.040 align:start position:0%

Thomas and I represent the town of marac
 
03:33:47.070 --> 03:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
a few months ago was approached by team
 
03:33:50.710 --> 03:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
Phoenix 4 robotics Club at the Academy
 
03:33:53.990 --> 03:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
for Science and design in nasua the core
 
03:33:56.309 --> 03:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
beliefs of the academy for design for
 
03:33:58.309 --> 03:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
Science and design reflect the school's
 
03:34:01.189 --> 03:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
dedication to inspiring engaging and
 
03:34:03.189 --> 03:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
challenging students to become the next
 
03:34:06.189 --> 03:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
generation of problem solvers students
 
03:34:08.590 --> 03:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
with not only highly developed academic
 
03:34:11.189 --> 03:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
abilities but also with a keen Global
 
03:34:13.389 --> 03:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
awareness and commitment to improving
 
03:34:16.750 --> 03:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
the lives of others team Phoenix is a
 
03:34:19.950 --> 03:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
community team with 51 team members from
 
03:34:22.550 --> 03:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire it was established
 
03:34:26.790 --> 03:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
during the 2007 2008 first
 
03:34:31.070 --> 03:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
season ASD is a stem charter school that
 
03:34:33.070 --> 03:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
supports team Phoenix by providing the
 
03:34:36.269 --> 03:34:36.279 align:start position:0%
team's shop space the school holds a
 
03:34:38.309 --> 03:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
lottery every year for attendance and
 
03:34:40.630 --> 03:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
due to its small size the school must
 
03:34:42.750 --> 03:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
turn away hundreds of applicants each
 
03:34:45.950 --> 03:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
year who don't make the lottery the kids
 
03:34:47.510 --> 03:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
were talking about this one day and
 
03:34:49.389 --> 03:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
decided to go online and start looking
 
03:34:51.349 --> 03:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
at classes offered at high schools
 
03:34:53.670 --> 03:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
around the state and discovered the
 
03:34:55.309 --> 03:34:55.319 align:start position:0%
reason they believe so many people are
 
03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
trying to leave their traditional high
 
03:35:00.070 --> 03:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
schools for ASD is likely because the
 
03:35:04.349 --> 03:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
same stem class options don't exist some
 
03:35:06.830 --> 03:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
towns have higher level math like
 
03:35:10.510 --> 03:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
multivariable calculus and others don't
 
03:35:12.950 --> 03:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
same for programming classes Robotics
 
03:35:15.830 --> 03:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
and engineering classes then they
 
03:35:18.830 --> 03:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
thought how can we fix this after
 
03:35:20.750 --> 03:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
several meetings the team and I came up
 
03:35:22.990 --> 03:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
with house resolution nine urging the
 
03:35:25.389 --> 03:35:25.399 align:start position:0%
depart the Department of Education to
 
03:35:28.269 --> 03:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
emphasize stem education in public
 
03:35:31.269 --> 03:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
schools these very bright kids are our
 
03:35:33.710 --> 03:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
future they understand that in a
 
03:35:35.550 --> 03:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
changing World in order to be
 
03:35:38.349 --> 03:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
competitive in the job market stem
 
03:35:40.389 --> 03:35:40.399 align:start position:0%
education including software and
 
03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
Robotics is vital they also recognize
 
03:35:45.630 --> 03:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
that if New Hampshire places a prior
 
03:35:48.309 --> 03:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
priority on stem education then it could
 
03:35:50.590 --> 03:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
attract stem Industries and businesses
 
03:35:53.590 --> 03:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
to our state which would then allow kids
 
03:35:55.630 --> 03:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
more chances to stay in New Hampshire
 
03:35:57.349 --> 03:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
for job
 
03:36:00.670 --> 03:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities we understand that since
 
03:36:03.309 --> 03:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
2017 the New Hampshire state budget has
 
03:36:04.990 --> 03:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
included funding for the robotics
 
03:36:07.670 --> 03:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
development education fund processed
 
03:36:09.670 --> 03:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire Department of
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
Education all public and public charter
 
03:36:14.309 --> 03:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
schools are eligible for this grant
 
03:36:17.030 --> 03:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
program in the current state budget for
 
03:36:17.040 --> 03:36:18.910 align:start position:0%
program in the current state budget for
2024

03:36:18.910 --> 03:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
2024
 
03:36:22.229 --> 03:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
2025 there was 1.5 million over two
 
03:36:24.349 --> 03:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
years for this grant
 
03:36:27.429 --> 03:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
program in the latest budget for
 
03:36:30.070 --> 03:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
2425 there was a
 
03:36:33.389 --> 03:36:33.399 align:start position:0%
$455,000 line item that funded the xrp
 
03:36:36.750 --> 03:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
program providing access to xrp robots
 
03:36:38.429 --> 03:36:38.439 align:start position:0%
and training to all middle and high
 
03:36:41.070 --> 03:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire these are
 
03:36:42.870 --> 03:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
positive measures taken by New Hampshire
 
03:36:45.790 --> 03:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
and are greatly appreciated however will
 
03:36:48.110 --> 03:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
be hearing from some of the team members
 
03:36:50.030 --> 03:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
why they would like New Hampshire
 
03:36:52.750 --> 03:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to place an even
 
03:36:55.070 --> 03:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
stronger emphasis on stem
 
03:36:57.790 --> 03:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
education these kids know full well how
 
03:37:00.150 --> 03:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
stem training and education is enhancing
 
03:37:02.750 --> 03:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
their lives and their future and they
 
03:37:04.389 --> 03:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
would like all students around New
 
03:37:06.389 --> 03:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to have the same opportunities
 
03:37:09.590 --> 03:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
to be exposed to stem education and to
 
03:37:12.790 --> 03:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate the economic future that stem
 
03:37:15.950 --> 03:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
education will be open to them we all
 
03:37:18.189 --> 03:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
know that the budget is impossibly tight
 
03:37:20.910 --> 03:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
right now but this resolution is a
 
03:37:23.510 --> 03:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
prayer for from New Hampshire's youth
 
03:37:24.710 --> 03:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:37:27.870 --> 03:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
future in conclusion and I'm going to be
 
03:37:29.750 --> 03:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
reading from the bottom of the
 
03:37:32.590 --> 03:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
resolution this house resolution asks
 
03:37:34.550 --> 03:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
that the general court and by extension
 
03:37:37.030 --> 03:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education advocate for
 
03:37:39.990 --> 03:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
the installation of stem curricula
 
03:37:42.830 --> 03:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire public high schools
 
03:37:44.830 --> 03:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
such curriculums include dedicated
 
03:37:47.910 --> 03:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
courses in robotics Advanced programming
 
03:37:50.349 --> 03:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
engineering and higher level
 
03:37:52.389 --> 03:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
mathematics the purpose of this
 
03:37:54.510 --> 03:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
initiative shall be to develop robust
 
03:37:56.630 --> 03:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
classes in each of the aforementioned
 
03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
areas ensuring students not only be meet
 
03:38:02.070 --> 03:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
basic standards but also gain the
 
03:38:04.030 --> 03:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
exposure needed to build genuine
 
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
interest and
 
03:38:08.670 --> 03:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
expertise excuse me in the previously
 
03:38:12.030 --> 03:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned Fields introducing specialized
 
03:38:14.349 --> 03:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
courses earlier in students academic
 
03:38:16.670 --> 03:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
careers would prepare them to excel in
 
03:38:19.750 --> 03:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
college level stem programs and equi
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
them with essential skills to succeed in
 
03:38:23.349 --> 03:38:23.359 align:start position:0%

is not just a national issue it's an
 
03:40:11.469 --> 03:40:11.479 align:start position:0%
obstacle with direct consequences for
 
03:40:11.479 --> 03:40:12.469 align:start position:0%
obstacle with direct consequences for
New

New
 
03:40:15.309 --> 03:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our state will need to fill
 
03:40:19.229 --> 03:40:19.239 align:start position:0%
nearly 54,000 stem jobs by 2028 this is
 
03:40:21.870 --> 03:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
especially important for Industries like
 
03:40:23.469 --> 03:40:23.479 align:start position:0%
biopharmaceuticals one of the most
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
Innovative sectors in our economy in New
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire alone biopharmaceutical
 
03:40:31.389 --> 03:40:31.399 align:start position:0%
directly employs over 2400 people
 
03:40:33.990 --> 03:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
supports more than 11,000 jobs and
 
03:40:36.830 --> 03:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
contributes $2.7 billion in total

03:40:38.309 --> 03:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
economic
 
03:40:40.510 --> 03:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
output I hope these numbers demonstrate
 
03:40:43.630 --> 03:40:43.640 align:start position:0%
the high stakes of investing in stem
 
03:40:46.229 --> 03:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
education I've also seen firsthand the
 
03:40:48.309 --> 03:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
transformative impact of programs like
 
03:40:50.910 --> 03:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
first robotics which teaches students
 
03:40:52.710 --> 03:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
critical thinking collaboration and
 
03:40:55.550 --> 03:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
technical skills without it I don't
 
03:40:58.110 --> 03:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
think I'd be standing before you
 
03:41:00.870 --> 03:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
today just imagine the possibilities if
 
03:41:02.469 --> 03:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
every student in New Hampshire had
 
03:41:04.870 --> 03:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
access to similar opportunities by
 
03:41:07.150 --> 03:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
supporting house resolution 9 you are
 
03:41:09.469 --> 03:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
investing in our students our economy
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
and the future of our
 
03:41:13.189 --> 03:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
state thank you for your time and
 
03:41:15.429 --> 03:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
consideration I urge you all to vote and
 
03:41:17.670 --> 03:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
favor of house resolution 9 to build a
 
03:41:19.950 --> 03:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
stronger more Innovative New
 
03:41:21.950 --> 03:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you very much for your
 
03:41:25.149 --> 03:41:25.159 align:start position:0%
testimony good job um hold on one second
 
03:41:26.510 --> 03:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
we'll see if there's any
 
03:41:29.750 --> 03:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
questions um yes representative
 
03:41:32.070 --> 03:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
Cel thank you Mr shair and thank you for
 
03:41:34.710 --> 03:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm just curious
 
03:41:37.950 --> 03:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
if this a bit speculation but with the
 
03:41:39.189 --> 03:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
learning you're getting in your high
 
03:41:41.550 --> 03:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
school and then essentially intending to
 
03:41:45.269 --> 03:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
go on for the future if stem education
 
03:41:47.389 --> 03:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
opportunities stop at New Hampshire what
 
03:41:48.750 --> 03:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
do you think would happen in terms of
 
03:41:50.510 --> 03:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
your uh likelihood of remaining as a New
 
03:41:52.510 --> 03:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident I'm sorry could you
 
03:41:55.030 --> 03:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
repeat that last part what do you if if
 
03:41:58.110 --> 03:41:58.120 align:start position:0%
the um support for stem education goes
 
03:42:00.550 --> 03:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
away within the state will that have an
 
03:42:02.910 --> 03:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
impact on your desire to stay in New
 
03:42:04.870 --> 03:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a resident after uh you
 
03:42:06.429 --> 03:42:06.439 align:start position:0%
graduate from high school and go on for
 
03:42:06.439 --> 03:42:07.429 align:start position:0%
graduate from high school and go on for
further

03:42:07.429 --> 03:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:42:11.269 --> 03:42:11.279 align:start position:0%
education um I think stem education is
 
03:42:14.550 --> 03:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
really what opened my eyes to um the
 
03:42:16.790 --> 03:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
possibility and like the different
 
03:42:20.110 --> 03:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
sectors of uh engineering science math
 
03:42:23.189 --> 03:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
and uh stuff like that I think if it
 
03:42:23.199 --> 03:42:24.110 align:start position:0%
and uh stuff like that I think if it
goes

03:42:24.110 --> 03:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
goes
 
03:42:26.389 --> 03:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
away these students they're not going to
 
03:42:28.950 --> 03:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
know what they can do in New Hampshire
 
03:42:30.830 --> 03:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
and I can definitely see in the future
 
03:42:32.389 --> 03:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be a lot of what
 
03:42:34.269 --> 03:42:34.279 align:start position:0%
they scientists called brain drain which
 
03:42:36.630 --> 03:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
is when students leave new students
 
03:42:39.590 --> 03:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
leave their um state to go pursue
 
03:42:41.189 --> 03:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
opportunities in other states you know
 
03:42:42.790 --> 03:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
we need to make these kids aware of like
 
03:42:44.790 --> 03:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
what's available to them so thank you so
 
03:42:47.510 --> 03:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
very much thank you any further
 
03:42:50.670 --> 03:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very
 
03:42:55.389 --> 03:42:55.399 align:start position:0%
much uh Jonathan Gale followed
 
03:42:55.399 --> 03:42:56.910 align:start position:0%
much uh Jonathan Gale followed
by

03:42:56.910 --> 03:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:42:59.790 --> 03:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
03:43:05.710 --> 03:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:08.550 --> 03:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
Dairy good afternoon Mr chair and
 
03:43:10.790 --> 03:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
03:43:13.349 --> 03:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
having me here today my name is Jonathan
 
03:43:15.870 --> 03:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
gal I'm from Nashville New Hampshire
 
03:43:18.510 --> 03:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm also currently a senior at the
 
03:43:21.950 --> 03:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
Academy for Science and design and I'm
 
03:43:24.510 --> 03:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
here today to express my support for
 
03:43:26.630 --> 03:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
house resolution 9 which aims to
 
03:43:29.229 --> 03:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
increase stem education opportunities in
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire schools and I've been
 
03:43:34.510 --> 03:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to attend a school with
 
03:43:37.269 --> 03:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of specialized stem electives
 
03:43:39.790 --> 03:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
including engineering physics and many
 
03:43:43.550 --> 03:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
coding courses but the reality is not
 
03:43:45.990 --> 03:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
every school and not every student has
 
03:43:49.110 --> 03:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
similar experiences like mine not
 
03:43:52.189 --> 03:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily because they lack interest
 
03:43:53.990 --> 03:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
but because they lack an
 
03:43:56.870 --> 03:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity however I've seen the power
 
03:43:58.030 --> 03:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
that giving these students an
 
03:44:01.590 --> 03:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity can have recently at frrs
 
03:44:03.590 --> 03:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
middle school a school just 5 minutes
 
03:44:06.670 --> 03:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
away from my house I helped tutor and
 
03:44:08.790 --> 03:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
start a science club for students who
 
03:44:12.429 --> 03:44:12.439 align:start position:0%
had never even taken a Hands-On science
 
03:44:15.510 --> 03:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
course and when I volunteered there I
 
03:44:17.189 --> 03:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
could feel the excitement as they could
 
03:44:19.189 --> 03:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
barely sit still in their chairs when we
 
03:44:21.070 --> 03:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
would do a new science experiment each
 
03:44:23.630 --> 03:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
week and I would only see the smiles on
 
03:44:26.189 --> 03:44:26.199 align:start position:0%
their faces brighten up every time we
 
03:44:28.990 --> 03:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
learn something new stem gave these
 
03:44:31.389 --> 03:44:31.399 align:start position:0%
students an opportunity an opportunity
 
03:44:33.429 --> 03:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
that sparked their curiosity and their
 
03:44:35.070 --> 03:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
drive to
 
03:44:38.670 --> 03:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
learn and no matter the career stem has
 
03:44:41.469 --> 03:44:41.479 align:start position:0%
become an entral part of our society the
 
03:44:42.910 --> 03:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
microphone that allows me to present
 
03:44:45.510 --> 03:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
today the lights that lighten up this
 
03:44:48.269 --> 03:44:48.279 align:start position:0%
room are an essential part of our
 
03:44:51.750 --> 03:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
everyday lives yet for many students
 
03:44:55.309 --> 03:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
access to sem education remains limited
 
03:44:57.910 --> 03:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
by supporting house resolution 9 you are
 
03:45:00.389 --> 03:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
Bing you are making an investment not
 
03:45:02.790 --> 03:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
only the students of New Hampshire but
 
03:45:04.830 --> 03:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
also the future of our state and the
 
03:45:07.229 --> 03:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
many generations to come you are
 
03:45:09.630 --> 03:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
providing them an opportunity an
 
03:45:11.110 --> 03:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity that will spread from
 
03:45:13.269 --> 03:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
student to student and build a stronger
 
03:45:15.870 --> 03:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for generations to come
 
03:45:17.550 --> 03:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
therefore I respectfully ask that you
 
03:45:20.189 --> 03:45:20.199 align:start position:0%
support house resolution 9 thank you
 
03:45:21.790 --> 03:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
very much for your time and
 
03:45:24.910 --> 03:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you
 
03:45:27.030 --> 03:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:45:29.550 --> 03:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
much for being here thank
 
03:45:31.429 --> 03:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
you I
 
03:45:34.030 --> 03:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
wish I'm sorry if I mispronounced that
 
03:45:39.110 --> 03:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:42.710 --> 03:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
lensy uh good afternoon uh Mr chair and
 
03:45:45.269 --> 03:45:45.279 align:start position:0%
members of the education policy uh and
 
03:45:47.389 --> 03:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
administration committee U my name is
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
oik chakra and I'm a high school student
 
03:45:52.349 --> 03:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
that attends the academy for Science and
 
03:45:54.670 --> 03:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
design as you guys know it's a public
 
03:45:57.229 --> 03:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
charter school where stem is pretty much
 
03:46:00.269 --> 03:46:00.279 align:start position:0%
a big pillar of our education today I
 
03:46:02.870 --> 03:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
urge you to support house resolution 9
 
03:46:04.590 --> 03:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
emphasizing a critical need for
 
03:46:07.229 --> 03:46:07.239 align:start position:0%
expanding stem education across all
 
03:46:08.710 --> 03:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
public schools in New
 
03:46:12.349 --> 03:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire stem Fields Drive Innovation
 
03:46:15.710 --> 03:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
economic growth and job creation
 
03:46:18.950 --> 03:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
careers in robotics software engineering
 
03:46:22.110 --> 03:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
biotechnology are rapidly expanding yet
 
03:46:25.110 --> 03:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
many schools in uh many public schools
 
03:46:27.429 --> 03:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire lack Advanced stem
 
03:46:29.670 --> 03:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
courses that prepare students for these
 
03:46:32.590 --> 03:46:32.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities without early exposure to
 
03:46:34.469 --> 03:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
Fields like programming engineering and
 
03:46:37.830 --> 03:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
applied sciences students often miss out
 
03:46:40.550 --> 03:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
on a chance to develop essential skills
 
03:46:43.349 --> 03:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
and explore careers that are shaping our
 
03:46:46.309 --> 03:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
future I have person ly benefited from a
 
03:46:48.830 --> 03:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
strong education which has allowed me to
 
03:46:51.750 --> 03:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
pursue my senior project at my school on
 
03:46:53.790 --> 03:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
focusing on designing drug Delivery
 
03:46:55.510 --> 03:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
Systems for breast cancer
 
03:46:57.870 --> 03:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
treatment however many students do not
 
03:47:00.070 --> 03:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
have access to courses that spark
 
03:47:02.269 --> 03:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
scientific curiosity and prepare them
 
03:47:04.349 --> 03:47:04.359 align:start position:0%
for Cutting Edge research in my
 
03:47:05.830 --> 03:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
sophomore year I took an advanced
 
03:47:07.870 --> 03:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
biology course taught by an excellent

student at the Academy for Science and
 
03:48:10.469 --> 03:48:10.479 align:start position:0%
design I'm here today to urge your
 
03:48:12.269 --> 03:48:12.279 align:start position:0%
support for house resolution 9 which
 
03:48:14.070 --> 03:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
focuses on strengthening stem education
 
03:48:16.349 --> 03:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
in our state's High School schools in
 
03:48:18.309 --> 03:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
2024 the National Science Foundation
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
awarded New Hampshire an $8 million
 
03:48:21.790 --> 03:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
Grant to advance the state's leadership
 
03:48:24.110 --> 03:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
and scienic Technology this investment
 
03:48:25.670 --> 03:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
will support research and Innovation at
 
03:48:27.630 --> 03:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
the College of professional levels
 
03:48:29.110 --> 03:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
however to fully leverage this funding
 
03:48:30.990 --> 03:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
we must build a pipeline of stem ready
 
03:48:32.550 --> 03:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
students starting in high
 
03:48:34.630 --> 03:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
school right now New Hampshire's high
 
03:48:36.110 --> 03:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
school students need better preparation
 
03:48:38.110 --> 03:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of these opportunities
 
03:48:40.309 --> 03:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
without access the highquality rigorous
 
03:48:41.790 --> 03:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
stem education during their high school
 
03:48:43.790 --> 03:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
years many students may find themselves
 
03:48:45.469 --> 03:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
unprepared to succeed colge stem
 
03:48:48.510 --> 03:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
programs or pursue careers in these
 
03:48:51.670 --> 03:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
fields the $8 million NSF Grant is an
 
03:48:53.349 --> 03:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
incredible resource but its success
 
03:48:54.710 --> 03:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
depends on the students who will enter
 
03:48:56.670 --> 03:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
these programs if we don't equip them
 
03:48:58.590 --> 03:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
with foundations and stem we risk losing
 
03:49:00.910 --> 03:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
the potential of this funding expanding
 
03:49:02.630 --> 03:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
stem education at the high school level
 
03:49:04.110 --> 03:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
will ensure that New Hampshire students
 
03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
are not only prepared to excel in higher
 
03:49:08.149 --> 03:49:08.159 align:start position:0%

stem education in New Hampshire
 
03:50:20.870 --> 03:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
introducing students to stem at a
 
03:50:22.469 --> 03:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
younger age helps them make more
 
03:50:24.990 --> 03:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
informed career decisions and encourages
 
03:50:26.910 --> 03:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
them to pursue careers in high demand

Fields New Hampshire is expected to have
 
03:50:31.950 --> 03:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
around 53,000 stem's jobs to fill by
 
03:50:34.030 --> 03:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
2028 including Fields like software
 
03:50:36.189 --> 03:50:36.199 align:start position:0%
development which is projected to grow
 
03:50:39.750 --> 03:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
by 24% by 2030 and Engineering Fields
 
03:50:41.590 --> 03:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
such as industrial and environmental
 
03:50:43.670 --> 03:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
engineering both projected to grow by
 
03:50:46.870 --> 03:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
18% early exposure to stem not only
 
03:50:48.910 --> 03:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
Fosters interest in these fields but
 
03:50:50.630 --> 03:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
also gives students a Competitive Edge
 
03:50:53.149 --> 03:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
in a rapidly evolving job market
 
03:50:54.870 --> 03:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
research shows that students who engage
 
03:50:56.670 --> 03:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
with stem early are more likely to
 
03:50:58.750 --> 03:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
pursue higher education and succeed in
 
03:51:01.710 --> 03:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
these fields expanding engineering and
 
03:51:03.830 --> 03:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
Robotics programs in high schools will
 
03:51:05.550 --> 03:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
give students the hands-on experience
 
03:51:07.229 --> 03:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
they need to develop critical skills
 
03:51:09.189 --> 03:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
like problem solving teamwork and
 
03:51:11.550 --> 03:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
Innovation skills that are essential for
 
03:51:14.189 --> 03:51:14.199 align:start position:0%
success in stem careers these programs
 
03:51:16.349 --> 03:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
prepare students not just for college
 
03:51:18.149 --> 03:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
but for the workforce enabling them to
 
03:51:19.870 --> 03:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
contribute directly to New Hampshire's
 
03:51:21.910 --> 03:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
growing technology engineering and
 
03:51:24.189 --> 03:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing sectors by supporting
 
03:51:26.389 --> 03:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
house resolution 9 we can ensure that
 
03:51:28.030 --> 03:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students are ready to fill
 
03:51:30.070 --> 03:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
the high demand stem jobs of Tomorrow

thank thank you so much and thank you
 
03:51:51.590 --> 03:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm going to
 
03:51:53.389 --> 03:51:53.399 align:start position:0%
repeat the question I asked the first of
 
03:51:55.229 --> 03:51:55.239 align:start position:0%
of the students who testified and I'm
 
03:51:56.950 --> 03:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
just doing it you know sparingly given
 
03:52:00.870 --> 03:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
the numbers if stem education is became
 
03:52:02.429 --> 03:52:02.439 align:start position:0%
more restrictive in New Hampshire or
 
03:52:05.349 --> 03:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
more limited in availability and access
 
03:52:07.149 --> 03:52:07.159 align:start position:0%
um would that have an impact on your
 
03:52:09.550 --> 03:52:09.560 align:start position:0%
likelihood as a young person to stay in
 
03:52:10.870 --> 03:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the future and
 
03:52:12.710 --> 03:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
potentially want to be here or what do
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
you think the impact would be I think
 
03:52:17.550 --> 03:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
that there is a big chance that many
 
03:52:19.510 --> 03:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
people who want to do stem in New
 
03:52:21.510 --> 03:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm sure there's a lot
 
03:52:24.189 --> 03:52:24.199 align:start position:0%
that they would go to other states in
 
03:52:27.189 --> 03:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
search of opportunities because um if
 
03:52:28.710 --> 03:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
stem gets more restrictive in New
 
03:52:30.149 --> 03:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire then they wouldn't have as
 
03:52:32.830 --> 03:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
many career opportunities and so I think
 
03:52:35.990 --> 03:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
it would impact thank you very
 
03:52:39.149 --> 03:52:39.159 align:start position:0%
much thank you

03:53:28.429 --> 03:53:28.439 align:start position:0%
technology and more it would also create
 
03:53:30.790 --> 03:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
a more stem focused Workforce many of
 
03:53:32.630 --> 03:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
our state's students leave for education
 
03:53:34.510 --> 03:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
and career opportunities elsewhere and
 
03:53:36.990 --> 03:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
never return expanding Advanced stem
 
03:53:38.830 --> 03:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
programs in our schools can demonstrate
 
03:53:40.309 --> 03:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
that students don't need to look Beyond
 
03:53:41.870 --> 03:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to build successful
 
03:53:45.510 --> 03:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
careers in stem fields in 2020 to 2023
 
03:53:48.229 --> 03:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire gained over 30,000 people
 
03:53:51.349 --> 03:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
79.2% being from other states this shows
 
03:53:52.750 --> 03:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire can attract people
 
03:53:55.149 --> 03:53:55.159 align:start position:0%
outside the state to fill jobs these
 
03:53:57.030 --> 03:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
jobs can already be filled by locals if
 
03:53:59.510 --> 03:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
stem education is made more robust
 
03:54:01.309 --> 03:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
various stem-based companies already in
 
03:54:03.750 --> 03:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire such as BAE Systems and
 
03:54:05.550 --> 03:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
thermofisher scientific would benefit
 
03:54:07.550 --> 03:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
from the local Workforce already being
 
03:54:09.870 --> 03:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
trained in stem Fields this would appeal
 
03:54:11.349 --> 03:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
to other companies which would result in
 
03:54:13.309 --> 03:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
more companies moving to New Hampshire
 
03:54:15.990 --> 03:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
and creating more jobs an opportunity by
 
03:54:18.269 --> 03:54:18.279 align:start position:0%
improving equal access to stem education
 
03:54:19.990 --> 03:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
more New Hampshire youth will not only
 
03:54:22.070 --> 03:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
be prepared for high demand careers but
 
03:54:23.990 --> 03:54:24.000 align:start position:0%

03:55:13.030 --> 03:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently approximately 6% of
 
03:55:15.389 --> 03:55:15.399 align:start position:0%
undergraduate students pursue a degree
 
03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
in engineering with Fields such as
 
03:55:19.229 --> 03:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
mechanical electrical and civil
 
03:55:21.990 --> 03:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
engineering emerging as the most popular
 
03:55:23.750 --> 03:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
together these fields represent a

substantial share of all engineering
 
03:55:27.510 --> 03:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
degrees conferred when our team
 
03:55:29.349 --> 03:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
researched engineering opportunities in
 
03:55:31.510 --> 03:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we found that not many
 
03:55:33.349 --> 03:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
high schools offer engineering specific
 
03:55:36.189 --> 03:55:36.199 align:start position:0%
courses by including engineering courses
 
03:55:38.149 --> 03:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
students would have would ultimately
 
03:55:39.790 --> 03:55:39.800 align:start position:0%
have a greater concept of the different
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
engineering opportunities and ultimately
 
03:55:44.870 --> 03:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
providing these opportunities could lead
 
03:55:46.670 --> 03:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
to a future generation that is better
 
03:55:49.149 --> 03:55:49.159 align:start position:0%

Hampshire as a woman interested in a
 
03:55:57.189 --> 03:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
stem career I feel it is important that
 
03:55:58.750 --> 03:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
every high schooler has equal
 
03:56:01.110 --> 03:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
accessibility to stem classes that will
 
03:56:03.630 --> 03:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
help shape their career choices having
 
03:56:05.670 --> 03:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
attended a stem focused School I've
 
03:56:07.389 --> 03:56:07.399 align:start position:0%
personally experienced the incredible
 
03:56:09.710 --> 03:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
benefits that my school has to offer and
 
03:56:11.229 --> 03:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
I feel that students from across the
 
03:56:12.910 --> 03:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
state should be able to benefit from
 
03:56:14.910 --> 03:56:14.920 align:start position:0%

03:56:38.950 --> 03:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
live in Hudson New Hampshire uh I'm a
 
03:56:40.469 --> 03:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
member of Team Phoenix and a student at
 
03:56:41.990 --> 03:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
the Academy for Science and design in

Nashville New Hampshire this year 400
 
03:56:46.590 --> 03:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
students are projected to app platum my
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
school hoping to gain access to its
 
03:56:50.550 --> 03:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
robust stem
 
03:56:53.870 --> 03:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum however only an estimated 150
 
03:56:56.189 --> 03:56:56.199 align:start position:0%
can be admitted due to space constraints
 
03:56:58.710 --> 03:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
meaning the other 250 applicants lose
 
03:57:00.429 --> 03:57:00.439 align:start position:0%
the valuable opportunity to develop
 
03:57:02.349 --> 03:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
early interest and experience in stem
 
03:57:04.790 --> 03:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
Fields like I have while New Hampshire
 
03:57:06.790 --> 03:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
pried itself on its strong Workforce and
 
03:57:08.590 --> 03:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
commitment to Innovation the lack of a
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
critical mass of Robotics and technology
 
03:57:12.790 --> 03:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
companies in our State highlights a gap
 
03:57:14.990 --> 03:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
in the pipeline from education to
 
03:57:17.349 --> 03:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
Industry our students are undoubtedly
 
03:57:18.990 --> 03:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
capable but they often lack the
 
03:57:21.349 --> 03:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
resources and opportunities to engage
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
deeply with stem Fields during their
 
03:57:25.149 --> 03:57:25.159 align:start position:0%
formative years this results in
 
03:57:26.670 --> 03:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
technology startups exploring
 
03:57:28.389 --> 03:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity this results in technology
 
03:57:31.149 --> 03:57:31.159 align:start position:0%
startups not exploring uh opportunities
 
03:57:32.429 --> 03:57:32.439 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire which hurt
 
03:57:33.790 --> 03:57:33.800 align:start position:0%
survivability in the countless
 
03:57:35.590 --> 03:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
industries that we've already
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned in 2020 over 100,000 of New
 
03:57:41.149 --> 03:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's 600,000 employed residents
 
03:57:43.269 --> 03:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
commuted out of state for work and in
 
03:57:45.990 --> 03:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
2017 New Hampshire was ranked third for
 
03:57:48.149 --> 03:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
the highest percentage of workers who
 
03:57:50.870 --> 03:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
worked out of state to keep workers in
 
03:57:52.469 --> 03:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we need to adequately
 
03:57:54.630 --> 03:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
prepare our students for careers in stem
 
03:57:56.990 --> 03:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
and Technology by expanding High School
 
03:57:59.149 --> 03:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
stem education we can build the
 
03:58:01.030 --> 03:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
foundation needed to attract and retain
 
03:58:03.630 --> 03:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
Innovative companies creating a positive
 
03:58:05.830 --> 03:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
feedback loop of opportunity and growth
 
03:58:08.469 --> 03:58:08.479 align:start position:0%
that keeps workers in the state the need
 
03:58:10.510 --> 03:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
for Action is clear by increasing
 
03:58:12.389 --> 03:58:12.399 align:start position:0%
investment in stem education New
 
03:58:14.110 --> 03:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can attract Robotics and techn
 
03:58:16.670 --> 03:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
technology companies growing a fertile
 
03:58:18.389 --> 03:58:18.399 align:start position:0%
Workforce prepared and capable of
 
03:58:20.349 --> 03:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
supporting the ambition of prospective
 
03:58:22.349 --> 03:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
employers the establishment of these
 
03:58:24.229 --> 03:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
companies will significantly benefit the
 
03:58:25.790 --> 03:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
state's economy and that is why I'm
 
03:58:29.990 --> 03:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
urging all of you to support hr9 thank

committee um
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
um I just want to uh thank the students
 
03:58:50.550 --> 03:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
for wonderful testimony today um I don't
 
03:58:56.269 --> 03:58:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:59.429 --> 03:58:59.439 align:start position:0%
add but I think yeah I do have two
 
03:59:03.790 --> 03:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
anecdotes um I when my wife and I were
 
03:59:05.950 --> 03:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
looking for uh a place to live between
 
03:59:07.830 --> 03:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and New Hampshire uh there
 
03:59:09.189 --> 03:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
were a lot of factors but one of them
 
03:59:11.229 --> 03:59:11.239 align:start position:0%
was a good education and luckily we did
 
03:59:14.429 --> 03:59:14.439 align:start position:0%
find that um in New Hampshire um times
 
03:59:17.110 --> 03:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
are changing and stem is really very
 
03:59:19.550 --> 03:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
important um so I think strengthening
 
03:59:21.670 --> 03:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
our public education in stem is is
 
03:59:25.149 --> 03:59:25.159 align:start position:0%
critical to New Hampshire's future um I
 
03:59:26.790 --> 03:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
personally benefited from a strong
 
03:59:30.990 --> 03:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
public education in science uh and um it
 
03:59:33.429 --> 03:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
led to a career at computer companies
 
03:59:37.030 --> 03:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
helping um roll out the internet uh and
 
03:59:38.950 --> 03:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
nobody saw the internet coming when I
 
03:59:40.630 --> 03:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
was in high school and there would be a
 
03:59:43.269 --> 03:59:43.279 align:start position:0%
lot of things coming that we should be
 
03:59:46.110 --> 03:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
preparing our student students for thank
 
03:59:47.990 --> 03:59:48.000 align:start position:0%

04:00:09.670 --> 04:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
speaking I'm moved by
 
04:00:14.070 --> 04:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
their beyond their years wisdom
 
04:00:16.790 --> 04:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
how they're able to make robotics work
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
is beyond
 
04:00:24.030 --> 04:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
me not only that but those robotics I'm
 
04:00:26.590 --> 04:00:26.600 align:start position:0%
an occupational therapy assistant I
 
04:00:28.710 --> 04:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
teach people I'm a professional bosser
 
04:00:30.830 --> 04:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
rner of cute little old
 
04:00:33.750 --> 04:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
people I teach people how to do
 
04:00:36.149 --> 04:00:36.159 align:start position:0%
Prosthetics how to put them on how to
 
04:00:38.030 --> 04:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
clean them how to take care of their
 
04:00:40.389 --> 04:00:40.399 align:start position:0%
stumps all of
 
04:00:44.070 --> 04:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
that these young men and women that I'm
 
04:00:44.080 --> 04:00:45.309 align:start position:0%
that these young men and women that I'm
seeing

04:00:45.309 --> 04:00:45.319 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
04:00:48.269 --> 04:00:48.279 align:start position:0%
here are going to be making ones in the
 
04:00:52.870 --> 04:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
future that can not only grab a baseball
 
04:00:55.030 --> 04:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
they can already do that by the way we
 
04:00:55.040 --> 04:00:55.870 align:start position:0%
they can already do that by the way we
have

04:00:55.870 --> 04:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:00:59.349 --> 04:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
those people like this are the kind of
 
04:01:02.590 --> 04:01:02.600 align:start position:0%
people that years ago I heard about a
 
04:01:06.910 --> 04:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
3D um people that use 3D um printing
 
04:01:10.670 --> 04:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
something I just recently got into they
 
04:01:14.189 --> 04:01:14.199 align:start position:0%
get the measurements for these under um
 
04:01:16.429 --> 04:01:16.439 align:start position:0%
um people that don't have the money to
 
04:01:18.830 --> 04:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
be able to get Prosthetics and they
 
04:01:21.630 --> 04:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
build them it's people like
 
04:01:25.070 --> 04:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
this that will hear their stories it's
 
04:01:27.110 --> 04:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
people like this look at them nodding
 
04:01:29.469 --> 04:01:29.479 align:start position:0%
their heads they're thinking about this
 
04:01:32.110 --> 04:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
right now how can I do
 
04:01:34.670 --> 04:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
this you already
 
04:01:38.469 --> 04:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
are you've already inspired everybody
 
04:01:44.950 --> 04:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
here the world is moving fast
 
04:01:47.910 --> 04:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
we recently had an individual say that
 
04:01:49.790 --> 04:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
the United States is going to spend $500
 
04:01:52.070 --> 04:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
billion dollar for
 
04:01:57.030 --> 04:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
AI just to have two days later a Chinese
 
04:02:00.030 --> 04:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
company come on say we put the basically
 
04:02:03.870 --> 04:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
the same thing together with a keyboard
 
04:02:06.469 --> 04:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
$5 million and some bubble
 
04:02:08.269 --> 04:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
gum that's
 
04:02:10.070 --> 04:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
Innovation that's what all these
 
04:02:14.670 --> 04:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
children here are they malive
 
04:02:18.110 --> 04:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
minds are always looking for
 
04:02:24.990 --> 04:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
answers I hear you your guiding other
 
04:02:27.990 --> 04:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
children other adults little adults in
 
04:02:30.269 --> 04:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
training that's why I say kids
 
04:02:33.269 --> 04:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
are you're guiding the future
 
04:02:35.590 --> 04:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
generations and you're still in school
 
04:02:38.070 --> 04:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
man that's
 
04:02:40.950 --> 04:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
inspiring give these children a chance
 
04:02:40.960 --> 04:02:42.389 align:start position:0%
inspiring give these children a chance
to

04:02:42.389 --> 04:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:02:45.750 --> 04:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
grow some of the people if I may just
 
04:02:48.870 --> 04:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
point out Elon Musk Catherine Johnson
 
04:02:52.229 --> 04:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
herie Thomas Edison Edison Clark lilan
 
04:02:57.510 --> 04:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:00.110 --> 04:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
stem all these people have helped change
 
04:03:03.229 --> 04:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
the world some better some
 
04:03:06.110 --> 04:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
worse I'm seeing the future right here
 
04:03:08.189 --> 04:03:08.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
04:03:11.630 --> 04:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
any questions see none thank you and uh
 
04:03:15.469 --> 04:03:15.479 align:start position:0%
thank you to team Phoenix for being here
 
04:03:20.030 --> 04:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:24.830 --> 04:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
hb9 and um we'll move right into uh the
 
04:03:28.030 --> 04:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
next bill um in case anyone's wondering
 
04:03:31.189 --> 04:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
it's House Bill 283 relative to the list
 
04:03:34.349 --> 04:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
of subjects that comp that comprise an
 
04:03:34.359 --> 04:03:35.349 align:start position:0%
of subjects that comp that comprise an
adequate

04:03:35.349 --> 04:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
04:03:39.710 --> 04:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
education and uh Prime SP sponsor Dan
 
04:03:42.429 --> 04:03:42.439 align:start position:0%
Maguire is U ready to go it looks like
 
04:03:44.510 --> 04:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
04:03:46.110 --> 04:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:03:47.630 --> 04:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Dan
 
04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
Maguire I represent the town of
 
04:03:52.870 --> 04:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
epom uh this is a quite a simple Bill
 
04:03:57.110 --> 04:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
there exists a list in the law in RSA
 
04:03:59.389 --> 04:03:59.399 align:start position:0%
193e colon
 
04:04:03.670 --> 04:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
2-a um which is the list of subjects
 
04:04:07.269 --> 04:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
that must be taught in schools this list
 
04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
has 11 items on it um this particular
 
04:04:13.070 --> 04:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
bill would cut that down to a list a
 
04:04:15.510 --> 04:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
shorter list of
 
04:04:15.520 --> 04:04:17.469 align:start position:0%
shorter list of
six

04:04:17.469 --> 04:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
six
 
04:04:20.349 --> 04:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
um what there's a couple of things that
 
04:04:23.229 --> 04:04:23.239 align:start position:0%
people should understand about this is
 
04:04:26.910 --> 04:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
the list as it exists now has not been
 
04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
04:04:33.590 --> 04:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
law um put was put into law in
 
04:04:38.510 --> 04:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
2007 so for more than 250 years people
 
04:04:41.670 --> 04:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
were taught without the state telling
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
them what to teach
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
right and I've met plenty of people who
 
04:04:49.590 --> 04:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
were in New Hampshire schools at that
 
04:04:51.149 --> 04:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
time and they are
 
04:04:55.070 --> 04:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
perfectly um intelligent and
 
04:04:58.710 --> 04:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
capable the list that was put in in 2007
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
was a little bit shorter than this one
 
04:05:04.950 --> 04:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
and over the years it has been expanded
 
04:05:07.269 --> 04:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
and during that period of
 
04:05:11.990 --> 04:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
time results have not been great right
 
04:05:15.870 --> 04:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:20.229 --> 04:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
the status of of uh people um of test
 
04:05:22.269 --> 04:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
scores and things like that has been
 
04:05:26.030 --> 04:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
declining over the last um couple of
 
04:05:30.030 --> 04:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
decades to the point today where barely
 
04:05:33.710 --> 04:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
50% of school kids can do English at
 
04:05:40.229 --> 04:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
grade level maybe 40% math and a third
 
04:05:40.239 --> 04:05:41.750 align:start position:0%
grade level maybe 40% math and a third
science

04:05:41.750 --> 04:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
science
 
04:05:45.389 --> 04:05:45.399 align:start position:0%
so the one thing the one resource that
 
04:05:50.070 --> 04:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
we have a limited amount of in school is
 
04:05:52.670 --> 04:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
not money it's
 
04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
time and so to the extent that we make
 
04:06:01.830 --> 04:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
the number of required subjects
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
lengthy that means the basic subjects
 
04:06:10.349 --> 04:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
English math science Etc get short
 
04:06:13.590 --> 04:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
shrift right and so I tend to think
 
04:06:16.630 --> 04:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
think you got to walk before you can
 
04:06:21.149 --> 04:06:21.159 align:start position:0%
run and and for schools that where
 
04:06:24.269 --> 04:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
students are struggling in English where
 
04:06:27.790 --> 04:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
they are struggling in math they need to
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
spend more time on those
 
04:06:36.030 --> 04:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
subjects and and not um you know just
 
04:06:40.229 --> 04:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
these these other subjects are nice I'm
 
04:06:42.429 --> 04:06:42.439 align:start position:0%
just because some subject is not on the
 
04:06:44.910 --> 04:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
list doesn't mean it will not be
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
taught but it will not be required and
 
04:06:51.630 --> 04:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
the decision making will move to the
 
04:06:54.349 --> 04:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
local authorities the school board the
 
04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
principal the
 
04:06:58.070 --> 04:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
superintendent and they will get to
 
04:07:01.070 --> 04:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
decide what is appropriate for
 
04:07:04.670 --> 04:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
them I don't think we in conquered have
 
04:07:08.790 --> 04:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
some special knowledge of how to teach
 
04:07:10.389 --> 04:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
or what to
 
04:07:14.790 --> 04:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
teach um everywhere in the
 
04:07:18.670 --> 04:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
State I think that the local people know
 
04:07:21.149 --> 04:07:21.159 align:start position:0%
their own situation know their own
 
04:07:24.510 --> 04:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
student body and can best
 
04:07:26.750 --> 04:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
decide what and how they should be
 
04:07:29.149 --> 04:07:29.159 align:start position:0%
taught and I'm Hy happy to answer
 
04:07:31.109 --> 04:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
04:07:37.710 --> 04:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:37.720 --> 04:07:39.630 align:start position:0%
 
Hall

04:07:39.630 --> 04:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
Hall
 
04:07:42.910 --> 04:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
sorry okay sorry um thank for taking my
 
04:07:45.189 --> 04:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
question three years ago we had similar
 
04:07:47.070 --> 04:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
legislation that was supported by a
 
04:07:49.429 --> 04:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner so my question is were you
 
04:07:51.309 --> 04:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
encouraged to introduce this legislation
 
04:07:53.149 --> 04:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
or is this something you did on your own
 
04:07:57.109 --> 04:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
accord yeah so the way I um the way I
 
04:08:01.149 --> 04:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
came up with this particular thing is um
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
my school board in Epsom is constantly
 
04:08:08.910 --> 04:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
complaining to me about over uh too many
 
04:08:08.920 --> 04:08:10.070 align:start position:0%
complaining to me about over uh too many
state

04:08:10.070 --> 04:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:08:13.790 --> 04:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
mandates right and so I had a meeting
 
04:08:16.149 --> 04:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
with the superintendent and the school
 
04:08:19.229 --> 04:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
principal in Epsom and I said to me okay
 
04:08:22.710 --> 04:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
tell me about mandates right and they
 
04:08:26.109 --> 04:08:26.119 align:start position:0%
pointed to this particular list and they
 
04:08:29.750 --> 04:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
said every time you add to this list it
 
04:08:33.510 --> 04:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
causes us to get a specialist right we
 
04:08:34.750 --> 04:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
don't have somebody who can teach
 
04:08:37.030 --> 04:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
engineering we need a specialist we
 
04:08:38.950 --> 04:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
don't have somebody who teaches foreign
 
04:08:40.830 --> 04:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
languages necessarily we need a
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
specialist and so um
 
04:08:46.590 --> 04:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
so that was the the the Genesis of it
 
04:08:49.149 --> 04:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
was was the my meeting with the
 
04:08:51.349 --> 04:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
superintendent and School
 
04:08:53.149 --> 04:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
principal thank you thank you
 
04:08:53.159 --> 04:08:54.630 align:start position:0%
principal thank you thank you
representative

04:08:54.630 --> 04:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:08:57.870 --> 04:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
Terry thank you uh representative
 
04:09:01.590 --> 04:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
McGuire from the mail that I have been
 
04:09:05.349 --> 04:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
receiving uh I um have the very distinct
 
04:09:07.710 --> 04:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
impression that those who are opposed to
 
04:09:07.720 --> 04:09:08.790 align:start position:0%
impression that those who are opposed to
your

04:09:08.790 --> 04:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:09:13.429 --> 04:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
bill believe or uh believe uh either
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
correctly or incorrectly and so I'd like
 
04:09:17.229 --> 04:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
to give you an opportunity to clarify
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
here that your intent the stealth intent
 
04:09:22.910 --> 04:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
behind your bill is that you're
 
04:09:27.070 --> 04:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
attempting to uh eliminate and devastate
 
04:09:29.590 --> 04:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh courses in these other learning areas
 
04:09:32.269 --> 04:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
the ones that you have crossed out in
 
04:09:34.389 --> 04:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
consideration of the priority that you
 
04:09:36.309 --> 04:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
have given to certain other what we
 
04:09:39.070 --> 04:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
might call Core learning areas could you
 
04:09:41.870 --> 04:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
would you respond to to uh what folks
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
are either understanding or
 
04:09:45.910 --> 04:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about your motives
 
04:09:49.149 --> 04:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
right thank you for the question I think
 
04:09:51.910 --> 04:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
my motives are pure first of all a lot
 
04:09:54.189 --> 04:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
of people complain about I work on the
 
04:09:55.870 --> 04:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
finance committee so I deal with the
 
04:09:57.510 --> 04:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
state budget and a lot of people
 
04:10:00.469 --> 04:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
complain about the amount of state aid
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
to to local um School boards and this
 
04:10:09.510 --> 04:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
bill has zero to do with that right the
 
04:10:13.469 --> 04:10:13.479 align:start position:0%
the way that Aid is we decide how much
 
04:10:15.990 --> 04:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
Aid we have available to give to school
 
04:10:18.990 --> 04:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
boards is a completely separate process
 
04:10:22.149 --> 04:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
it doesn't involve this particular list
 
04:10:26.830 --> 04:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
so it's not about money in that sense um
 
04:10:30.349 --> 04:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
but again it's it's what's motivating me
 
04:10:32.189 --> 04:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
and and I think what's motivating my
 
04:10:34.389 --> 04:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
local school board to say these these
 
04:10:35.830 --> 04:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
mandates are
 
04:10:35.840 --> 04:10:37.550 align:start position:0%
mandates are
unreasonable

04:10:37.550 --> 04:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
unreasonable
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
is the results in in the basic subjects
 
04:10:45.870 --> 04:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
is so are so poor and and you know even
 
04:10:49.830 --> 04:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
if 50% of kids can read at grade level
 
04:10:51.990 --> 04:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
average well there's some school
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere where it's only
 
04:10:56.790 --> 04:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
25% right and there's some school where
 
04:10:59.550 --> 04:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
math scores only 20% can do math at
 
04:11:02.030 --> 04:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
grade level now is it appropriate in
 
04:11:04.830 --> 04:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
such a school that they take time out
 
04:11:06.910 --> 04:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
from trying to do better on English and
 
04:11:10.950 --> 04:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
better on math to to spend time on
 
04:11:13.389 --> 04:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
Spanish or one of these other things I
 
04:11:17.429 --> 04:11:17.439 align:start position:0%
mean those are good things right but and
 
04:11:19.269 --> 04:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure in plenty of places they
 
04:11:22.149 --> 04:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
will still they will have that um
 
04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
because they want to um not everything
 
04:11:28.750 --> 04:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
that's taught is on the list I I'm I'll
 
04:11:31.550 --> 04:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
take my own example so uh one of the
 
04:11:34.510 --> 04:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
best classes I ever had in middle school
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
was a cooking class okay I still use the
 
04:11:40.389 --> 04:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
skills I learned in that cooking class
 
04:11:42.790 --> 04:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
to this day I remember that class that's
 
04:11:46.030 --> 04:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
not on the the list right so plenty of
 
04:11:49.710 --> 04:11:49.720 align:start position:0%
stuff is taught which isn't on the list
 
04:11:52.349 --> 04:11:52.359 align:start position:0%
but the but the point is when you put
 
04:11:54.830 --> 04:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
something on the list you require time
 
04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
to be spent on those things and that
 
04:12:01.469 --> 04:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
squeezes I I would hope we would all
 
04:12:05.309 --> 04:12:05.319 align:start position:0%
agree that reading is extremely is more
 
04:12:10.429 --> 04:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
important than something else
 
04:12:14.070 --> 04:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you further questions
 
04:12:16.510 --> 04:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:12:18.870 --> 04:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
kuger thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:12:21.710 --> 04:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question as
 
04:12:24.550 --> 04:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
a bilingual individual I studied a world
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
language for nine years I ask you if you
 
04:12:29.870 --> 04:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
feel this is a professional advantage
 
04:12:32.349 --> 04:12:32.359 align:start position:0%
today in This Global
 
04:12:34.910 --> 04:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
Society yeah thank you for the question
 
04:12:37.510 --> 04:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
I personally had the four years of
 
04:12:39.750 --> 04:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
French in high school I probably
 
04:12:42.510 --> 04:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
remember about you know that much of it
 
04:12:44.670 --> 04:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
um so I can pronounce but I don't know
 
04:12:49.309 --> 04:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
that I can hear anyways um it's
 
04:12:52.550 --> 04:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
certainly an advantage for some people
 
04:12:54.870 --> 04:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
right to know foreign languages no
 
04:12:57.950 --> 04:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
question about it um but I would say
 
04:12:59.469 --> 04:12:59.479 align:start position:0%
that over
 
04:13:03.870 --> 04:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
time um it's become less and less
 
04:13:07.030 --> 04:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
because we are very fortunate that
 
04:13:09.990 --> 04:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
people around the world are learning
 
04:13:12.750 --> 04:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
English to a greater degree than we are
 
04:13:17.429 --> 04:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
learning in other things right and so um
 
04:13:20.630 --> 04:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
I've traveled ex extensively elsewhere I
 
04:13:23.149 --> 04:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
can get along
 
04:13:26.950 --> 04:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
um so you know again it's it's
 
04:13:30.790 --> 04:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
useful but if you ask me would you
 
04:13:34.590 --> 04:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
rather be able to do math and and deal
 
04:13:40.990 --> 04:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
with numbers at a higher level or learn
 
04:13:44.590 --> 04:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
French to me you got to know math right
 
04:13:47.189 --> 04:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
I mean you you can have a fine life and
 
04:13:49.870 --> 04:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
not know French right but you can't have
 
04:13:52.670 --> 04:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
a good life and not be able to deal with
 
04:13:56.189 --> 04:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
numbers because people will cheat you
 
04:13:58.149 --> 04:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
you won't be able to estimate you won't
 
04:14:01.109 --> 04:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
be able to deal with taxes and money and
 
04:14:01.119 --> 04:14:02.229 align:start position:0%
be able to deal with taxes and money and
etc

04:14:02.229 --> 04:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
etc
 
04:14:06.750 --> 04:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
etc all those things are important right
 
04:14:09.910 --> 04:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
and and French is nice but is
 
04:14:17.269 --> 04:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:18.309 --> 04:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
any further
 
04:14:21.189 --> 04:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
questions follow up followup
 
04:14:24.349 --> 04:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
yes um as a teacher I can't tell you
 
04:14:26.269 --> 04:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a day that I did not speak
 
04:14:28.870 --> 04:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
Spanish to my students or to assist
 
04:14:31.830 --> 04:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
office uh Personnel who needed my
 
04:14:34.990 --> 04:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
assistance um but also I could say that
 
04:14:38.309 --> 04:14:38.319 align:start position:0%
a doctor's office an office assistant an
 
04:14:41.349 --> 04:14:41.359 align:start position:0%
architect I could go on and on that I do
 
04:14:43.590 --> 04:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
feel in the society that we live in
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
today it is an advantage and I'm asking
 
04:14:50.109 --> 04:14:50.119 align:start position:0%
do you feel that there are professions
 
04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
where this is very viable and important
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
sure thank you r s thank you um I'm just
 
04:15:03.189 --> 04:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
curious if you're aware that by
 
04:15:04.990 --> 04:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
potentially having these subjects no
 
04:15:06.309 --> 04:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
longer be taught in school foreign
 
04:15:09.510 --> 04:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
language art technology among others
 
04:15:11.590 --> 04:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
that it would make um our high school
 
04:15:13.469 --> 04:15:13.479 align:start position:0%
students ineligible to attend
 
04:15:14.990 --> 04:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
institutions such as the University of
 
04:15:16.870 --> 04:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the University of
 
04:15:19.670 --> 04:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
Mississippi the University of Alabama
 
04:15:22.030 --> 04:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
the University of Florida among others
 
04:15:24.790 --> 04:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
that all of those colleges require these
 
04:15:26.349 --> 04:15:26.359 align:start position:0%
level of classes for students to be
 
04:15:28.429 --> 04:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
considered well-rounded and valued and
 
04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
that for many students classes such as
 
04:15:34.590 --> 04:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
art or photography or um culinary arts
 
04:15:36.309 --> 04:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
or other things are their Lifeline to
 
04:15:37.950 --> 04:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
survival through their high school years
 
04:15:39.990 --> 04:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
if they are not students who are
 
04:15:41.710 --> 04:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily College Bound but who may
 
04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
not have interest in reading and and
 
04:15:48.229 --> 04:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
history yes thank you for the question
 
04:15:50.750 --> 04:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
so there's kind of two parts there the
 
04:15:53.189 --> 04:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
college student and the and the non-oled
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
student so let's start with the college
 
04:15:55.319 --> 04:15:56.830 align:start position:0%
student so let's start with the college
student

04:15:56.830 --> 04:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:15:56.840 --> 04:15:58.389 align:start position:0%
student
so

04:15:58.389 --> 04:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:16:03.309 --> 04:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
um I tend to think that um a college Stu
 
04:16:06.510 --> 04:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
College Bound student is probably at the
 
04:16:09.030 --> 04:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
at the higher end of their reading
 
04:16:13.550 --> 04:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
ability math ability science ability Etc
 
04:16:17.469 --> 04:16:17.479 align:start position:0%
and so is likely to
 
04:16:22.750 --> 04:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
um want to and go to other classes right
 
04:16:26.510 --> 04:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
and if a school is such
 
04:16:29.229 --> 04:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
that it's really up to the it would be
 
04:16:33.469 --> 04:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
up to the um School Board as to to what
 
04:16:37.670 --> 04:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
extent they want to make available these
 
04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
other kinds of classes right so so yes
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's those other kind of classes are
 
04:16:47.630 --> 04:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
important I mean I uh I enjoyed lots of
 
04:16:50.550 --> 04:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
kinds of classes in my high school and I
 
04:16:54.950 --> 04:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
also went well anyway forgot me but
 
04:16:58.510 --> 04:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
um but as to your question of can they
 
04:17:01.790 --> 04:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
not get into
 
04:17:05.309 --> 04:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
colleges um I guess I didn't have my own
 
04:17:07.070 --> 04:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
personal experience and that's all I
 
04:17:09.830 --> 04:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
have to go by is that I don't think I
 
04:17:09.840 --> 04:17:11.429 align:start position:0%
have to go by is that I don't think I
had

04:17:11.429 --> 04:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:17:13.389 --> 04:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
to I think
 
04:17:16.510 --> 04:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
my Acceptance in college was based more
 
04:17:20.590 --> 04:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
on standardized tests SAT and ACT and
 
04:17:24.149 --> 04:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
all this kind of stuff than it was on
 
04:17:28.189 --> 04:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
did I take a class in French or did I
 
04:17:31.870 --> 04:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
take a class in drafting or you know
 
04:17:35.429 --> 04:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
something else right so um so I don't
 
04:17:37.910 --> 04:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
think in general you're going to be
 
04:17:41.429 --> 04:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
somehow um forbidden from taking you
 
04:17:44.830 --> 04:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
know blocked out of going to college
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
because of uh you didn't take a class in
 
04:17:50.189 --> 04:17:50.199 align:start position:0%
Spanish or you didn't you know that kind
 
04:17:50.199 --> 04:17:50.990 align:start position:0%
Spanish or you didn't you know that kind
of

04:17:50.990 --> 04:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:17:54.510 --> 04:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
thing I I don't know okay quick followup
 
04:17:56.790 --> 04:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
and and it would presumably depend on
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
the specific University thank you and
 
04:18:00.910 --> 04:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
where our state board of education has
 
04:18:02.790 --> 04:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
talked about things like heat and
 
04:18:04.349 --> 04:18:04.359 align:start position:0%
buildings not being essential parts of a
 
04:18:06.070 --> 04:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
core education required to be funded by
 
04:18:08.469 --> 04:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
the state if we eliminate these elements
 
04:18:10.229 --> 04:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
aren't we therefore telling the state
 
04:18:12.149 --> 04:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
they have less of an obligation to help
 
04:18:13.630 --> 04:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
educate our students for the future and
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that our students are truly
 
04:18:18.189 --> 04:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
the best in the
 
04:18:21.830 --> 04:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
nation yeah was was that a question
 
04:18:24.389 --> 04:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
let's let's limit ourselves to questions
 
04:18:28.389 --> 04:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
please I don't think is kind of related
 
04:18:30.710 --> 04:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
to this Bill thank you chairman Celli
 
04:18:32.309 --> 04:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
and represent thank you for being here
 
04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
and bringing this bill for discussion
 
04:18:37.469 --> 04:18:37.479 align:start position:0%
purposes uh clearly um I'm wondering why
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
we call it an ad adequate education when
 
04:18:43.229 --> 04:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
we only providing providing
 
04:18:46.870 --> 04:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
minimum cours work uh and I say that
 
04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
because the amount of courses that you
 
04:18:51.750 --> 04:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated initially particular looking
 
04:18:53.790 --> 04:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
at all the social studies and government
 
04:18:56.710 --> 04:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
piece courses why we wouldn't add change
 
04:18:58.590 --> 04:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
the language in this they call it a
 
04:19:03.149 --> 04:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
minimum education versus an adequate
 
04:19:05.309 --> 04:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
education yeah thank you for the
 
04:19:08.269 --> 04:19:08.279 align:start position:0%
question but I guess I don't
 
04:19:11.429 --> 04:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
see I see the the consequence of the
 
04:19:14.030 --> 04:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
list being the list goes to the State
 
04:19:15.910 --> 04:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
Board of Education the State Board of
 
04:19:18.630 --> 04:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
Education writes rules those rules say
 
04:19:21.030 --> 04:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
You must have X number of hours of this
 
04:19:23.030 --> 04:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
that and the other thing they they fill
 
04:19:27.269 --> 04:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
in some of those details and so um the
 
04:19:31.229 --> 04:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
net result of this bill would be more
 
04:19:34.030 --> 04:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
local control it would be
 
04:19:38.670 --> 04:19:38.680 align:start position:0%
more uh fewer decisions made here in
 
04:19:42.030 --> 04:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
conquer um about what is taught and more
 
04:19:46.469 --> 04:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
decisions made in Manchester and Nashua
 
04:19:50.950 --> 04:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
and you know Epsom um about what's a
 
04:19:54.670 --> 04:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
right for those particular schools one
 
04:19:56.910 --> 04:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
quick followup thank you um just to
 
04:19:58.910 --> 04:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
follow to that the other part of my
 
04:20:01.710 --> 04:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
question deals with one of the things
 
04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
that public education provides is the
 
04:20:08.510 --> 04:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity for students to get an
 
04:20:10.950 --> 04:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
exploration and creation of interest and
 
04:20:12.950 --> 04:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's why they come to school they they
 
04:20:15.469 --> 04:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
may not be focused on science or math or
 
04:20:18.269 --> 04:20:18.279 align:start position:0%
things they may focus on art or music or
 
04:20:21.429 --> 04:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
language and my concern is that these
 
04:20:23.309 --> 04:20:23.319 align:start position:0%
youngsters get so turned off to school
 
04:20:25.870 --> 04:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
because it's so rigidly academic that
 
04:20:28.229 --> 04:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
they may not come to school and if
 
04:20:30.630 --> 04:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
they're not there we can't teach them
 
04:20:31.990 --> 04:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned that we we're
 
04:20:34.269 --> 04:20:34.279 align:start position:0%
eliminating things that may interest
 
04:20:36.670 --> 04:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
students just why they come to school
 
04:20:38.910 --> 04:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
school all kids don't come for all eight
 
04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
subjects or 10 subjects or four subjects
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
most of them have an itch and if we take
 
04:20:44.630 --> 04:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
them those opportunities away reducing
 
04:20:45.910 --> 04:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
their opportunity for inadequate
 
04:20:50.830 --> 04:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
so yes and no so so I agree that um what
 
04:20:58.830 --> 04:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
interests individuals is is a giant
 
04:21:02.309 --> 04:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
variety of of things right so uh what
 
04:21:04.750 --> 04:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
might interest me in a school when I was
 
04:21:08.590 --> 04:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
a student might not you
 
04:21:12.070 --> 04:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
but but don't you think that the school
 
04:21:12.080 --> 04:21:13.229 align:start position:0%
but but don't you think that the school
board

04:21:13.229 --> 04:21:13.239 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:21:15.510 --> 04:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
would understand that
 
04:21:17.830 --> 04:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
argument right
 
04:21:23.109 --> 04:21:23.119 align:start position:0%
um just as well as we do right so don't
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
you think the school board would say to
 
04:21:32.149 --> 04:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
themselves um if I offer music whatever
 
04:21:36.309 --> 04:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
dance um I'm going to I'm going to um
 
04:21:39.750 --> 04:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
Peak the interest of my students right
 
04:21:43.429 --> 04:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
and and so on so so
 
04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's really a matter of again because
 
04:21:49.469 --> 04:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
something's on the list doesn't mean it
 
04:21:52.710 --> 04:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
won't be taught or it can't be taught
 
04:21:55.510 --> 04:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of who makes the
 
04:21:59.550 --> 04:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
decision as to what's being taught and
 
04:22:03.109 --> 04:22:03.119 align:start position:0%
and you know somebody in a particular
 
04:22:07.469 --> 04:22:07.479 align:start position:0%
Community might have a different um idea
 
04:22:09.790 --> 04:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
of what they want in that
 
04:22:12.750 --> 04:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
Community than somebody else please
 
04:22:14.830 --> 04:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
respond to that
 
04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
question quickly please quickly
 
04:22:18.630 --> 04:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
responding to your question or asking me
 
04:22:20.990 --> 04:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
about that I do agree and I think if
 
04:22:23.510 --> 04:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
Conan stayed out of local control and
 
04:22:25.510 --> 04:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
allowed schools and local communities to
 
04:22:27.469 --> 04:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
control within their curricula we would
 
04:22:28.910 --> 04:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
be a lot better off instead of
 
04:22:31.269 --> 04:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
legislative but not we dis assemble what
 
04:22:34.429 --> 04:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
we have here thank you I'm sorry no
 
04:22:37.750 --> 04:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
comments no comments from the uh
 
04:22:39.309 --> 04:22:39.319 align:start position:0%
committee members were here to ask
 
04:22:41.469 --> 04:22:41.479 align:start position:0%
questions and get the opinion of those
 
04:22:43.349 --> 04:22:43.359 align:start position:0%

McGuire um having spoken to us earlier
 
04:22:54.070 --> 04:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
on another bill about the the uh lack of
 
04:22:56.790 --> 04:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
correlation between uh increased
 
04:22:58.469 --> 04:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
spending in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:23:00.309 --> 04:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
over the course of the last 12 years to
 
04:23:03.229 --> 04:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
the tune with respect to uh amount per
 
04:23:06.750 --> 04:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
pupil of 58% while uh test scores in
 
04:23:09.070 --> 04:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
reading and math have declined over that
 
04:23:12.630 --> 04:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
period and have not U increased you you
 
04:23:14.670 --> 04:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
appear now in this bill to be talking to
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
us about the priority of time with
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
respect to certain subject areas that
 
04:23:22.950 --> 04:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
you have identified as uh being uh those
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
that should be considered an adequate
 
04:23:27.670 --> 04:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
education do you believe hearing some of
 
04:23:30.109 --> 04:23:30.119 align:start position:0%
the questions and today and the comments
 
04:23:32.870 --> 04:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
that have been made elsewhere that by
 
04:23:35.550 --> 04:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
spending more time in these shall we
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
call them core subject areas that that
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
would necessarily require the
 
04:23:42.990 --> 04:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
elimination of a host of other number of
 
04:23:45.349 --> 04:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
courses that are offered in our schools
 
04:23:47.790 --> 04:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
is it is it an either
 
04:23:50.830 --> 04:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
or for an individual
 
04:23:53.870 --> 04:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
student I would have to say yes right
 
04:23:56.830 --> 04:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
because a student is there X number of
 
04:24:00.030 --> 04:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
hours per day five days a week and so on
 
04:24:02.630 --> 04:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
and so if you if you're you know instead
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
of spending five hours a week on math
 
04:24:08.510 --> 04:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
you spend 10 well that's five hours you
 
04:24:13.510 --> 04:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
can't spend on something else and so but
 
04:24:16.469 --> 04:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of the entire
 
04:24:19.990 --> 04:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
school um I think they should have the
 
04:24:23.229 --> 04:24:23.239 align:start position:0%
flexibility of saying this set of
 
04:24:27.750 --> 04:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
students needs more math right and and
 
04:24:30.670 --> 04:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
some other set of students they're okay
 
04:24:33.189 --> 04:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
with math so therefore they can have
 
04:24:35.389 --> 04:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
more flexibility or they can we can send
 
04:24:38.030 --> 04:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
them to to other kinds of classes right
 
04:24:41.670 --> 04:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
so so I don't think it's I think
 
04:24:42.870 --> 04:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
students are in
 
04:24:45.830 --> 04:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
individuals right and and we certainly
 
04:24:47.630 --> 04:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
don't know in
 
04:24:50.349 --> 04:24:50.359 align:start position:0%
conquered the details of Any Given
 
04:24:53.750 --> 04:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
student right but but the people who
 
04:24:55.830 --> 04:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
work at the school and people on the
 
04:24:58.910 --> 04:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
school board certainly do know and so
 
04:25:03.990 --> 04:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:07.269 --> 04:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
them thank you representative
 
04:25:09.630 --> 04:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:25:11.349 --> 04:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you see this
 
04:25:14.790 --> 04:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
legislation as dividing widening the Gap
 
04:25:20.590 --> 04:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:20.600 --> 04:25:26.670 align:start position:0%
 
state

04:25:26.670 --> 04:25:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:26.680 --> 04:25:28.389 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:25:28.389 --> 04:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:28.399 --> 04:25:30.030 align:start position:0%
so
look

04:25:30.030 --> 04:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
look
 
04:25:33.070 --> 04:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
look there are when you look
 
04:25:35.469 --> 04:25:35.479 align:start position:0%
at all right I'll give you I'll I'll
 
04:25:39.429 --> 04:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll go partway there with you okay
 
04:25:43.550 --> 04:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
so one I I ear earlier today I suggested
 
04:25:49.269 --> 04:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
you go to this um um education um data
 
04:25:59.010 --> 04:25:59.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:59.020 --> 04:26:12.389 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:26:12.389 --> 04:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:14.469 --> 04:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
and it's to the left if they don't spend
 
04:26:16.149 --> 04:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of money and it's to the right if
 
04:26:17.950 --> 04:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
they spend a lot of money and it's up
 
04:26:19.510 --> 04:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
toward the top if they have good test
 
04:26:21.189 --> 04:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
scores and it's down to the bottom if
 
04:26:24.670 --> 04:26:24.680 align:start position:0%
they have bad test scores and so on and
 
04:26:29.710 --> 04:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
they also put colors based on
 
04:26:33.630 --> 04:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
um characteristics of of the students
 
04:26:34.990 --> 04:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
and one of those
 
04:26:38.750 --> 04:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
characteristics is economic disadvantage
 
04:26:40.790 --> 04:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
right so essentially what we would call
 
04:26:43.590 --> 04:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch right so so one
 
04:26:48.189 --> 04:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
of the the color characteristics is
 
04:26:50.950 --> 04:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
um what percentage of kids in a
 
04:26:53.189 --> 04:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
particular School are on free and
 
04:26:57.269 --> 04:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch right is it 25% is it 50%
 
04:26:58.510 --> 04:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
is it like
 
04:27:01.349 --> 04:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
that and if you look at this
 
04:27:04.790 --> 04:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
data and and you can look at you know
 
04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
every school in the state then in detail
 
04:27:09.990 --> 04:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
you can say what you know tell me about
 
04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
Smith School in Manchester or something
 
04:27:15.109 --> 04:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
it's right there but but there is a
 
04:27:15.119 --> 04:27:16.229 align:start position:0%
it's right there but but there is a
clear

04:27:16.229 --> 04:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
connection between the free and reduced
 
04:27:23.790 --> 04:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
lunch the economic data and the
 
04:27:27.469 --> 04:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
results okay so this the the kids that
 
04:27:27.479 --> 04:27:28.510 align:start position:0%
results okay so this the the kids that
perform

04:27:28.510 --> 04:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
perform
 
04:27:34.870 --> 04:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
well are from higher economic um status
 
04:27:34.880 --> 04:27:35.750 align:start position:0%
well are from higher economic um status
right

04:27:35.750 --> 04:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:27:38.910 --> 04:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
few free and reduced lunch and the ones
 
04:27:42.309 --> 04:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
that perform poorly are from low
 
04:27:42.319 --> 04:27:43.670 align:start position:0%
that perform poorly are from low
economic

04:27:43.670 --> 04:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
economic
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
status uh more free and reduced lunch
 
04:27:49.590 --> 04:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
okay what there isn't a
 
04:27:52.750 --> 04:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
relationship is left to right on
 
04:27:55.750 --> 04:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
spending right some schools the the
 
04:27:57.469 --> 04:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
cheapest schools in our state are
 
04:27:59.309 --> 04:27:59.319 align:start position:0%
spending like
 
04:28:02.670 --> 04:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
$155,000 a kid and the most expensive
 
04:28:05.229 --> 04:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
are spending like 30 or something like
 
04:28:08.269 --> 04:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
that right and there's no Left Right
 
04:28:10.510 --> 04:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
correlation with with
 
04:28:13.830 --> 04:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
results so
 
04:28:18.349 --> 04:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
so the answer is economic
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
disadvantage is a huge predictor of how
 
04:28:25.870 --> 04:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
well people are going to do in school
 
04:28:29.189 --> 04:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
but but I don't see it as
 
04:28:32.550 --> 04:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily connected to this bill in
 
04:28:35.229 --> 04:28:35.239 align:start position:0%
the sense that
 
04:28:40.269 --> 04:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
um somehow I I mean I I certainly don't
 
04:28:42.830 --> 04:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
think that that
 
04:28:47.030 --> 04:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
um spending less time on math can get
 
04:28:48.550 --> 04:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
you better math
 
04:28:51.670 --> 04:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
scores right I I think the opposite I I
 
04:28:55.269 --> 04:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
I think more practice more work will get
 
04:28:57.750 --> 04:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
you a better math score than less right
 
04:28:59.149 --> 04:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
I mean that's the that that's the
 
04:29:03.389 --> 04:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
ultimate premise of this bill and so um
 
04:29:06.229 --> 04:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
to the extent that it's important for
 
04:29:09.309 --> 04:29:09.319 align:start position:0%
the for the the kids and schools at the
 
04:29:13.510 --> 04:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
bottom of scores to move up right to get
 
04:29:13.520 --> 04:29:14.429 align:start position:0%
bottom of scores to move up right to get
better

04:29:14.429 --> 04:29:14.439 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:29:18.750 --> 04:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
scores I think their education has to be
 
04:29:21.389 --> 04:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
tailored to them and they have to spend
 
04:29:23.830 --> 04:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
more time on the basics I mean it's that
 
04:29:26.189 --> 04:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
simple thank
 
04:29:29.469 --> 04:29:29.479 align:start position:0%
you uh see no further questions thank
 
04:29:31.710 --> 04:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
you very much representative uh let me
 
04:29:33.990 --> 04:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
just go over some Basic Ground rules for
 
04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
the hearing on this bill um first of all
 
04:29:39.750 --> 04:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
we give greater latitude in terms of
 
04:29:43.149 --> 04:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
time to the prime sponsors
 
04:29:46.229 --> 04:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh secondly for uh future speakers we'll
 
04:29:47.950 --> 04:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
have a time limit of 2
 
04:29:50.670 --> 04:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
minutes if you have written
 
04:29:53.590 --> 04:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
testimony uh please don't read your
 
04:29:56.830 --> 04:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
entire written testimony summarize it
 
04:29:59.070 --> 04:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
and you can hand in uh your written
 
04:30:01.510 --> 04:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
testimony up front and it'll be part of
 
04:30:02.910 --> 04:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
the permanent
 
04:30:07.389 --> 04:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
record please do not just repeat what
 
04:30:09.630 --> 04:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
we've heard
 
04:30:12.510 --> 04:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
already we're looking for information
 
04:30:16.389 --> 04:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
from you and not just a repeat um of
 
04:30:19.030 --> 04:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
what's been said before we have two
 
04:30:21.950 --> 04:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
other bills scheduled for this afternoon
 
04:30:24.269 --> 04:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
one about now at
 
04:30:29.149 --> 04:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
2:00 uh my intention is to uh recess
 
04:30:33.229 --> 04:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
this bill for a moment while we open and
 
04:30:35.870 --> 04:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
then recess these other two bills at
 
04:30:38.269 --> 04:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
their appointed time and they will be
 
04:30:41.189 --> 04:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
rescheduled for a future date for their
 
04:30:41.199 --> 04:30:43.109 align:start position:0%
rescheduled for a future date for their
hearings

04:30:43.109 --> 04:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
04:30:45.670 --> 04:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
so at this point I will
 
04:30:48.429 --> 04:30:48.439 align:start position:0%
recess uh House Bill
 
04:30:48.439 --> 04:30:49.950 align:start position:0%
recess uh House Bill
283

04:30:49.950 --> 04:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
283
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
open house bill
 
04:30:55.070 --> 04:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
768 which is allowing public schools to
 
04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
contract with an approved private school
 
04:31:01.510 --> 04:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
I will recess that bill uh for a future
 
04:31:05.590 --> 04:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
date and we will go back into now House

represent District 12 I also represent
 
04:32:05.109 --> 04:32:05.119 align:start position:0%
um the all the French teachers that were
 
04:32:08.149 --> 04:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
ever in pen Academy from 1978 until last
 
04:32:11.189 --> 04:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
Friday that would be me I also represent
 
04:32:13.590 --> 04:32:13.600 align:start position:0%

that has performed with me at penber
 
04:32:20.189 --> 04:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
Academy I want to talk specifically
 
04:32:21.750 --> 04:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
about a couple of things that were just
 
04:32:25.469 --> 04:32:25.479 align:start position:0%
said um the I had eight children the
 
04:32:27.109 --> 04:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
eight mahagan children were on their way
 
04:32:29.469 --> 04:32:29.479 align:start position:0%
to Penbrook public schools which stand
 
04:32:31.790 --> 04:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
as excellent as a good reputation in the
 
04:32:35.269 --> 04:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
state until in 1996 the school board
 
04:32:38.070 --> 04:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
given the vicissitudes of the budget cut
 
04:32:40.830 --> 04:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
music K to2 in the district they made
 
04:32:42.469 --> 04:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
that 12 that they made made that choice
 
04:32:44.309 --> 04:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
because it was not required and
 
04:32:47.070 --> 04:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
therefore they cut it that means that
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
pem school stopped offering the heagan
 
04:32:51.910 --> 04:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
Family Singers an adequate education
 
04:32:54.189 --> 04:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
because we were musicians by design that
 
04:32:55.710 --> 04:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
was our decision growing up that our
 
04:32:57.550 --> 04:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
children would do music and so we pulled
 
04:32:59.469 --> 04:32:59.479 align:start position:0%
them my oldest was in third grade my
 
04:33:01.710 --> 04:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
next youngest was in first grade and
 
04:33:04.670 --> 04:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
then we had eight coming along they
 
04:33:07.070 --> 04:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
brought music back to Penbrook I started
 
04:33:08.551 --> 04:33:08.561 align:start position:0%
to give you a history of New Hampshire
 
04:33:10.750 --> 04:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
but in 2006 we hired one of the best
 
04:33:12.349 --> 04:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
music teachers in New Hampshire has ever
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
seen and she restored music to the
 
04:33:17.269 --> 04:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
school and my children who were already
 
04:33:19.470 --> 04:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
singers came and joined the choir in the
 
04:33:22.910 --> 04:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
elementary school my son became a
 
04:33:25.670 --> 04:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
drummer for The Pit bin because because
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
public Academy could not feel the
 
04:33:30.429 --> 04:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
drummer so my background is a little bit
 
04:33:33.029 --> 04:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
personal and a little bit real and yes
 
04:33:35.429 --> 04:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
please stick to the bill yes that's
 
04:33:40.070 --> 04:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
where I'm going um here with with with
 
04:33:41.869 --> 04:33:41.879 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:33:45.470 --> 04:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
the I began teaching in 1978 when jimby
 
04:33:48.590 --> 04:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
Carter came out with a with a study on
 
04:33:50.230 --> 04:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
the effect of foreign languages in the
 
04:33:52.029 --> 04:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
school and the effect your time is up
 
04:33:54.830 --> 04:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
please wrap up in the school
 
04:33:56.750 --> 04:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah Mr
 
04:34:00.750 --> 04:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
Cardell he said that you'll see it in my
 
04:34:04.189 --> 04:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
testimony um foreign language makes a
 
04:34:06.629 --> 04:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
difference in what happens inside the
 
04:34:08.830 --> 04:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
brain and it orders the brain because
 
04:34:11.269 --> 04:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
language is the first thing you did on
 
04:34:13.869 --> 04:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
your own without teacher text or test
 
04:34:15.750 --> 04:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
you perfected your skills before you
 
04:34:17.551 --> 04:34:17.561 align:start position:0%
came to school in the first grade and
 
04:34:19.070 --> 04:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
you were told you can't learn nothing
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
without a teacher and you understood
 
04:34:22.830 --> 04:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
them perfectly because you had already
 
04:34:25.349 --> 04:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
perfected your skills what language does
 
04:34:28.230 --> 04:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
is it restores you to where you were on
 
04:34:30.189 --> 04:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
your own learning on your own thank you
 
04:34:32.109 --> 04:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony any
 
04:34:34.590 --> 04:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative see
 
04:34:36.429 --> 04:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much is
 
04:34:38.349 --> 04:34:38.359 align:start position:0%

wheeler
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
please get ready um thank you very much
 
04:34:47.349 --> 04:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'm representive Timothy Horgan
 
04:34:49.189 --> 04:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
from straford County District 10 the
 
04:34:51.310 --> 04:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
town of Durham and I'm pleased to see
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
one of my fellow straford County
 
04:34:54.470 --> 04:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
District 10 members uh behind the
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
committee table and she brought up a
 
04:34:59.709 --> 04:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
very important Point already which is uh
 
04:35:01.349 --> 04:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
educational institutions such as
 
04:35:04.230 --> 04:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire or also put
 
04:35:06.750 --> 04:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
a plug for outstanding Community College
 
04:35:08.470 --> 04:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
in next town over Great Bay Community
 
04:35:11.709 --> 04:35:11.719 align:start position:0%
College so students if they had an
 
04:35:13.470 --> 04:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
education that was ostensibly adequate
 
04:35:15.189 --> 04:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
that was limited to what's in this bill
 
04:35:17.310 --> 04:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
they would probably have great
 
04:35:20.070 --> 04:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
difficulty being admitted to those
 
04:35:22.750 --> 04:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
institutions um one thing would they
 
04:35:24.910 --> 04:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
were going on about the test scores I
 
04:35:26.750 --> 04:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
used to work in for an educational
 
04:35:29.990 --> 04:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
testing company those tests first of all
 
04:35:32.949 --> 04:35:32.959 align:start position:0%
um are very are not very exact they're
 
04:35:34.830 --> 04:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
not it's not a very exact science I know
 
04:35:36.510 --> 04:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
especially I used to score openend into
 
04:35:38.109 --> 04:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
questions on math tests and you would
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
see a lot of cases of young people
 
04:35:42.070 --> 04:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
trying very hard to answer questions
 
04:35:44.830 --> 04:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
when they actually obviously understood
 
04:35:47.189 --> 04:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
the math but couldn't figure out how to
 
04:35:48.750 --> 04:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
answer you know the word questions they
 
04:35:50.629 --> 04:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
were posed with and that's an issue with
 
04:35:53.390 --> 04:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
other subject areas and also just in
 
04:35:55.670 --> 04:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
general kids want to learn to read write
 
04:35:57.189 --> 04:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
do math all the other things because
 
04:35:59.029 --> 04:35:59.039 align:start position:0%
they want to learn about things so
 
04:36:01.230 --> 04:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
taking out things like history and
 
04:36:04.189 --> 04:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
technology and all these other things is
 
04:36:08.269 --> 04:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
um just uh just totally totally wrong so
 
04:36:09.830 --> 04:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
kids the reason kids want to learn to
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
read want to learn to do math and all
 
04:36:12.910 --> 04:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
these basic skills is because they want
 
04:36:14.470 --> 04:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to do things and learn about
 
04:36:17.189 --> 04:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
the world you know so just drilling them
 
04:36:19.029 --> 04:36:19.039 align:start position:0%
on those subjects that can get extremely
 
04:36:21.029 --> 04:36:21.039 align:start position:0%
boring um especially when the drills
 
04:36:21.949 --> 04:36:21.959 align:start position:0%
they're putting through are not
 
04:36:24.629 --> 04:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily that well thought out and to
 
04:36:26.949 --> 04:36:26.959 align:start position:0%
double back to the testing things they
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
don't those testing standards uh even
 
04:36:30.949 --> 04:36:30.959 align:start position:0%
though I said the tests were bad the
 
04:36:32.949 --> 04:36:32.959 align:start position:0%
companies that put the tests together
 
04:36:35.230 --> 04:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
think have good intentions and the tests
 
04:36:37.150 --> 04:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
uh don't remain constant over time they
 
04:36:39.789 --> 04:36:39.799 align:start position:0%
do tend to get at least their goals tend
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
to get higher over time so they they
 
04:36:43.830 --> 04:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
they want to improve standards so the
 
04:36:46.629 --> 04:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
you know saying the test scores um
 
04:36:48.390 --> 04:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
aren't aren't getting any better ignores
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that the tests are not staying
 
04:36:51.670 --> 04:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
the same over time so I just I think
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
this bill is just an extremely bad idea
 
04:36:58.590 --> 04:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
and uh it should be um itl maybe even
 
04:37:00.390 --> 04:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
indefinitely postponed when it gets to
 
04:37:03.290 --> 04:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
the floor as soon as possible
 
04:37:03.300 --> 04:37:06.189 align:start position:0%
the floor as soon as possible

legislature the legislation that we have
 
04:37:40.750 --> 04:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
before us here is about the definition
 
04:37:43.109 --> 04:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
of what an quate education is and to me
 
04:37:45.949 --> 04:37:45.959 align:start position:0%
in the 21st century technology
 
04:37:47.910 --> 04:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
engineering that is an adequate
 
04:37:50.629 --> 04:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
education to me in the 21st
 
04:37:52.949 --> 04:37:52.959 align:start position:0%
century the things that we have here in
 
04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation whether they be the
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%

education all of those things which have
 
04:38:13.150 --> 04:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
been struck from this spill this law
 
04:38:14.949 --> 04:38:14.959 align:start position:0%
that are trying to become law is
 
04:38:16.510 --> 04:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
striking this from this spill that's all
 
04:38:19.590 --> 04:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
part of an adequate education we know if
 
04:38:22.150 --> 04:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
you walk the streets the lack of civics
 
04:38:24.470 --> 04:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
education that exists here in the state
 
04:38:26.429 --> 04:38:26.439 align:start position:0%
now we need to be boosting Civics
 
04:38:28.230 --> 04:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
education not getting rid of it as a
 
04:38:30.629 --> 04:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
requirement we need to be boosting our
 
04:38:30.639 --> 04:38:32.230 align:start position:0%
requirement we need to be boosting our
technological

04:38:32.230 --> 04:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
technological
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
education standards not getting rid of
 
04:38:37.590 --> 04:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
them as a requirements this is the 21st
 
04:38:40.670 --> 04:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
century and while as representative
 
04:38:42.310 --> 04:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
Maguire said getting rid of this from
 
04:38:44.390 --> 04:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
chaptered law may not mean that every
 
04:38:47.470 --> 04:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
student in the state doesn't get taught
 
04:38:49.189 --> 04:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
these important subjects what it does
 
04:38:51.949 --> 04:38:51.959 align:start position:0%
mean is for the schools who can't afford
 
04:38:54.390 --> 04:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
these subjects that they will drop them
 
04:38:55.949 --> 04:38:55.959 align:start position:0%
from the list and to answer your
 
04:38:57.910 --> 04:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
question representative Hall that does
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
create a situation of the halves and the
 
04:39:01.830 --> 04:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
hav knots I come from conal very
 
04:39:03.949 --> 04:39:03.959 align:start position:0%
well-funded School 10 minutes down the
 
04:39:07.070 --> 04:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
road is Conan a very well underfunded
 
04:39:09.429 --> 04:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
school just because of the property
 
04:39:11.709 --> 04:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
taxes in that District if we were to get
 
04:39:14.070 --> 04:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
rid of these requirements a school like
 
04:39:15.310 --> 04:39:15.320 align:start position:0%
component would say well we don't have
 
04:39:16.990 --> 04:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
to require these things we're not going
 
04:39:18.869 --> 04:39:18.879 align:start position:0%
to teach them anymore and then those
 
04:39:21.429 --> 04:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
kids are set back even farther than they
 
04:39:23.869 --> 04:39:23.879 align:start position:0%
already are from the lack of equal
 
04:39:25.310 --> 04:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
education that we have here in our state
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
so let's not set our kids back in the
 
04:39:29.551 --> 04:39:29.561 align:start position:0%
state of no Hampshire let's make sure
 
04:39:30.869 --> 04:39:30.879 align:start position:0%
they have an adequate education that
 
04:39:33.150 --> 04:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
meets the needs of the 21st century I

celik

04:39:42.110 --> 04:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
celik
 
04:39:43.590 --> 04:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:39:46.150 --> 04:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
question as one of our uh youngest
 
04:39:48.190 --> 04:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
although no longer the youngest members
 
04:39:51.550 --> 04:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
of the House of this body would you say
 
04:39:53.590 --> 04:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
that Civics education or some other
 
04:39:54.948 --> 04:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
aspect of your education had an
 
04:39:56.550 --> 04:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
influence in you're choosing to run for
 
04:39:59.628 --> 04:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:01.948 --> 04:40:01.958 align:start position:0%
18-year-old well I was bad at school so
 
04:40:03.868 --> 04:40:03.878 align:start position:0%
I can't I I want to answer it
 
04:40:08.510 --> 04:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
truthfully but uh what I can say is the
 
04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
lack of a civic education means that my
 
04:40:13.310 --> 04:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
students the people who are my peers
 
04:40:14.948 --> 04:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going they say you're
 
04:40:17.350 --> 04:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
in politics Jonah but they have no idea
 
04:40:19.550 --> 04:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
what we do here in the legislature and
 
04:40:21.230 --> 04:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
we're so connected to the people here
 
04:40:23.430 --> 04:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative Cel as we see here with
 
04:40:25.948 --> 04:40:25.958 align:start position:0%
all those that came out to testify and
 
04:40:28.390 --> 04:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
the 28,000 that came to sign in on this
 
04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation it's so important
 
04:40:32.310 --> 04:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
to have people civically engaged in
 
04:40:34.830 --> 04:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
their government because we are the
 
04:40:37.230 --> 04:40:37.240 align:start position:0%
government and the more that we can
 
04:40:38.868 --> 04:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
teach that and the more that we can make
 
04:40:41.270 --> 04:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
the principles of this United States con
 
04:40:42.830 --> 04:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the constitution of the
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire known to
 
04:40:46.230 --> 04:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
everybody the better off our country
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
will be thank you very much thank you
 
04:40:50.628 --> 04:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
04:40:53.310 --> 04:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:40:55.030 --> 04:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
coming here and
 
04:40:58.350 --> 04:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
testifying so good leader is a good
 
04:40:58.360 --> 04:41:00.390 align:start position:0%
testifying so good leader is a good
listener

04:41:00.390 --> 04:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
listener
 
04:41:03.948 --> 04:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
and they also listen to the people who
 
04:41:08.230 --> 04:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
work for them uh and to get the good
 
04:41:11.788 --> 04:41:11.798 align:start position:0%
ideas how to make the machine work uh um
 
04:41:15.310 --> 04:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
so my question is uh is there a general
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
consensus of what is the core problem of
 
04:41:22.910 --> 04:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
why we're doing so uh not so good in
 
04:41:27.270 --> 04:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
some subjects uh is it the curriculum is
 
04:41:29.430 --> 04:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
there a curriculum change is there
 
04:41:31.350 --> 04:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
distraction I mean I'm looking for
 
04:41:33.550 --> 04:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
answers from teachers and I've talked to
 
04:41:36.788 --> 04:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
a few and I'm still getting some
 
04:41:40.030 --> 04:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
information uh but what is the core that
 
04:41:42.110 --> 04:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
we need to look at
 
04:41:43.628 --> 04:41:43.638 align:start position:0%
representative na that's a great
 
04:41:45.990 --> 04:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
question there are teachers and parents
 
04:41:47.868 --> 04:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
and principles and representatives
 
04:41:49.590 --> 04:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
behind me who could probably answer it
 
04:41:51.470 --> 04:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
better but what I'd say is and I know
 
04:41:53.910 --> 04:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
this is a controversial subject but the
 
04:41:56.270 --> 04:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
state house at least voted on a
 
04:41:58.708 --> 04:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan basis to move forward some
 
04:42:00.868 --> 04:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
legislation around this in the last bium
 
04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'd say the state has uh forked its
 
04:42:06.070 --> 04:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility to adequately fund our
 
04:42:08.110 --> 04:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
Public Schools over the course of so
 
04:42:10.030 --> 04:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
many decades and if we were to
 
04:42:12.470 --> 04:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
adequately fund our public schools then
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
the gaps that we're seeing in the public
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
schools would not exist as much as we
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
do thank thank
 
04:42:23.590 --> 04:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
you representative kuger I'm trying to
 
04:42:23.600 --> 04:42:24.550 align:start position:0%
you representative kuger I'm trying to
pull

04:42:24.550 --> 04:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
pull
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
away thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative I just wanted to make
 
04:42:31.310 --> 04:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
sure that I've heard you correctly would
 
04:42:34.030 --> 04:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
you concur that an illustrator an
 
04:42:36.190 --> 04:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
architect a graphic designer would
 
04:42:39.788 --> 04:42:39.798 align:start position:0%
benefit from art classes in high school
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative
 
04:42:43.708 --> 04:42:43.718 align:start position:0%
it's so important we think of art oh
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
just sketches on paper but as
 
04:42:48.550 --> 04:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
representative seling pointed out in her
 
04:42:51.230 --> 04:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
question to the prime sponsor art
 
04:42:51.240 --> 04:42:52.708 align:start position:0%
question to the prime sponsor art
education

04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:42:55.708 --> 04:42:55.718 align:start position:0%
these what are called elective subjects
 
04:42:57.948 --> 04:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
in school are sometimes the most
 
04:43:00.670 --> 04:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
important subject of the day because of
 
04:43:02.310 --> 04:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
the career path that it might lead
 
04:43:04.708 --> 04:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
someone on just drawing on paper and
 
04:43:07.310 --> 04:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
building buildings I have a few peers of
 
04:43:09.150 --> 04:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
mine who are going off into architecture
 
04:43:11.590 --> 04:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
because of the amazing drawing that they
 
04:43:13.230 --> 04:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
draw as a kid and you could tell that
 
04:43:14.550 --> 04:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
they'd be an architecture today just
 
04:43:16.708 --> 04:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
based off those drawings but it also is
 
04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
important because that's sometimes the
 
04:43:20.708 --> 04:43:20.718 align:start position:0%
only respit that a student has
 
04:43:22.708 --> 04:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
throughout the day is that moment with
 
04:43:25.350 --> 04:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
the art teacher the the freedom they get
 
04:43:28.550 --> 04:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
in a music class the specials and the
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
specialist subjects are so important for
 
04:43:32.510 --> 04:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
our kids so that we're not putting them
 
04:43:34.708 --> 04:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
in a box and making education so rigid
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
as you put representative Woodcock thank
 
04:43:39.750 --> 04:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh thank you very
 
04:43:42.670 --> 04:43:42.680 align:start position:0%

04:43:54.190 --> 04:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:57.150 --> 04:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
Ryan thank you chairman cordelli nice to
 
04:43:58.868 --> 04:43:58.878 align:start position:0%
see you and the other members of the
 
04:44:02.310 --> 04:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
committee again um not on this subject
 
04:44:06.470 --> 04:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
though uh I think this has been uh well
 
04:44:09.868 --> 04:44:09.878 align:start position:0%
discussed by the legislature over time
 
04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh the product of the legislature is
 
04:44:15.628 --> 04:44:15.638 align:start position:0%
what is in statute uh and I don't think
 
04:44:17.910 --> 04:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
that this bill is in the best interest
 
04:44:20.868 --> 04:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
of the State uh we have a constitutional
 
04:44:23.550 --> 04:44:23.560 align:start position:0%
mandate that says and has stood up over
 
04:44:27.628 --> 04:44:27.638 align:start position:0%
time we are public education is to
 
04:44:30.750 --> 04:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
prepare students to assume responsible
 
04:44:35.270 --> 04:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
positions in Commerce in technology in
 
04:44:38.990 --> 04:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh in in agriculture in manufacturing
 
04:44:41.788 --> 04:44:41.798 align:start position:0%
this is what's in our basic
 
04:44:41.798 --> 04:44:44.910 align:start position:0%
this is what's in our basic
Constitution

04:44:44.910 --> 04:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:51.270 --> 04:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
um we are we we are needing to prepare
 
04:44:54.868 --> 04:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
our students AS Global Citizens to be
 
04:44:58.628 --> 04:44:58.638 align:start position:0%
responsible adults we know the debt load
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
that our students are facing when they
 
04:45:04.830 --> 04:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
leave and become 18 leave the public
 
04:45:08.628 --> 04:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
schools uh we want them to be engaged
 
04:45:12.030 --> 04:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
citizens and that is the subject around
 
04:45:15.628 --> 04:45:15.638 align:start position:0%
those details in the social sciences uh
 
04:45:18.390 --> 04:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
we want them to be technologically
 
04:45:22.550 --> 04:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
prepared these this section of statutes
 
04:45:27.030 --> 04:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
has evolved over time uh Agriculture and
 
04:45:30.628 --> 04:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
cooking uh were a part of a mandated
 
04:45:33.830 --> 04:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
education and aren't any longer these
 
04:45:36.550 --> 04:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
rules evolve and I'll give you just a
 
04:45:39.470 --> 04:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
sense of where who who was behind some
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%

wolf these are not left-wing kinds of
 
04:46:24.390 --> 04:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
people uh coming up with uh woke
 
04:46:28.548 --> 04:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
curriculum this is uh the the basic
 
04:46:31.070 --> 04:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
needs of that
 
04:46:34.430 --> 04:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
technologically prepared Global citizen
 
04:46:37.150 --> 04:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
responsible adults that should be the
 
04:46:39.590 --> 04:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
goal of Education in the state and in
 
04:46:42.830 --> 04:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
fact I I think think this the sponsor uh
 
04:46:46.110 --> 04:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
should look uh further in in statute of
 
04:46:50.470 --> 04:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
193 and find that uh in fact it says the
 
04:46:52.788 --> 04:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
policy of New Hampshire for elementary
 
04:46:55.310 --> 04:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
secondary education is to prepare for
 
04:46:57.548 --> 04:46:57.558 align:start position:0%
successful participation in social
 
04:47:00.070 --> 04:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
economic scientific technological and
 
04:47:03.390 --> 04:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
political systems and yes languages and
 
04:47:06.310 --> 04:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
arts and culture are are things that
 
04:47:09.590 --> 04:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
prepare the mind for uh in different
 
04:47:11.390 --> 04:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
ways so that some students students can
 
04:47:14.110 --> 04:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
succeed where they may not succeed in
 
04:47:15.708 --> 04:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
other things I just want two other
 
04:47:18.830 --> 04:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
points one quickly if you could students
 
04:47:23.230 --> 04:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
uh have math and English throughout
 
04:47:27.150 --> 04:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
every 12 years of of of schooling in the
 
04:47:30.230 --> 04:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
state and second that our current
 
04:47:33.910 --> 04:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
structure has New Hampshire continuously
 
04:47:36.788 --> 04:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
in the top five performing states in the
 
04:47:40.150 --> 04:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
nation don't change this section of
 
04:47:42.548 --> 04:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
statute and oppose this Bill thank you
 
04:47:44.230 --> 04:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
very much thank you very
 
04:47:48.590 --> 04:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
much next is um representative
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:01.230 --> 04:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
Ryan good afternoon thank you Mr
 
04:48:03.190 --> 04:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you to the
 
04:48:05.670 --> 04:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
committee uh let's be clear about one
 
04:48:09.110 --> 04:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
thing if this bill passes into law UNH
 
04:48:11.390 --> 04:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
will not be able to accept an
 
04:48:13.628 --> 04:48:13.638 align:start position:0%
application from a single high school
 
04:48:16.310 --> 04:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
graduate in New Hampshire because they
 
04:48:18.390 --> 04:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
have a requirement for two years of a
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
language and they have other
 
04:48:24.150 --> 04:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
requirements just to apply now if UNH
 
04:48:26.948 --> 04:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
drops its standards to to allow this to
 
04:48:28.990 --> 04:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
happen then they'll lose their
 
04:48:31.830 --> 04:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
accreditation because the the Nei
 
04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
accreditation is very clear on this
 
04:48:38.470 --> 04:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
general education uh referred to as the
 
04:48:41.150 --> 04:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
Arts and Sciences you have to have them
 
04:48:43.590 --> 04:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
in a higher education
 
04:48:46.190 --> 04:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
institution it could
 
04:48:49.788 --> 04:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
cost them those colleges that drop their
 
04:48:52.350 --> 04:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
standards to allow this to happen and
 
04:48:55.910 --> 04:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
have students come in at variance to not
 
04:48:58.590 --> 04:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
get their uh not get to
 
04:49:02.350 --> 04:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
college now the Constitution says more
 
04:49:03.948 --> 04:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
than what was just
 
04:49:06.670 --> 04:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
read the Constitution actually has
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum in it it says it shall be the
 
04:49:12.350 --> 04:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
duty of the legisl Lors to encourage
 
04:49:14.270 --> 04:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
private and public
 
04:49:16.708 --> 04:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
institutions rewards and immunities for
 
04:49:19.350 --> 04:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
the promotion of Agriculture Arts
 
04:49:22.788 --> 04:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
sciences and commerce that's in the
 
04:49:22.798 --> 04:49:24.510 align:start position:0%
sciences and commerce that's in the
Constitutional

04:49:24.510 --> 04:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
Constitutional
 
04:49:26.830 --> 04:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
mandate I finished with I looked I
 
04:49:29.990 --> 04:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
looked at other colleges about what they
 
04:49:33.548 --> 04:49:33.558 align:start position:0%
require and I found one that was very
 
04:49:35.948 --> 04:49:35.958 align:start position:0%
interesting it happens to be the alma
 
04:49:38.948 --> 04:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
moer of two members of the house uh
 
04:49:40.990 --> 04:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
finance committee I think I think it's
 
04:49:41.000 --> 04:49:42.310 align:start position:0%
finance committee I think I think it's
called

04:49:42.310 --> 04:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
called
 
04:49:46.708 --> 04:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
MIT the MIT has disciplines the students
 
04:49:48.270 --> 04:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
have to take eight units in the
 
04:49:51.868 --> 04:49:51.878 align:start position:0%
humanities arts and social sciences if
 
04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
sciencists at MIT have to take these
 
04:49:56.110 --> 04:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
courses our students should be able to
 
04:49:58.628 --> 04:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
take them in the public school system
 
04:50:01.070 --> 04:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the time thank
 
04:50:01.080 --> 04:50:01.750 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the time thank
you

representative nice
 
04:50:08.270 --> 04:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
timing uh representative Ryan followed
 
04:50:13.910 --> 04:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you my esteemed colleagues on the
 
04:50:17.868 --> 04:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
committee um I'm changing what I
 
04:50:20.548 --> 04:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
originally wrote because I'm um a little
 
04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
bit incested and I rate okay I am um for
 
04:50:25.390 --> 04:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
full disclosure I am Linda Ryan the
 
04:50:27.390 --> 04:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
state representative from nashal I
 
04:50:29.670 --> 04:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
represent District 4 I'm a retired
 
04:50:33.150 --> 04:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
Middle School teacher um we teach
 
04:50:37.230 --> 04:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
reading writing and math in science
 
04:50:41.350 --> 04:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
class we teach Holocaust in in social
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
studies class we read books that involve
 
04:50:48.910 --> 04:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
those subjects in Reading I'm not sure
 
04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
what people think we taught in Reading
 
04:50:54.110 --> 04:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
if we weren't reading about things that
 
04:50:56.590 --> 04:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
have to do with our government or our
 
04:51:00.150 --> 04:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
country or geography or whatever okay
 
04:51:03.230 --> 04:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
Second Step sorry my original point was
 
04:51:05.150 --> 04:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
do we have a fiscal plan for all the
 
04:51:06.750 --> 04:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
people that we're going to now put out
 
04:51:09.990 --> 04:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
of jobs who own homes in our city in our
 
04:51:13.510 --> 04:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
state who pay taxes because last count
 
04:51:15.788 --> 04:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
that would be half the teachers in my
 
04:51:18.270 --> 04:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
school around the corner from me okay
 
04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
third point and this is very very
 
04:51:24.030 --> 04:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
personal as a no lunch Kid trailer park
 
04:51:27.948 --> 04:51:27.958 align:start position:0%
child okay if I had to only be exposed
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
to Reading Writing and math I would not
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
be standing here before you with a
 
04:51:35.628 --> 04:51:35.638 align:start position:0%
master's degree in education a degree in
 
04:51:38.830 --> 04:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
social work and a science certification
 
04:51:42.030 --> 04:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
from Harvard summer school okay poor
 
04:51:45.830 --> 04:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
kids do not lower your scores we are
 
04:51:47.948 --> 04:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
number five in the country New Hampshire
 
04:51:50.190 --> 04:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
is number five in the country I looked
 
04:51:52.990 --> 04:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
it up again just now all right people
 
04:51:55.030 --> 04:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
who don't do well in reading and writing
 
04:51:59.390 --> 04:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
and math are taken out of classes like
 
04:52:02.430 --> 04:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
art music and homac and sent to
 
04:52:05.310 --> 04:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
additional math and reading classes as
 
04:52:08.830 --> 04:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
good practice is in middle school
 
04:52:11.310 --> 04:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
education right if if if your school
 
04:52:13.390 --> 04:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
district isn't doing that you really
 
04:52:15.030 --> 04:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
need to look at them and what they're
 
04:52:18.150 --> 04:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
doing thank you questions please thank
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
you very much any questions see none
 
04:52:22.948 --> 04:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much next is
 
04:52:27.110 --> 04:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative Reed followed by Mike
 
04:52:29.628 --> 04:52:29.638 align:start position:0%
corkery thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:52:31.190 --> 04:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
honorable members my name is Ellen Reed
 
04:52:32.868 --> 04:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
I represent Rockingham 10 that's new
 
04:52:34.868 --> 04:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
market and new fields for full
 
04:52:36.948 --> 04:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
disclosure I have a bill in before you I
 
04:52:39.708 --> 04:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
believe next week or it's coming up that
 
04:52:41.708 --> 04:52:41.718 align:start position:0%
does almost exactly the opposite I'm
 
04:52:43.750 --> 04:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
expanding specifically Holocaust and
 
04:52:46.030 --> 04:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
genocide studies because I think we need
 
04:52:47.750 --> 04:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
to teach our children things that are
 
04:52:49.830 --> 04:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
important about the world and that's
 
04:52:52.990 --> 04:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
exactly why this is a terrible Bill uh
 
04:52:54.628 --> 04:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to belabor points probably
 
04:52:55.670 --> 04:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
that you've already heard although
 
04:52:58.470 --> 04:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't catch everything um but we
 
04:53:01.190 --> 04:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
know that we have failing education
 
04:53:02.948 --> 04:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
because we're not we know our standards
 
04:53:04.750 --> 04:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
are not up to what the rest of the world
 
04:53:06.230 --> 04:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
is the answer is not to teach our
 
04:53:08.788 --> 04:53:08.798 align:start position:0%
children less we know that the average
 
04:53:10.548 --> 04:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
person can't name the three branches of
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
government or who their Federal
 
04:53:13.788 --> 04:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
delegation are or what the difference
 
04:53:15.788 --> 04:53:15.798 align:start position:0%
between the state house and Congress is
 
04:53:18.510 --> 04:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
we already know that the average person
 
04:53:20.190 --> 04:53:20.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't know the difference between
 
04:53:22.230 --> 04:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
Nazis and Communists who were mortal
 
04:53:23.948 --> 04:53:23.958 align:start position:0%
enemies and stood for exactly the
 
04:53:25.868 --> 04:53:25.878 align:start position:0%
opposite things but most people don't
 
04:53:27.628 --> 04:53:27.638 align:start position:0%
know that we know that our education
 
04:53:29.628 --> 04:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
system is failing the answer is not to
 
04:53:31.590 --> 04:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
teach people
 
04:53:33.948 --> 04:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
less but I think that this has been by
 
04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
Design because if you defund a program a
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
social program to the point that it
 
04:53:41.070 --> 04:53:41.080 align:start position:0%
starts failing
 
04:53:42.948 --> 04:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
then you get to say look that program is
 
04:53:45.230 --> 04:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
failing we can get rid of it it should
 
04:53:47.070 --> 04:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
be privatized and that's exactly what's
 
04:53:47.080 --> 04:53:47.990 align:start position:0%
be privatized and that's exactly what's
been

04:53:47.990 --> 04:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:53:50.590 --> 04:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
happening so the answer is not to teach
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
our children less the answer is to teach
 
04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
our children more and I wanted I wasn't
 
04:53:55.868 --> 04:53:55.878 align:start position:0%
even going to talk on this but I have a
 
04:53:58.150 --> 04:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
very specific story of my own to share I
 
04:53:59.670 --> 04:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
am from South Memphis a very
 
04:54:01.590 --> 04:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
impoverished neighborhood of a large
 
04:54:03.350 --> 04:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
metropolitan area the population of
 
04:54:05.868 --> 04:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
which is larger than this entire
 
04:54:08.990 --> 04:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
State I went across the city I took
 
04:54:10.910 --> 04:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
three public buses to to go across the
 
04:54:13.110 --> 04:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
city because I was a gifted student and
 
04:54:14.788 --> 04:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
I got to go to a public school that was
 
04:54:16.510 --> 04:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
a good Public School it had a
 
04:54:19.788 --> 04:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
planetarium it had an astronomy course
 
04:54:21.990 --> 04:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
it was a blue ribbon presidential school
 
04:54:24.350 --> 04:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
for international studies including
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
languages and I got to go to that school
 
04:54:29.230 --> 04:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
and I had opportunities that I wouldn't
 
04:54:31.590 --> 04:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
have had and I was a I took all I I'll
 
04:54:33.868 --> 04:54:33.878 align:start position:0%
be brief I took all honors in ap's
 
04:54:36.670 --> 04:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
courses but for one year I had to go to
 
04:54:39.548 --> 04:54:39.558 align:start position:0%
my local school in the wrong part of the
 
04:54:42.670 --> 04:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
city and the teaching was so different
 
04:54:44.590 --> 04:54:44.600 align:start position:0%
because they did only teach reading and
 
04:54:46.470 --> 04:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
writing and here's a textbook copy 10
 
04:54:47.948 --> 04:54:47.958 align:start position:0%
pages out of it while they sit there and
 
04:54:50.868 --> 04:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
read a newspaper and my grades went from
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
a to c i was a bright and gifted student
 
04:54:56.670 --> 04:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
and that method of teaching where we
 
04:54:58.190 --> 04:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
teach to pressure and teach to
 
04:55:00.070 --> 04:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
Performance and not teach about the
 
04:55:02.070 --> 04:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
world around us and en encourage that
 
04:55:04.190 --> 04:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
Curiosity about the world around us took
 
04:55:06.548 --> 04:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
me from a straight A student to C but I
 
04:55:08.270 --> 04:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
went back to that wonderful gifted
 
04:55:10.628 --> 04:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
school and I graduated second and in my
 
04:55:12.990 --> 04:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
class and I got a Bachelor's in science
 
04:55:14.628 --> 04:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
in molecular biology from Vanderbilt
 
04:55:16.070 --> 04:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
University with a double minor in
 
04:55:19.030 --> 04:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
religious studies and Japanese I speak
 
04:55:20.510 --> 04:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
Japanese I lived in Japan for three
 
04:55:22.750 --> 04:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
years and I got a master's up here at
 
04:55:26.430 --> 04:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
UNH because of that wonderful expansive
 
04:55:28.750 --> 04:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
well-rounded public school system that I
 
04:55:31.150 --> 04:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
had access to thank you very much thank
 
04:55:33.030 --> 04:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
you there's no questions right we're
 
04:55:34.990 --> 04:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
rolling through all
 
04:55:43.708 --> 04:55:43.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
hi uh my name is Mike corkery and thank
 
04:55:48.070 --> 04:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
you for having me committee um I am from
 
04:55:50.510 --> 04:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
Amer New Hampshire but I am on my 15th
 
04:55:53.430 --> 04:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
year as a public school educator um to
 
04:55:55.310 --> 04:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
be frank on this there's so much that I
 
04:55:57.070 --> 04:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
was thinking of for the last three
 
04:55:58.868 --> 04:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
nights going to bed but a lot of it has
 
04:56:01.150 --> 04:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
already been said so I won't add to that
 
04:56:02.350 --> 04:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
but I do want to add a little bit of
 
04:56:04.750 --> 04:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
like a personal touch to this as a
 
04:56:06.910 --> 04:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
teacher in New Hampshire for the last 14
 
04:56:10.270 --> 04:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
years I've worked in rural towns like uh
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
Armington New Hampshire I've worked in
 
04:56:14.110 --> 04:56:14.120 align:start position:0%
NASA I currently work in Manchester and
 
04:56:16.510 --> 04:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
I worked in Kingston I've seen all kinds
 
04:56:20.030 --> 04:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
of needs so socioeconomic racial all
 
04:56:23.030 --> 04:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing and it has been seen
 
04:56:24.708 --> 04:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
already in other states when we started
 
04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
to see American governments pushing
 
04:56:28.830 --> 04:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
towards the voucher system that um
 
04:56:30.628 --> 04:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
there's actually a book about the south
 
04:56:32.350 --> 04:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
where they say it's a 21st century DM
 
04:56:35.750 --> 04:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
Crow where we are very purposly giving
 
04:56:38.390 --> 04:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
lesser opportunity to certain students
 
04:56:40.270 --> 04:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
because we are primarily funded on the
 
04:56:42.910 --> 04:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
the local level and we don't have those
 
04:56:45.190 --> 04:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
barriers at the federal government not
 
04:56:46.510 --> 04:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
federal I apologize at the state
 
04:56:48.868 --> 04:56:48.878 align:start position:0%
government level so the poorer towns as
 
04:56:51.070 --> 04:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
it's been said before the poorer towns
 
04:56:53.670 --> 04:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
with less tax money coming in are going
 
04:56:55.030 --> 04:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
to be cutting these programs and you
 
04:56:57.110 --> 04:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
will see teachers getting cut with this
 
04:56:59.390 --> 04:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
because with the Need For Less subjects
 
04:57:01.670 --> 04:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
you will see less teachers necessary and
 
04:57:03.910 --> 04:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to pay more taxes than they
 
04:57:06.590 --> 04:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
have to um to just give a a quick
 
04:57:08.390 --> 04:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
analogy that I have no business being
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
such a skinny guy giving but education
 
04:57:13.470 --> 04:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
is like being a weightlifter okay our
 
04:57:14.868 --> 04:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
brain is a
 
04:57:17.110 --> 04:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
muscle right now what we're looking at
 
04:57:18.910 --> 04:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
is only working out our chest we're
 
04:57:20.548 --> 04:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
looking for glamour muscles because
 
04:57:22.110 --> 04:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
that's what our economy is looking like
 
04:57:24.110 --> 04:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
right now but we are making kids devoid
 
04:57:26.670 --> 04:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
of culture and we are dismissing what we
 
04:57:29.030 --> 04:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
have is a United Country we have never
 
04:57:31.030 --> 04:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
been taken over but I go to Poland and
 
04:57:33.190 --> 04:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
they have poets in their cities all of
 
04:57:35.430 --> 04:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
these things Civics um we can't have
 
04:57:37.670 --> 04:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
students that know how to vote already
 
04:57:39.750 --> 04:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
students don't want to come to school I
 
04:57:41.750 --> 04:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
have students either not coming more
 
04:57:43.628 --> 04:57:43.638 align:start position:0%
than a few times in a semester or
 
04:57:45.510 --> 04:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
they're showing up 45 minutes late every
 
04:57:47.868 --> 04:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
day to eliminate the one reason that
 
04:57:49.628 --> 04:57:49.638 align:start position:0%
they come to school every day means that
 
04:57:52.190 --> 04:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
they're not going to come back thank you
 
04:57:55.150 --> 04:57:55.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative SEL
 
04:57:56.548 --> 04:57:56.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um in your
 
04:57:59.868 --> 04:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
experience as a teacher we heard from
 
04:58:01.948 --> 04:58:01.958 align:start position:0%
what something earlier that there's a
 
04:58:04.350 --> 04:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
difference in success rates because of
 
04:58:06.270 --> 04:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
with kids at different socioeconomic
 
04:58:08.830 --> 04:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
levels um would you say the sole cause
 
04:58:10.628 --> 04:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
of that is the school system that
 
04:58:12.390 --> 04:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
they're in or would you say that they're
 
04:58:14.910 --> 04:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
outside Factor I'm sorry could you just
 
04:58:17.390 --> 04:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
say that last part again is the cause of
 
04:58:18.990 --> 04:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
their lack of success the fact that
 
04:58:21.030 --> 04:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
they're in of the school system they're
 
04:58:22.830 --> 04:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
in or is their
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
socioeconomics uh an impact upon their
 
04:58:27.270 --> 04:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
success rates um well it is a
 
04:58:28.830 --> 04:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
combination and they go together I'll
 
04:58:30.190 --> 04:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
try to keep this brief because it's
 
04:58:33.230 --> 04:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
obviously a complicated issue but um you
 
04:58:34.548 --> 04:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
know when you have a student that did
 
04:58:36.670 --> 04:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
not have uh parents or let's just say
 
04:58:38.430 --> 04:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
family members in general that went to
 
04:58:40.750 --> 04:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
college they don't know how to navigate
 
04:58:43.590 --> 04:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
that system the same way I did who uh my
 
04:58:45.310 --> 04:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
father is a pharmacist and went to heavy
 
04:58:46.910 --> 04:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
schooling so when I'm looking to apply
 
04:58:49.150 --> 04:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
for schools the whole time he is pushing
 
04:58:51.910 --> 04:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
me throughout my K12 education um so
 
04:58:54.350 --> 04:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
there's that background but also I can
 
04:58:56.390 --> 04:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
tell you when I worked in Farmington
 
04:58:58.390 --> 04:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
we'd run out of paper when I worked at
 
04:59:00.190 --> 04:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
sa heagan high school for a short time I
 
04:59:02.910 --> 04:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
had 12 different colors I could do it on
 
04:59:04.830 --> 04:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
that's a silly example but this stuff
 
04:59:08.670 --> 04:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
matters we don't have access I I I work
 
04:59:11.430 --> 04:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
for a school that we do high school y we
 
04:59:13.788 --> 04:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
can't pay for tests when funding falls
 
04:59:16.230 --> 04:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
down because of these sorts of things so
 
04:59:18.230 --> 04:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
I think that you can't separate the two
 
04:59:18.240 --> 04:59:19.948 align:start position:0%
I think that you can't separate the two
issues

04:59:19.948 --> 04:59:19.958 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:59:26.548 --> 04:59:26.558 align:start position:0%
unfortunately thank you uh Sarah a
 
04:59:29.670 --> 04:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
AI followed by representative
 
04:59:33.548 --> 04:59:33.558 align:start position:0%
vone uh good afternoon um according to
 
04:59:39.030 --> 04:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:43.150 --> 04:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
card.get United States HB 283 suggests
 
04:59:45.350 --> 04:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
that we should lower that standard by
 
04:59:48.310 --> 04:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
gutting our education requirements never
 
04:59:51.070 --> 04:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
in my lifetime have I witnessed or heard
 
04:59:53.990 --> 04:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
of a government rally behind less
 
04:59:56.270 --> 04:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
education when you examine what this
 
04:59:58.510 --> 04:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
bill is proposing you must question both
 
05:00:00.430 --> 05:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
the motive and the potential
 
05:00:02.788 --> 05:00:02.798 align:start position:0%
consequences without teaching Arts
 
05:00:05.390 --> 05:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
Engineering government languages
 
05:00:08.150 --> 05:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
economics Computer Sciences and most
 
05:00:11.430 --> 05:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
importantly history what is left how can
 
05:00:13.590 --> 05:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
you call schooling without these classes
 
05:00:16.430 --> 05:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
an education at all what you are left
 
05:00:19.070 --> 05:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
with is a less competitive student body
 
05:00:21.470 --> 05:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
that is drastically underprepared for
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
the workforce is that what we want for
 
05:00:24.948 --> 05:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
the Next

Mark Malone representing eeping real
 
05:01:17.990 --> 05:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
quickly um I looked at what this
 
05:01:20.548 --> 05:01:20.558 align:start position:0%
bill would provide for an
 
05:01:23.230 --> 05:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
education once all those requir a little
 
05:01:25.708 --> 05:01:25.718 align:start position:0%
closer to the mic I looked at the bill
 
05:01:28.390 --> 05:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
to to see what
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
requirements uh were left then I looked
 
05:01:35.070 --> 05:01:35.080 align:start position:0%
across the world to find what
 
05:01:38.350 --> 05:01:38.360 align:start position:0%
countries would have the curriculum that
 
05:01:40.430 --> 05:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
would be required by the state of
 
05:01:45.390 --> 05:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
meure one Afghanistan under the
 
05:01:48.430 --> 05:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
Taliban that's what we're talking
 
05:01:50.590 --> 05:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
about there's a question of time I'm
 
05:01:52.868 --> 05:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to look at the national
 
05:01:54.670 --> 05:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
assessment of educational progress the
 
05:01:56.628 --> 05:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
nape scores for New Hampshire guess
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
where New Hampshire
 
05:02:01.350 --> 05:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
is way above the country we're tops we
 
05:02:03.110 --> 05:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
are number one in Reading I forget what
 
05:02:06.270 --> 05:02:06.280 align:start position:0%
grade level now that's a different
 
05:02:08.310 --> 05:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
test and I'm going to ask you to
 
05:02:11.910 --> 05:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
remember the phrase damn lies and
 
05:02:14.070 --> 05:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
statistics in the use of the testing in
 
05:02:16.150 --> 05:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as somebody who had to do
 
05:02:19.948 --> 05:02:19.958 align:start position:0%
test a 20-year principal I know tests
 
05:02:21.270 --> 05:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
and there are good tests and there are
 
05:02:23.310 --> 05:02:23.320 align:start position:0%
bad tests and there are questionable
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
tests and I know that eping Elementary
 
05:02:27.548 --> 05:02:27.558 align:start position:0%
when I was principal for a while under
 
05:02:30.628 --> 05:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
the old um No Child Left Behind that was
 
05:02:32.110 --> 05:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
a really good test a lot of people
 
05:02:34.390 --> 05:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
didn't like it I liked it because it was
 
05:02:37.390 --> 05:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
granular it was deep but guess what it
 
05:02:37.400 --> 05:02:38.470 align:start position:0%
granular it was deep but guess what it
was

05:02:38.470 --> 05:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:02:41.190 --> 05:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
expensive so that test was replaced by a
 
05:02:43.310 --> 05:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
cheaper test which I think is probably
 
05:02:44.830 --> 05:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
the same one today because I retired if
 
05:02:46.510 --> 05:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
we could stick to the bill and the
 
05:02:49.788 --> 05:02:49.798 align:start position:0%
subject matter so the subject is the the
 
05:02:52.990 --> 05:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
author of the bill referenced low test
 
05:02:55.110 --> 05:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
scores a number of times I am
 
05:02:58.310 --> 05:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
questioning whether that's a valid point
 
05:03:00.590 --> 05:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
and whether that's just a just a quick
 
05:03:02.548 --> 05:03:02.558 align:start position:0%
way to get to my other point there's
 
05:03:04.868 --> 05:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
time and then there's money once you
 
05:03:07.750 --> 05:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
take out nearly 50% of the
 
05:03:11.190 --> 05:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
requirements it isn't too big a leap
 
05:03:13.708 --> 05:03:13.718 align:start position:0%
when we've had arguments and believe me
 
05:03:15.150 --> 05:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
from the other side of the aisle there
 
05:03:18.390 --> 05:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
are lots of people trying to cut the
 
05:03:21.510 --> 05:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding not raise it cut it
 
05:03:23.990 --> 05:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's a logical extension to say if you
 
05:03:24.000 --> 05:03:25.030 align:start position:0%
it's a logical extension to say if you
don't

05:03:25.030 --> 05:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:03:28.070 --> 05:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
need 50% of the curriculum then why
 
05:03:30.230 --> 05:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
should the adequacy number be this High
 
05:03:32.390 --> 05:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
it should be this high if you could wrap
 
05:03:36.788 --> 05:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:41.628 --> 05:03:41.638 align:start position:0%

trillion dollars says to me financial
 
05:07:33.470 --> 05:07:33.480 align:start position:0%

05:07:35.230 --> 05:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
of these young children's Minds teaching

committee my name is Heather robai and
 
05:09:19.788 --> 05:09:19.798 align:start position:0%
I'm from marac I'm here today as a
 
05:09:21.948 --> 05:09:21.958 align:start position:0%
parent to voice my strong opposition to
 
05:09:25.110 --> 05:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill 283 marac School District
 
05:09:27.110 --> 05:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
created a vision of a graduate that I'd
 
05:09:28.750 --> 05:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
like to share with you that highlights
 
05:09:30.510 --> 05:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
the skills and attributes marac high
 
05:09:32.310 --> 05:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
school graduates should possess to
 
05:09:34.270 --> 05:09:34.280 align:start position:0%
become positive community members who
 
05:09:36.590 --> 05:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
are future ready whether that future be
 
05:09:38.910 --> 05:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
a career in the trades college education
 
05:09:42.030 --> 05:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
or in our military our graduates will be
 
05:09:43.788 --> 05:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
effective and critical thinkers who
 
05:09:45.830 --> 05:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
contribute positively in their local and
 
05:09:47.910 --> 05:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
Global communities their public
 
05:09:50.470 --> 05:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
education prepares them for this future
 
05:09:51.708 --> 05:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
by developing their executive
 
05:09:54.030 --> 05:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
functioning skills financial and dig
 
05:09:56.310 --> 05:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
digital literacy and communication
 
05:09:57.948 --> 05:09:57.958 align:start position:0%
skills in the areas of listening
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
speaking and writing these are the
 
05:10:02.510 --> 05:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
attributes that I hope that my daughter
 
05:10:05.030 --> 05:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
and all New Hampshire's children receive
 
05:10:06.628 --> 05:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
through their Public School
 
05:10:09.470 --> 05:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
educations this bill proposes to remove
 
05:10:10.830 --> 05:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
many of the topics that have been
 
05:10:12.990 --> 05:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
discussed and without these New
 
05:10:15.270 --> 05:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's definition of an adequate
 
05:10:18.150 --> 05:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
education will no longer truly be
 
05:10:20.708 --> 05:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
adequate choices have consequences and
 
05:10:22.750 --> 05:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
by removing these areas it sets the
 
05:10:24.230 --> 05:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
stage for these subjects to be
 
05:10:26.430 --> 05:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
eliminated by school districts as their
 
05:10:28.868 --> 05:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
budgets are slashed because property tax
 
05:10:30.910 --> 05:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
owners can no longer bear the burden of
 
05:10:32.548 --> 05:10:32.558 align:start position:0%
Education costs which have been
 
05:10:35.390 --> 05:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
downshifted onto them by the state as
 
05:10:37.390 --> 05:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
public schools are forced to cut what's
 
05:10:41.708 --> 05:10:41.718 align:start position:0%
extra these areas will be cut if private
 
05:10:43.548 --> 05:10:43.558 align:start position:0%
schools are the only ones left who can
 
05:10:46.110 --> 05:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
afford to offer Arts technology history
 
05:10:48.510 --> 05:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
and these other areas we're creating a
 
05:10:50.470 --> 05:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
disparity between families that can
 
05:10:52.270 --> 05:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
afford private schools and those that
 
05:10:55.030 --> 05:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
cannot as things like efas continue to
 
05:10:56.628 --> 05:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
eat away at New Hampshire's education
 
05:10:59.310 --> 05:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
trust fund this bill continues to erode
 
05:11:01.190 --> 05:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
public education in New Hampshire
 
05:11:03.470 --> 05:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
setting our children up for failure as
 
05:11:05.270 --> 05:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
they enter the world without the skills
 
05:11:07.030 --> 05:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
and knowledge they need to achieve their
 
05:11:09.350 --> 05:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
Highest Potential by removing these
 
05:11:11.510 --> 05:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
requirements the state fails to provide
 
05:11:13.230 --> 05:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's children with the
 
05:11:15.470 --> 05:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
well-rounded adequate education they
 
05:11:17.788 --> 05:11:17.798 align:start position:0%
deserve so I urge you to oppose House
 
05:11:20.390 --> 05:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 283 and work to support public
 
05:11:22.510 --> 05:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
education so children like the ones who
 
05:11:24.708 --> 05:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
spoke so eloquently today in favor of
 
05:11:27.230 --> 05:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill n can continue to grow and
 
05:11:28.868 --> 05:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
learn here in New Hampshire and have
 
05:11:31.030 --> 05:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
bright successful Futures thank thank
 
05:11:32.030 --> 05:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
you very
 
05:11:35.390 --> 05:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
much see no further questions thank you
 
05:11:42.948 --> 05:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:47.230 --> 05:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
Walker yeah way down here thank you yes
 
05:11:50.310 --> 05:11:50.320 align:start position:0%

05:11:52.670 --> 05:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
education policy committee members thank
 
05:11:54.430 --> 05:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking the time to listen to My
 
05:11:56.628 --> 05:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
Testimony today my name is Caitlyn
 
05:12:00.030 --> 05:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
Bernier and I live in marac and I am on
 
05:12:02.750 --> 05:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
the School District budget committee but
 
05:12:05.270 --> 05:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
I here today representing myself as a
 
05:12:09.470 --> 05:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
parent in opposition of HB 283 this Bill
 
05:12:12.190 --> 05:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
opens the door to start defunding public
 
05:12:14.868 --> 05:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
education and is not reflective of what
 
05:12:17.868 --> 05:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
the majority of your citizens believe
 
05:12:20.670 --> 05:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
extreme political agendas have no place
 
05:12:23.628 --> 05:12:23.638 align:start position:0%
in our New Hampshire Public Schools HB
 
05:12:26.590 --> 05:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
283 was introduced only 5 days before
 
05:12:28.110 --> 05:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
the public hearing because
 
05:12:29.788 --> 05:12:29.798 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire knew that the
 
05:12:32.310 --> 05:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
majority of constituents in every town
 
05:12:34.670 --> 05:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
and city in New Hampshire would be in up
 
05:12:36.788 --> 05:12:36.798 align:start position:0%
in arms with the absurdity this bill
 
05:12:40.030 --> 05:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
includes as of Sunday at 6: p.m. only
 
05:12:44.190 --> 05:12:44.200 align:start position:0%
almost 26,000 taxpaying members of your
 
05:12:46.708 --> 05:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
communities have voted in opposition of
 
05:12:50.430 --> 05:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
HB 283 this bill is an obvious attempt
 
05:12:52.430 --> 05:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
at decreasing the state's Financial
 
05:12:54.868 --> 05:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
Obligations to provide an adequate
 
05:12:57.750 --> 05:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
public education and we see you this
 
05:13:00.830 --> 05:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
bill if it were passed would see an
 
05:13:03.150 --> 05:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
increase in Charter and private schools
 
05:13:05.230 --> 05:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
by lowering the requirements necessary
 
05:13:07.750 --> 05:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
to provide an adequate education which
 
05:13:10.150 --> 05:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
takes more funds from our most
 
05:13:12.990 --> 05:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
vulnerable population it doesn't take
 
05:13:15.310 --> 05:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
much to connect this to all the bills in
 
05:13:17.230 --> 05:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
the house currently that give more power
 
05:13:19.430 --> 05:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
to local school boards allow private
 
05:13:22.230 --> 05:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
schools to receive efas and the income
 
05:13:25.070 --> 05:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
limit removal for said efas that takes
 
05:13:27.270 --> 05:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
taxpaying dollars away from our Public
 
05:13:29.750 --> 05:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
Schools this is a purposeful and
 
05:13:32.430 --> 05:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
calculated agenda meant to hurt those of
 
05:13:34.788 --> 05:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
us that believe in public education by
 
05:13:37.868 --> 05:13:37.878 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor I came here to testify
 
05:13:41.470 --> 05:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
an opposition of H b283 and this extreme
 
05:13:43.910 --> 05:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
extreme political agenda and wanted to
 
05:13:45.788 --> 05:13:45.798 align:start position:0%
express to the representatives who vote
 
05:13:48.310 --> 05:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
in favor of this that you do not speak
 
05:13:50.708 --> 05:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
for the majority of your constituents
 
05:13:52.750 --> 05:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
and that we are paying attention this
 
05:13:54.670 --> 05:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
isn't an attempt to focus on core
 
05:13:56.628 --> 05:13:56.638 align:start position:0%
academics like the prime sponsor said
 
05:14:00.350 --> 05:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
today this is a specific elimination of
 
05:14:02.150 --> 05:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum that doesn't fit his narrow
 
05:14:04.390 --> 05:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
views I thank the committee members for
 
05:14:06.030 --> 05:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
listening and hope you are reading the
 
05:14:08.390 --> 05:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
room today and see that this bill does
 
05:14:10.350 --> 05:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
not reflect New Hampshire's definition
 
05:14:14.030 --> 05:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
of an equal and adequate education any
 
05:14:17.390 --> 05:14:17.400 align:start position:0%

world second point this will absolutely
 
05:15:06.350 --> 05:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
widen the opportunity Gap representative

05:15:10.350 --> 05:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
in the core subjects math and English
 
05:15:13.948 --> 05:15:13.958 align:start position:0%
can take other classes like art Etc and
 
05:15:15.510 --> 05:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
kids who don't do well just get math and
 
05:15:18.150 --> 05:15:18.160 align:start position:0%

art she loves chorus and she has gained
 
05:15:28.310 --> 05:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
so much self-confidence being a part of

05:16:35.628 --> 05:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
this um effort as also negatively
 
05:16:37.590 --> 05:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
impacting Workforce Development and
 
05:16:40.310 --> 05:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
commerce uh areas around agriculture
 
05:16:43.470 --> 05:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
through stem Medical Science and and the
 
05:16:46.230 --> 05:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
Performing Arts absolutely uh you know I
 
05:16:48.150 --> 05:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
I was here for the the B first bill of
 
05:16:49.990 --> 05:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
the day where the students uh spoke
 
05:16:53.510 --> 05:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
about the power and necessity of all of
 
05:16:56.628 --> 05:16:56.638 align:start position:0%
the components of stem um and having the
 
05:16:59.548 --> 05:16:59.558 align:start position:0%
exposure in our Public Schools as also I
 
05:17:01.788 --> 05:17:01.798 align:start position:0%

05:17:16.470 --> 05:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
would you predict would happen to
 
05:17:18.670 --> 05:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
youngsters who come to school that don't
 
05:17:20.948 --> 05:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
have any interest in math or science you
 
05:17:22.270 --> 05:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
think that may impact
 
05:17:22.280 --> 05:17:23.990 align:start position:0%
think that may impact
enrollment

05:17:23.990 --> 05:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
05:17:26.390 --> 05:17:26.400 align:start position:0%

my question um speaking from a district
 
05:17:33.628 --> 05:17:33.638 align:start position:0%
across the state would it surprise you
 
05:17:35.110 --> 05:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
that our high school one of the most
 
05:17:36.708 --> 05:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
sought-after and difficult courses to
 
05:17:40.310 --> 05:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
get into is bake shop and um do you see
 
05:17:42.030 --> 05:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
the a class such as bake shop covering
 
05:17:43.788 --> 05:17:43.798 align:start position:0%
some of those other Essentials while not
 
05:17:46.190 --> 05:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily being specifically a reading
 
05:17:49.230 --> 05:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
or math class 100% when I was an art
 
05:17:51.868 --> 05:17:51.878 align:start position:0%
teacher uh I made it a point to ensure
 
05:17:53.910 --> 05:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
that art I was representing art as it
 
05:17:56.230 --> 05:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
was represented across disciplines I
 
05:17:58.110 --> 05:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
would go into math classes and integrate
 
05:18:00.070 --> 05:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
art through the use of tessellations uh
 
05:18:02.390 --> 05:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know echoing mcer I'd go into
 
05:18:04.110 --> 05:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
history classes uh that we're learning
 
05:18:05.708 --> 05:18:05.718 align:start position:0%
about the Renaissance and talk about
 
05:18:07.990 --> 05:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
artists of the Renaissance and the the
 
05:18:09.628 --> 05:18:09.638 align:start position:0%
um advances that were being made during
 
05:18:13.310 --> 05:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
that time so sure in in lots of other
 
05:18:16.070 --> 05:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
classes the Arts they Crosscut each
 
05:18:20.708 --> 05:18:20.718 align:start position:0%
other absolutely thank you uh next is
 
05:18:31.868 --> 05:18:31.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:34.670 --> 05:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
ler it is the policy of the State of New
 
05:18:36.510 --> 05:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that public elementary and
 
05:18:38.788 --> 05:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
secondary education shall provide all

prepare them for successful
 
05:18:46.910 --> 05:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
participation in the social economic
 
05:18:48.948 --> 05:18:48.958 align:start position:0%
scientific technological and political
 
05:18:51.670 --> 05:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
systems of a free government now and in
 
05:18:53.670 --> 05:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
the years to come this is a quote taken
 
05:18:56.230 --> 05:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
directly from statute 193 section E1 of
 
05:18:58.390 --> 05:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
our state's law this sentence written in
 
05:19:01.350 --> 05:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
1998 defines the goals and purposes of
 
05:19:01.360 --> 05:19:02.430 align:start position:0%
1998 defines the goals and purposes of
the

05:19:02.430 --> 05:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:19:04.670 --> 05:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
statute ladies and gentlemen my name is
 
05:19:06.270 --> 05:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
Nicole trch montin a New Hampshire
 
05:19:08.230 --> 05:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
constituent and a member of the 2020
 
05:19:09.590 --> 05:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
class of the the Bedford public high
 
05:19:12.310 --> 05:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
school I will start with a question how
 
05:19:14.510 --> 05:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
will any of the changes proposed in HB
 
05:19:16.990 --> 05:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
283 further the clearly stated purpose
 
05:19:19.868 --> 05:19:19.878 align:start position:0%
of this legislation how can a public Not
 
05:19:21.830 --> 05:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
educated in the basics of Economics or
 
05:19:24.150 --> 05:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
Civics participate in a free democratic
 
05:19:25.910 --> 05:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
government that demands its people to
 
05:19:28.750 --> 05:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
make decisions on these topics I
 
05:19:29.830 --> 05:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
understand that New Hampshire public
 
05:19:32.270 --> 05:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
education is reliant on our taxpayers as
 
05:19:34.590 --> 05:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
a taxpayer is the education of our youth
 
05:19:36.548 --> 05:19:36.558 align:start position:0%
no longer worth the our money in the
 
05:19:39.190 --> 05:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
eyes of our state officials I am calling
 
05:19:40.990 --> 05:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
for you our representatives to think of
 
05:19:43.230 --> 05:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
the children the children of New
 
05:19:44.788 --> 05:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who are attending or will
 
05:19:47.548 --> 05:19:47.558 align:start position:0%
attend public elementary high middle or
 
05:19:48.910 --> 05:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
High School are citizens of New
 
05:19:50.708 --> 05:19:50.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and therefore the
 
05:19:53.310 --> 05:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility of our state government
 
05:19:55.070 --> 05:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
they are a group of people who solely
 
05:19:57.548 --> 05:19:57.558 align:start position:0%
rely on representatives to represent
 
05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
their needs and to pass legislation for
 
05:20:02.310 --> 05:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
their benefit this Committee in the
 
05:20:03.868 --> 05:20:03.878 align:start position:0%
house as a whole therefore have a great
 
05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility towards New Hampshire's
 
05:20:07.150 --> 05:20:07.160 align:start position:0%
children do the proposed amendments to
 
05:20:10.230 --> 05:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
RSA 193e truly benefit this state's
 
05:20:12.230 --> 05:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
youth I understand the proposed
 
05:20:14.030 --> 05:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
amendment does not insist schools must
 
05:20:15.750 --> 05:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
change their curriculum but that New
 
05:20:17.390 --> 05:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will no longer Aid schools in
 
05:20:19.150 --> 05:20:19.160 align:start position:0%
teaching the topics of History
 
05:20:20.670 --> 05:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
government languages and personal
 
05:20:23.150 --> 05:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
finance among others I am sure you are
 
05:20:25.110 --> 05:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
aware of the following implications
 
05:20:26.830 --> 05:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
schools that rely on government Aid to
 
05:20:28.670 --> 05:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
teach their students these topics will
 
05:20:29.830 --> 05:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
have to make changes to their
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
curriculums to reflect their new budgets
 
05:20:33.788 --> 05:20:33.798 align:start position:0%
this will infect impoverished areas most
 
05:20:36.670 --> 05:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
heavily to State the obvious no one who
 
05:20:38.150 --> 05:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
works in our government on the state or
 
05:20:39.910 --> 05:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
federal level level is Immortal
 
05:20:41.670 --> 05:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
eventually children who experience these
 
05:20:42.910 --> 05:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
changes in policy will grow up and
 
05:20:44.670 --> 05:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
become members of our government how
 
05:20:46.030 --> 05:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
will our government look if only
 
05:20:47.708 --> 05:20:47.718 align:start position:0%
children who have grown up in affluent
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
areas have the necessary education
 
05:20:51.230 --> 05:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
understanding to take up public office
 
05:20:52.548 --> 05:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
how will our government look without
 
05:20:54.390 --> 05:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
representation from protected groups
 
05:20:55.708 --> 05:20:55.718 align:start position:0%
minorities are the most likely to live
 
05:20:57.590 --> 05:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
in impoverished areas and how will the
 
05:20:59.110 --> 05:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
government look when Representatives who
 
05:21:00.948 --> 05:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
were never even shown the constitution
 
05:21:03.270 --> 05:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
in school take up office could you wrap
 
05:21:05.470 --> 05:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
up please I urge this committee to ask
 
05:21:06.510 --> 05:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
themselves the following question when
 
05:21:08.070 --> 05:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
debating the merits of this bill ask
 
05:21:10.510 --> 05:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
yourselves how does New Hampshire house
 
05:21:12.590 --> 05:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
bill 283 prepare students for
 
05:21:14.708 --> 05:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
participation in a free government I
 
05:21:16.270 --> 05:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
would argue that it does not if an
 
05:21:18.070 --> 05:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
amendment is clearly disadvantageous to
 
05:21:19.868 --> 05:21:19.878 align:start position:0%
a select group of people and opposes the
 
05:21:21.548 --> 05:21:21.558 align:start position:0%
very ideals and purpose of a New
 
05:21:23.548 --> 05:21:23.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute how can it be put into
 
05:21:26.310 --> 05:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
law thank you for your time thank
 
05:21:34.110 --> 05:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:36.310 --> 05:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
sinat chairman and members of the
 
05:21:37.548 --> 05:21:37.558 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much for
 
05:21:39.110 --> 05:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
letting me speak
 
05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
um and my purpose in speaking to you
 
05:21:42.270 --> 05:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
today is not to point out the many
 
05:21:44.110 --> 05:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
benefits of an education that includes
 
05:21:46.628 --> 05:21:46.638 align:start position:0%
the subjects that there seek this bill
 
05:21:48.670 --> 05:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
seeks to eliminate because the people
 
05:21:51.030 --> 05:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
before me did a much better job of that
 
05:21:54.350 --> 05:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
but what occurred to me was a glaring
 
05:21:58.150 --> 05:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
inconsistency between what this bill is
 
05:22:01.708 --> 05:22:01.718 align:start position:0%
proposing and um what I see going on
 
05:22:04.590 --> 05:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
with the education funding in New
 
05:22:08.510 --> 05:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I was reviewing um some
 
05:22:10.430 --> 05:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
some of the expenses listed in the New
 
05:22:12.910 --> 05:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children's scholarship uh
 
05:22:17.470 --> 05:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
website for the uh fiscal year 2022 to
 
05:22:20.548 --> 05:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
23 and I was amazed that there are
 
05:22:22.590 --> 05:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of dollars in
 
05:22:25.910 --> 05:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
expenditures for items teaching the
 
05:22:28.270 --> 05:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
subject areas of art Music World
 
05:22:30.868 --> 05:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
Language computer science engineering
 
05:22:35.590 --> 05:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
and technology and World languages so um
 
05:22:37.510 --> 05:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
at the same time we're trying to take
 
05:22:40.350 --> 05:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
these subjects of the public schools
 
05:22:44.670 --> 05:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
where um resources are used on an
 
05:22:48.430 --> 05:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
economy of scale for the many the 85% of
 
05:22:50.788 --> 05:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
the children that are in public schools
 
05:22:53.670 --> 05:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
we are handing out thousands and
 
05:22:57.070 --> 05:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to individuals to
 
05:23:00.150 --> 05:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
learn on their own these very same
 
05:23:04.990 --> 05:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
subject areas so um in summary I know
 
05:23:07.030 --> 05:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
the intention is probably at the bottom
 
05:23:09.948 --> 05:23:09.958 align:start position:0%
of this to make the conal lawsuit a moot
 
05:23:12.470 --> 05:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
point by changing the composition of an
 
05:23:12.480 --> 05:23:13.470 align:start position:0%
point by changing the composition of an
adequate

05:23:13.470 --> 05:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
05:23:16.548 --> 05:23:16.558 align:start position:0%
education but there is a glaring
 
05:23:19.230 --> 05:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in the current education
 
05:23:22.150 --> 05:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
philosophy and agenda in New Hampshire
 
05:23:25.070 --> 05:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
that shrinks public resources used for
 
05:23:28.628 --> 05:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
the many to scatter them for the few and
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the process decimating the education
 
05:23:34.868 --> 05:23:34.878 align:start position:0%
for the many thank you thank you for
 
05:23:34.878 --> 05:23:36.270 align:start position:0%
for the many thank you thank you for
your

05:23:36.270 --> 05:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:23:41.430 --> 05:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
testimony uh next is uh

Pam is she
 
05:23:47.628 --> 05:23:47.638 align:start position:0%
here uh not seeing her uh how about
 
05:23:59.310 --> 05:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:02.470 --> 05:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
held thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:24:04.788 --> 05:24:04.798 align:start position:0%

committee um I'm Bishop Rob herfeld I'm
 
05:24:09.990 --> 05:24:10.000 align:start position:0%

New
 
05:24:13.788 --> 05:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my job is to travel all over
 
05:24:16.430 --> 05:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
the place in New Hampshire and I
 
05:24:19.390 --> 05:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
visit uh roughly 50 churches from C
 
05:24:23.030 --> 05:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
Brook to Salem Kean to Portsmith North
 
05:24:25.708 --> 05:24:25.718 align:start position:0%
Conway everything in between and I see a
 
05:24:28.628 --> 05:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
lot of kids I'm also on the board of a
 
05:24:31.110 --> 05:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
couple of a couple Independent Schools
 
05:24:32.708 --> 05:24:32.718 align:start position:0%
that were founded by the Episcopal
 
05:24:34.430 --> 05:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
church and I can speak to although I
 
05:24:39.150 --> 05:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't planning to about that wide
 
05:24:44.590 --> 05:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
obscene opportunity Gap um but that
 
05:24:45.868 --> 05:24:45.878 align:start position:0%
wasn't why I came I just it was
 
05:24:48.548 --> 05:24:48.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned I I wish to speak against this
 
05:24:51.868 --> 05:24:51.878 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm not going to ascribe intent
 
05:24:55.430 --> 05:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
I want to honor the pure intent of the
 
05:24:58.350 --> 05:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor but I wish to begin with a short
 
05:25:00.910 --> 05:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
but luminous
 
05:25:03.070 --> 05:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
list Allan

Daniels Justice David sudor
 
05:25:12.030 --> 05:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
and our current governor Kelly aot are
 
05:25:16.030 --> 05:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
just few of the exemplary contributors
 
05:25:19.150 --> 05:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
to our world they are explorers civil
 
05:25:22.868 --> 05:25:22.878 align:start position:0%
suit civil servants jurists thinkers
 
05:25:25.868 --> 05:25:25.878 align:start position:0%
each products of the public school

05:25:31.830 --> 05:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it was a system that was
 
05:25:33.948 --> 05:25:33.958 align:start position:0%
committed to their intellectual and
 
05:25:36.230 --> 05:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
personal growth and
 
05:25:38.708 --> 05:25:38.718 align:start position:0%
development the value of which has
 
05:25:41.430 --> 05:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
accured not only to New Hampshire but to
 
05:25:41.440 --> 05:25:43.030 align:start position:0%
accured not only to New Hampshire but to
the

05:25:43.030 --> 05:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:25:46.868 --> 05:25:46.878 align:start position:0%
world I suspect that the schools that
 
05:25:50.190 --> 05:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
they attended nasua
 
05:25:50.200 --> 05:25:52.230 align:start position:0%
they attended nasua
conquered

05:25:52.230 --> 05:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
conquered
 
05:25:52.240 --> 05:25:54.350 align:start position:0%
conquered
um

05:25:54.350 --> 05:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:59.270 --> 05:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
Keen included Math Science History
 
05:26:06.430 --> 05:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:08.990 --> 05:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
already I'm curious
 
05:26:13.750 --> 05:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
if this bill essentially says adequacy
 
05:26:16.708 --> 05:26:16.718 align:start position:0%
we haven't done adequacy let's admit our
 
05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
failure let's surrender and claim
 
05:26:21.548 --> 05:26:21.558 align:start position:0%
victory that doesn't work in foreign
 
05:26:24.190 --> 05:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
policy it shouldn't work with our kids
 
05:26:26.190 --> 05:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very
 
05:26:28.830 --> 05:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
much uh Lisa
 
05:26:33.350 --> 05:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
Gibson followed by Robert
 
05:26:36.990 --> 05:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
Lawless hi my name is Lisa Gibson and um
 
05:26:38.590 --> 05:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
I'm from Rochester New Hampshire sure I
 
05:26:41.590 --> 05:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
moved here from Tampa Florida and I can
 
05:26:44.190 --> 05:26:44.200 align:start position:0%
say that kind of from experience raising
 
05:26:46.230 --> 05:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
a child in the school system in Florida
 
05:26:48.470 --> 05:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
that cutting funding or diverting it to
 
05:26:50.750 --> 05:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
different locations and taking away Arts
 
05:26:54.670 --> 05:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
education is ridiculous for one many
 
05:26:56.510 --> 05:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
many reasons but the other thing I have
 
05:26:58.708 --> 05:26:58.718 align:start position:0%
to say is I'm the operations manager for
 
05:27:01.590 --> 05:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
Rochester performance and arts center
 
05:27:05.270 --> 05:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
and I see a plethora of students that
 
05:27:08.270 --> 05:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
need art they need language they need
 
05:27:12.350 --> 05:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
need a connection to learning and we
 
05:27:15.190 --> 05:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
don't say come do art and play in the
 
05:27:16.830 --> 05:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
theater and don't ever read a book don't
 
05:27:21.310 --> 05:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
do math um our systems our sound systems
 
05:27:24.350 --> 05:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
our St set design stage design lighting
 
05:27:28.910 --> 05:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
all require math reading science all of
 
05:27:30.510 --> 05:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
those things are necessary things the
 
05:27:31.788 --> 05:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
other thing I'll say is the Arts
 
05:27:35.110 --> 05:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
industry in New Hampshire sorry I'm
 
05:27:39.830 --> 05:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
blind um 96 million dollars to the
 
05:27:43.310 --> 05:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
economy in just New Hampshire the Arts
 
05:27:43.320 --> 05:27:45.868 align:start position:0%
economy in just New Hampshire the Arts
industry

05:27:45.868 --> 05:27:45.878 align:start position:0%
industry
 
05:27:48.670 --> 05:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
um three million of person or three
 
05:27:51.750 --> 05:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
million in tax dollars to the New
 
05:27:53.830 --> 05:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire government because of the Arts
 
05:27:55.510 --> 05:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
and that's not just Performing Arts but
 
05:27:57.110 --> 05:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's Visual Arts that's Arts across
 
05:28:00.390 --> 05:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
the board um and another thing is I I
 
05:28:02.708 --> 05:28:02.718 align:start position:0%
have two children or I four children two
 
05:28:05.430 --> 05:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
of them are severe special needs and our
 
05:28:08.708 --> 05:28:08.718 align:start position:0%
problem is not what we're
 
05:28:11.310 --> 05:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
teaching in schools our problem is
 
05:28:14.230 --> 05:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
teaching to standardize testing my
 
05:28:16.830 --> 05:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
children continue to be pressed forward
 
05:28:18.948 --> 05:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
to the next grade level even though they
 
05:28:20.670 --> 05:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
don't have the building blocks to move
 
05:28:23.470 --> 05:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
on that has nothing to do with history
 
05:28:26.430 --> 05:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
or art or robotics or engineering that
 
05:28:29.628 --> 05:28:29.638 align:start position:0%
has to do with teaching to testing
 
05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
teachers are pulling their hair out to
 
05:28:34.590 --> 05:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
see eye to eye with these children and
 
05:28:36.628 --> 05:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
find a way to spark interest so they
 
05:28:38.708 --> 05:28:38.718 align:start position:0%
they'll pick up that book so they'll do
 
05:28:41.110 --> 05:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
that math Pro math problem but they're
 
05:28:42.788 --> 05:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
not going to do it if you take every bit
 
05:28:45.910 --> 05:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
of joy and light out of their school day
 
05:28:48.830 --> 05:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say thank you oh
 
05:28:51.030 --> 05:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative selig
 
05:28:52.788 --> 05:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
thank you and I just I didn't quite hear
 
05:28:54.350 --> 05:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
the name of the organization that you
 
05:28:55.750 --> 05:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
work for and so I was hoping you could
 
05:28:58.110 --> 05:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
say it a little more slowly sure I work
 
05:29:00.750 --> 05:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
for Rochester opera house but I am the
 
05:29:02.788 --> 05:29:02.798 align:start position:0%
operations manager for Rochester
 
05:29:04.548 --> 05:29:04.558 align:start position:0%
performance and arts center which is our
 
05:29:08.470 --> 05:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
education piece which we offer that educ
 
05:29:10.628 --> 05:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
also to homeschoolers and all of that
 
05:29:12.390 --> 05:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
stuff but the children that come from
 
05:29:15.310 --> 05:29:15.320 align:start position:0%
our elementary schoolers schools and our
 
05:29:17.310 --> 05:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
high schools and middle schools are
 
05:29:19.548 --> 05:29:19.558 align:start position:0%
learning they're doing math they're
 
05:29:22.150 --> 05:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
doing visual art as well as performance
 
05:29:25.190 --> 05:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
art we don't we we don't tend to
 
05:29:27.708 --> 05:29:27.718 align:start position:0%
minimize those subjects but we are
 
05:29:29.910 --> 05:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
allowing children to find something that
 
05:29:31.910 --> 05:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
will spark in them so they will pick up
 
05:29:35.190 --> 05:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
those books thank you thank

05:29:47.390 --> 05:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee for hearing Our
 
05:29:49.628 --> 05:29:49.638 align:start position:0%
Testimony um a number of the speakers
 
05:29:52.270 --> 05:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
have spoken much more eloquently than I
 
05:29:54.788 --> 05:29:54.798 align:start position:0%
can about the specifics uh so I think
 
05:29:57.390 --> 05:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
I'll just stick with the fact that uh
 
05:29:59.350 --> 05:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
I'm probably representing a lot of other
 
05:30:02.230 --> 05:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
folks in expressing outrage that we even
 
05:30:05.350 --> 05:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
have to be here to oppose this bill it's
 
05:30:09.350 --> 05:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
ridiculous um that we're here trying to
 
05:30:11.430 --> 05:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
keep things all of the things listed
 
05:30:14.750 --> 05:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
here uh in our schools uh my parents
 
05:30:18.230 --> 05:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
were both uh uh teachers my dad ended
 
05:30:20.548 --> 05:30:20.558 align:start position:0%
his career uh as a principal down in
 
05:30:22.590 --> 05:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I spent a lot of time
 
05:30:24.990 --> 05:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
talking about education um while I was
 
05:30:27.390 --> 05:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
being educated I have a master's degree
 
05:30:31.670 --> 05:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh I'm a US Army um active duty veteran
 
05:30:35.510 --> 05:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
and my education was probably the thing
 
05:30:38.750 --> 05:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
that uh I can point to
 
05:30:40.750 --> 05:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
and the diversity of that education in
 
05:30:43.470 --> 05:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
being successful
 
05:30:45.350 --> 05:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:30:47.628 --> 05:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
think a number of folks have already
 
05:30:49.788 --> 05:30:49.798 align:start position:0%
spoken about the way we fund things here
 
05:30:54.230 --> 05:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
instead of having to defend common sense
 
05:30:57.270 --> 05:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
um against ideas like this maybe the
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
representatives should think about
 
05:31:00.948 --> 05:31:00.958 align:start position:0%
publicly about about how they're funding
 
05:31:02.910 --> 05:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
public schools and talk with their other
 
05:31:04.590 --> 05:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
representatives and actually do some
 
05:31:06.510 --> 05:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
work that means something this is
 
05:31:08.510 --> 05:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
ridiculous I have nothing more to say
 
05:31:12.150 --> 05:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
about it thank you thank
 
05:31:17.190 --> 05:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr Meyer followed by Kathleen
 
05:31:19.470 --> 05:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
Slover thank you chairman cordelli and
 
05:31:22.670 --> 05:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
representatives I'm Jim Moyer a resident
 
05:31:25.390 --> 05:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
of Epsom New Hampshire and I oppose HB
 
05:31:29.310 --> 05:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
283 joining over 25,000 citizens who
 
05:31:31.990 --> 05:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
submitted opposition on the website the
 
05:31:34.070 --> 05:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
bill is sponsored by my epim
 
05:31:36.230 --> 05:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative Dan Maguire but I don't
 
05:31:38.750 --> 05:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
think it represents the sentiment my
 
05:31:41.390 --> 05:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
neighbors last week in Epsom we had a
 
05:31:43.670 --> 05:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
doozy of a town meeting where petition
 
05:31:45.430 --> 05:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
was brought in front of us that would
 
05:31:47.670 --> 05:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
take away the school board's Authority
 
05:31:50.830 --> 05:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
and instead put in a cap on spending on
 
05:31:54.030 --> 05:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
education by an overwhelming vote this
 
05:31:55.750 --> 05:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
petition was rendered harmless by an
 
05:31:57.390 --> 05:31:57.400 align:start position:0%
amendment of The
 
05:32:00.708 --> 05:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
People two facts were made clear to me
 
05:32:03.150 --> 05:32:03.160 align:start position:0%
from the discussion on this petition one
 
05:32:05.590 --> 05:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
property taxes are too high and many
 
05:32:07.990 --> 05:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
residents are burdened
 
05:32:10.470 --> 05:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
and so much as the fear losing their
 
05:32:13.070 --> 05:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
homes in that regard this
 
05:32:16.310 --> 05:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
proposal uh by uh representative Maguire
 
05:32:17.948 --> 05:32:17.958 align:start position:0%
is responding to a real and great
 
05:32:20.868 --> 05:32:20.878 align:start position:0%
concern but the second even more
 
05:32:22.788 --> 05:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
overwhelming fact is that Epson
 
05:32:24.868 --> 05:32:24.878 align:start position:0%
residents are strong supporters of the
 
05:32:27.430 --> 05:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
local public schools some parents were
 
05:32:30.470 --> 05:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
brought to tears as they gave testimony
 
05:32:33.190 --> 05:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
because they felt that our commitment to
 
05:32:35.708 --> 05:32:35.718 align:start position:0%
education was faltering and it was
 
05:32:37.350 --> 05:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
potentially going to leave children
 
05:32:39.030 --> 05:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
especially children with special
 
05:32:41.590 --> 05:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
educational needs without
 
05:32:45.030 --> 05:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
support other citizens who do not have
 
05:32:47.270 --> 05:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
students in the schools Express strong
 
05:32:49.788 --> 05:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
support for public education for various
 
05:32:53.590 --> 05:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
reasons they want topnotch public school
 
05:32:55.868 --> 05:32:55.878 align:start position:0%
education and they want you their
 
05:32:58.670 --> 05:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
representatives to support the public
 
05:33:02.910 --> 05:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
schools HB 283 is the antithesis of
 
05:33:04.430 --> 05:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
support for public
 
05:33:06.990 --> 05:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
education it's astonishing that someone
 
05:33:09.590 --> 05:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
with a PhD and computer science from MIT
 
05:33:11.310 --> 05:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
would Advance the bill eliminating
 
05:33:13.470 --> 05:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
computer science engineering and
 
05:33:16.868 --> 05:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
Technology as necessary Ed if we could
 
05:33:20.190 --> 05:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
keep personalities out of this
 
05:33:26.628 --> 05:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
please Fair okay uh to repeat I don't
 
05:33:28.070 --> 05:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
think we should eliminate computer
 
05:33:30.350 --> 05:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
science engineering and Technology as
 
05:33:33.110 --> 05:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
necessary elements of public education
 
05:33:34.910 --> 05:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
does anyone here really believe that
 
05:33:36.990 --> 05:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
that would be beneficial would Christy
 
05:33:37.000 --> 05:33:38.270 align:start position:0%
that would be beneficial would Christy
mlli

05:33:38.270 --> 05:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
mlli
 
05:33:39.708 --> 05:33:39.718 align:start position:0%
agree that we should have taken that out
 
05:33:43.470 --> 05:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
of the her education I don't think so if
 
05:33:45.070 --> 05:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
you could wrap up please yeah I'm going
 
05:33:46.830 --> 05:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
to wrap it up thank you the word
 
05:33:48.390 --> 05:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
adequate in the title of the bill
 
05:33:51.430 --> 05:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
explains why HB 283 is before you the
 
05:33:53.350 --> 05:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
court rulings oblig the state to pay for
 
05:33:56.150 --> 05:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
an adequate education thus from a narrow
 
05:33:58.310 --> 05:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
view any withering of the scope of
 
05:34:01.230 --> 05:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
adequate education May save some money
 
05:34:02.910 --> 05:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
but that's not the call from epom
 
05:34:06.070 --> 05:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
residents they want Superior education
 
05:34:08.708 --> 05:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
not minimally adequate education and
 
05:34:10.470 --> 05:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
they need you to consider alternative
 
05:34:12.548 --> 05:34:12.558 align:start position:0%
means to fund that that it goes beyond
 
05:34:15.110 --> 05:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
regressive property taxes thank you
 
05:34:17.590 --> 05:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and again I'll repeat if you
 
05:34:19.590 --> 05:34:19.600 align:start position:0%

05:34:24.590 --> 05:34:24.600 align:start position:0%

05:36:06.150 --> 05:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
mcgan yes my name is Trisha Rose Bert
 
05:36:09.150 --> 05:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
I'm in from hancok new Hampshire I'm an
 
05:36:12.670 --> 05:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
artist and a creativity and story coach
 
05:36:15.628 --> 05:36:15.638 align:start position:0%
to businesses Across the Nation I
 
05:36:17.510 --> 05:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
haven't ever had a child in the New
 
05:36:19.548 --> 05:36:19.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public School System but the
 
05:36:21.948 --> 05:36:21.958 align:start position:0%
Arts uh changed my life and is very
 
05:36:24.430 --> 05:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
important to me um about three decades
 
05:36:26.910 --> 05:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
ago I was working as a consultant for
 
05:36:29.150 --> 05:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
Harvard Business School and Fidelity
 
05:36:31.708 --> 05:36:31.718 align:start position:0%
Investments and I was good at my job but
 
05:36:33.548 --> 05:36:33.558 align:start position:0%
I wasn't really enjoying it so I started
 
05:36:34.750 --> 05:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
figuring out what else I could do for a
 
05:36:37.708 --> 05:36:37.718 align:start position:0%
living and I ended up in art school
 
05:36:39.670 --> 05:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
which was a surprise because I live was
 
05:36:41.628 --> 05:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
raised with a family that really focused
 
05:36:44.510 --> 05:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
on hard skills like logic and math as
 
05:36:46.750 --> 05:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to the softer skills like
 
05:36:49.070 --> 05:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
creativity um and when I started going
 
05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
to Art School while I was Consulting I
 
05:36:55.070 --> 05:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
became a much better consultant because
 
05:36:57.510 --> 05:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
I was learning how to think creatively
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
and making art and practicing art uh
 
05:37:02.470 --> 05:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
really awakened my imagination and my
 
05:37:05.510 --> 05:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
ability to problem solve so what I do
 
05:37:09.390 --> 05:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
now I get hired by businesses because I
 
05:37:12.270 --> 05:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
am an artist and they asked me to come
 
05:37:15.628 --> 05:37:15.638 align:start position:0%
into their organizations to help their
 
05:37:19.430 --> 05:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
their employees think more creatively um
 
05:37:21.310 --> 05:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
and engage their creative sides in fact
 
05:37:23.830 --> 05:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
I was just hired by the National Council
 
05:37:25.830 --> 05:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
of state legislators to help their
 
05:37:28.548 --> 05:37:28.558 align:start position:0%
support staff um with their creativity
 
05:37:31.628 --> 05:37:31.638 align:start position:0%
so I think we have a choice uh we can
 
05:37:34.708 --> 05:37:34.718 align:start position:0%
eliminate Arts programs um maybe save
 
05:37:37.070 --> 05:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
some money and some Hassle and end up
 
05:37:40.788 --> 05:37:40.798 align:start position:0%
hiring someone like me later on um or we
 
05:37:43.230 --> 05:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
can invest in our students and in the
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
long term now so we can create uh
 
05:37:48.590 --> 05:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
creative thinkers and problem solvers uh
 
05:37:51.190 --> 05:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
creativity is something that is a musle
 
05:37:54.788 --> 05:37:54.798 align:start position:0%
that needs to be flexed early and often
 
05:37:57.628 --> 05:37:57.638 align:start position:0%
and and it can help our students become
 
05:37:59.830 --> 05:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
better citizens and navigate their own
 
05:38:02.390 --> 05:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
lives personally and professionally uh
 
05:38:05.510 --> 05:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
art and creativity are not frivolous
 
05:38:08.310 --> 05:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
Pursuits um it's a essential to the
 
05:38:12.070 --> 05:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
bottom line actually of every industry
 
05:38:14.070 --> 05:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship uh and leader in our
 
05:38:16.830 --> 05:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
state so I urge you to oppose this Bill
 
05:38:18.628 --> 05:38:18.638 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very
 
05:38:26.430 --> 05:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:29.310 --> 05:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
Macwan if she's not here we'll move on
 
05:38:31.470 --> 05:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
to Max
 
05:38:35.910 --> 05:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:38.150 --> 05:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
Andrews good afternoon members of the
 
05:38:40.788 --> 05:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Max Goddard I am a
 
05:38:43.070 --> 05:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizen um I grew up in
 
05:38:45.788 --> 05:38:45.798 align:start position:0%
marac New Hampshire um and received an
 
05:38:48.390 --> 05:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
extremely well-rounded education there
 
05:38:50.110 --> 05:38:50.120 align:start position:0%
um I wish I could go on and on about the
 
05:38:51.468 --> 05:38:51.478 align:start position:0%
various teachers I had and how
 
05:38:53.030 --> 05:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
exceptional they were but they're not
 
05:38:54.548 --> 05:38:54.558 align:start position:0%
public figure so I won't name them here
 
05:38:57.948 --> 05:38:57.958 align:start position:0%
today except for one of my uh former
 
05:39:00.070 --> 05:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
world history teacher is now one of your
 
05:39:01.830 --> 05:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh New Hampshire State Rep
 
05:39:04.708 --> 05:39:04.718 align:start position:0%
Peter patrino um and I will just say
 
05:39:07.670 --> 05:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
that he had an extreme impact on me um
 
05:39:10.990 --> 05:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
and many other New Hampshire citizens um
 
05:39:14.390 --> 05:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
and enabled us to see the world from a
 
05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
connected perspective
 
05:39:21.990 --> 05:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
um I've been trying to understand how
 
05:39:25.110 --> 05:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
the prime SP responser of this bill um
 
05:39:27.948 --> 05:39:27.958 align:start position:0%
could justify reducing the requirements
 
05:39:31.390 --> 05:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
of inadequate education in Hampshire um
 
05:39:33.150 --> 05:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
again let's please leave personalities
 
05:39:35.310 --> 05:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
out of this and stick to the uh Bill
 
05:39:38.150 --> 05:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
itself I was trying to find why anyone
 
05:39:40.548 --> 05:39:40.558 align:start position:0%
could justify such a bill in this before
 
05:39:45.750 --> 05:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
this committee um but today um I had the
 
05:39:47.708 --> 05:39:47.718 align:start position:0%
pleasure of uh hearing the prime
 
05:39:51.390 --> 05:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor's specific testimony to justify
 
05:39:53.868 --> 05:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
the lowering of the adequate education
 
05:39:57.390 --> 05:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
requirements in New Hampshire um and his
 
05:40:01.708 --> 05:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
primary uh reasoning seems to be that he
 
05:40:05.750 --> 05:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
views education as a zero sum game if we
 
05:40:08.030 --> 05:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
we're interested in your position
 
05:40:10.070 --> 05:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that education is a
 
05:40:13.948 --> 05:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
zero sum game teaching of one subject
 
05:40:17.310 --> 05:40:17.320 align:start position:0%
does not reduce the teaching of another
 
05:40:20.670 --> 05:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
subject if someone is studying civics
 
05:40:25.030 --> 05:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
government or history are they reducing
 
05:40:29.150 --> 05:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
the education of English a subject that
 
05:40:31.590 --> 05:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
uses writing reading and comprehension
 
05:40:34.468 --> 05:40:34.478 align:start position:0%
something that would be performed in all
 
05:40:36.190 --> 05:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
the subjects civics government in
 
05:40:38.628 --> 05:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
history would it be reducing a
 
05:40:41.548 --> 05:40:41.558 align:start position:0%
mathematics education to teach personal
 
05:40:43.350 --> 05:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
finance literacy computer science and
 
05:40:47.670 --> 05:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
technology subjects that certainly use
 
05:40:50.708 --> 05:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
it thank you any
 
05:40:53.590 --> 05:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
questions next is uh Katie Andrews
 
05:40:55.948 --> 05:40:55.958 align:start position:0%
followed by Cynthia
 
05:40:58.270 --> 05:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
McClary good afternoon thank you for
 
05:41:00.788 --> 05:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
having me I honestly didn't prepare
 
05:41:02.750 --> 05:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
anything I was in preparing to speak to
 
05:41:05.788 --> 05:41:05.798 align:start position:0%
you today um but as a mother of a
 
05:41:09.468 --> 05:41:09.478 align:start position:0%
seventh grader in sand down I don't see
 
05:41:12.510 --> 05:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
how I cannot um the people before me
 
05:41:14.670 --> 05:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
have done a fantastic job of showing how
 
05:41:18.310 --> 05:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
insane this bill actually is but I think
 
05:41:20.230 --> 05:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful for you to know that
 
05:41:21.910 --> 05:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
the reason my husband and I purchased
 
05:41:25.070 --> 05:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
our home in Sandown and have paid over
 
05:41:29.070 --> 05:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
$10,000 a year in property taxes was for
 
05:41:32.230 --> 05:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
our elementary school we chose to live
 
05:41:33.948 --> 05:41:33.958 align:start position:0%
there for our elementary school our
 
05:41:36.190 --> 05:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
daughter got an amazing education we are
 
05:41:37.750 --> 05:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
very grateful
 
05:41:41.590 --> 05:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill she's an honors
 
05:41:44.628 --> 05:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
Orchestra student she's a 504 student
 
05:41:47.230 --> 05:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
what you are contemplating cutting from
 
05:41:48.990 --> 05:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
this education
 
05:41:53.150 --> 05:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
system makes us go our neighboring
 
05:41:55.708 --> 05:41:55.718 align:start position:0%
states have quality education and
 
05:41:59.230 --> 05:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
similar property taxes I don't see why
 
05:42:00.788 --> 05:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
we would stay in New Hampshire if you
 
05:42:03.910 --> 05:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
pass this bill I also have a question
 
05:42:06.788 --> 05:42:06.798 align:start position:0%
for the sponsor I'm a little perplexed
 
05:42:08.990 --> 05:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
is to how you
 
05:42:13.190 --> 05:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
chose these courses to cut um why is
 
05:42:14.788 --> 05:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
physical education more important than
 
05:42:18.110 --> 05:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
arts or music why is personal finance or
 
05:42:20.150 --> 05:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
economics not important when math is
 
05:42:23.548 --> 05:42:23.558 align:start position:0%
important and it overlaps so much I I
 
05:42:25.468 --> 05:42:25.478 align:start position:0%
don't understand and would love to get
 
05:42:28.830 --> 05:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
some more clarification as to how these
 
05:42:30.230 --> 05:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
were arbitrarily
 
05:42:32.150 --> 05:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
chosen thank
 
05:42:34.270 --> 05:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
05:42:38.948 --> 05:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:47.350 --> 05:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:50.150 --> 05:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
Ward good afternoon my name is Janet
 
05:42:52.830 --> 05:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
Ward I live in Hopkinton New
 
05:42:55.548 --> 05:42:55.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am here because I am
 
05:42:59.110 --> 05:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
appalled by House Bill 283 proposed by
 
05:43:00.910 --> 05:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
representative Dan
 
05:43:03.468 --> 05:43:03.478 align:start position:0%
Maguire how is it possible that
 
05:43:05.910 --> 05:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire could propose a
 
05:43:07.910 --> 05:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
bill in the year
 
05:43:10.708 --> 05:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
2025 which would remove from core
 
05:43:13.390 --> 05:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge domains World languages
 
05:43:15.990 --> 05:43:16.000 align:start position:0%

05:43:19.350 --> 05:43:19.360 align:start position:0%

05:43:21.750 --> 05:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
and Holocaust and genocide
 
05:43:24.708 --> 05:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
education has representative Maguire not
 
05:43:27.150 --> 05:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
noticed that thanks to tremendous
 
05:43:29.030 --> 05:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
advances in communication and
 
05:43:31.708 --> 05:43:31.718 align:start position:0%
transportation technology all of us
 
05:43:35.150 --> 05:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
humans inhabit a small planet where what
 
05:43:37.708 --> 05:43:37.718 align:start position:0%
happens in one nation rapidly affects
 
05:43:40.548 --> 05:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
all other nations among many of its
 
05:43:42.788 --> 05:43:42.798 align:start position:0%
potentially damaging effects this bill
 
05:43:44.708 --> 05:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
would limit the ability of our young
 
05:43:47.030 --> 05:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
people to converse and communicate with
 
05:43:49.590 --> 05:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
citizens of other nations and to develop
 
05:43:51.788 --> 05:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
an understanding of the different ways
 
05:43:55.670 --> 05:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
human governments evolve in 2025
 
05:43:58.670 --> 05:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
studying C Civics is more crucial than
 
05:44:02.030 --> 05:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
ever through the study of civics young
 
05:44:04.708 --> 05:44:04.718 align:start position:0%
people come to understand and appreciate
 
05:44:08.070 --> 05:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
the amazing possibilities of democracy
 
05:44:10.230 --> 05:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
as well as the threats to our democracy
 
05:44:13.070 --> 05:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
that are right now at this moment in
 
05:44:15.788 --> 05:44:15.798 align:start position:0%
play the sponsor of this bill could
 
05:44:17.910 --> 05:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
argue that he is only interested in
 
05:44:22.350 --> 05:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
saving taxpayers money let us be honest
 
05:44:24.708 --> 05:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
if that were truly the case this
 
05:44:27.030 --> 05:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
committee could save taxpayers money and
 
05:44:29.590 --> 05:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
protect our public schools by ensuring
 
05:44:32.670 --> 05:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
that public tax dollars pay for our
 
05:44:36.070 --> 05:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
public schools and are not siphoned off
 
05:44:38.948 --> 05:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
via School vouchers which Escape public
 
05:44:41.390 --> 05:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
oversight if we could stick to this bill
 
05:44:43.590 --> 05:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
voucher dollars represent taxation
 
05:44:45.230 --> 05:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
without representation excuse me if we
 
05:44:46.948 --> 05:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
could stick to this bill please happily
 
05:44:50.350 --> 05:44:50.360 align:start position:0%
sir but I do think what I've just said
 
05:44:53.070 --> 05:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
is connected I ask each of you to
 
05:44:55.628 --> 05:44:55.638 align:start position:0%
protect our democracy by voting against

05:45:30.948 --> 05:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
subjects while still maintaining that
 
05:45:32.788 --> 05:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
this will provide an adequate Ed
 
05:45:35.750 --> 05:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
education for our students I'll limit my

05:45:51.830 --> 05:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
will be taught in these Social Studies
 
05:45:54.788 --> 05:45:54.798 align:start position:0%

communities systems and their
 
05:46:14.190 --> 05:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
interactions uh across time and place
 
05:46:16.990 --> 05:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
that prepare students for local National
 
05:46:19.628 --> 05:46:19.638 align:start position:0%
and Global Civic life don't we really
 
05:46:22.390 --> 05:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
want to have our students uh especially
 
05:46:25.628 --> 05:46:25.638 align:start position:0%
in today's world participate in that
 
05:46:28.670 --> 05:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
second point is that on August 4th
 
05:46:31.990 --> 05:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
2023 Governor sonunu signed into law

05:46:46.510 --> 05:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
this bipartisan bill was sponsored by 16
 
05:46:51.030 --> 05:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
Senators this uh are we going to undo
 
05:46:53.670 --> 05:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
this law that is just beginning to be
 
05:46:55.670 --> 05:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
implemented in our
 
05:46:58.510 --> 05:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
schools finally of all the subjects on
 
05:47:01.230 --> 05:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
this list one should not discount the
 
05:47:04.830 --> 05:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
one entitled personal finance
 
05:47:07.670 --> 05:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
literacy imagine if all all our students
 
05:47:10.030 --> 05:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
who graduate from high school got at
 
05:47:13.670 --> 05:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
least a passing grade in
 
05:47:16.708 --> 05:47:16.718 align:start position:0%

Federation of teachers New Hampshire and
 
05:48:10.270 --> 05:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
am here on behalf of my members and the

students we serve across the granite
 
05:48:15.510 --> 05:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
state to oppose House Bill
 
05:48:18.350 --> 05:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
283 uh we are in staunch opposition of
 
05:48:22.150 --> 05:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
this bill which would cut many uh
 
05:48:25.910 --> 05:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
subject areas from the list of classes
 
05:48:27.590 --> 05:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
that are required or list of areas that
 
05:48:31.310 --> 05:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
are required uh to make up an adequate
 
05:48:34.230 --> 05:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
education every single Granite State
 
05:48:37.150 --> 05:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
student has the constitutional right to
 
05:48:39.468 --> 05:48:39.478 align:start position:0%
the opportunity of a robust public
 
05:48:41.590 --> 05:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
education that's not a barebones
 
05:48:43.190 --> 05:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
education that's an education that
 
05:48:47.430 --> 05:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
prepares them for career for Workforce
 
05:48:49.750 --> 05:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
for higher education for full
 
05:48:53.030 --> 05:48:53.040 align:start position:0%

05:48:53.040 --> 05:48:54.510 align:start position:0%
participation in Civic life beyond High
School

05:48:54.510 --> 05:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
School
 
05:48:57.150 --> 05:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
graduation this bill will not get our
 
05:48:59.830 --> 05:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
students there and it is short changing
 
05:49:02.708 --> 05:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
them if we adopt it by changing the list
 
05:49:05.190 --> 05:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
of subjects that comprise an adequate
 
05:49:07.708 --> 05:49:07.718 align:start position:0%
education it will eventually affect
 
05:49:09.110 --> 05:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
funding because that is what our funding
 
05:49:13.390 --> 05:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
formula is based on and if our state
 
05:49:16.390 --> 05:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
does not fund it in many places our
 
05:49:18.868 --> 05:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
local districts cannot continue to fund
 
05:49:20.548 --> 05:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
it so it's fine to say well your local
 
05:49:23.390 --> 05:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
schools can still offer these subjects
 
05:49:25.548 --> 05:49:25.558 align:start position:0%
most of our local districts are so
 
05:49:28.150 --> 05:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
strapped by our current unconstitutional
 
05:49:31.830 --> 05:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
funding formula that they are struggling
 
05:49:34.708 --> 05:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
to keep up with what they are currently
 
05:49:37.830 --> 05:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
offering and in many places is you see
 
05:49:40.708 --> 05:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
right now there are cutbacks on the
 
05:49:45.030 --> 05:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
table it would continue to grow that Gap
 
05:49:46.948 --> 05:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
we have from one District to another
 
05:49:49.030 --> 05:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
between what is offered in a public
 
05:49:51.590 --> 05:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
education and remember every single
 
05:49:53.708 --> 05:49:53.718 align:start position:0%
child in the state has the right to that
 
05:49:56.788 --> 05:49:56.798 align:start position:0%
same robust opportunity of a public
 
05:49:59.510 --> 05:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
education so for the sake of all of our
 
05:50:02.310 --> 05:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
grand estate children you really need to
 
05:50:04.510 --> 05:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
find this an expedient to legislate and
 
05:50:06.708 --> 05:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
I do have copies I'll bring them down
 
05:50:10.628 --> 05:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
thank you U Mike um followed by uh is
 
05:50:13.548 --> 05:50:13.558 align:start position:0%
there someone named Dan just filled in
 
05:50:16.030 --> 05:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
first name if you could when you get up
 
05:50:17.548 --> 05:50:17.558 align:start position:0%
if you could tell us your last name also
 
05:50:18.548 --> 05:50:18.558 align:start position:0%
for the
 
05:50:22.708 --> 05:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:24.708 --> 05:50:24.718 align:start position:0%

Greater ashaa I'm here also to express
 
05:50:33.350 --> 05:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
our strong opposition to HB
 
05:50:35.350 --> 05:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
283 just going to make a couple of
 
05:50:36.670 --> 05:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
additional points that haven't been made
 
05:50:38.990 --> 05:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
made that this proposal it's not only
 
05:50:40.270 --> 05:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the future of our
 
05:50:42.548 --> 05:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
students but it also contradicts
 
05:50:44.990 --> 05:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
long-established brain science regarding
 
05:50:47.628 --> 05:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
how children learn and develop I'd like
 
05:50:49.868 --> 05:50:49.878 align:start position:0%
to give you just a couple of examples
 
05:50:51.670 --> 05:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
Decades of research in neuroscience and
 
05:50:53.070 --> 05:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
education have shown a diverse and
 
05:50:55.430 --> 05:50:55.440 align:start position:0%

point I am the product of a well-rounded

to be a critical thinker in this world
 
05:53:10.350 --> 05:53:10.360 align:start position:0%

we're able to think independently and
 
05:53:15.030 --> 05:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
analyze and use our brains to figure out

I'm a faculty member in the music
 
05:54:47.510 --> 05:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
department at Keen State College I'm
 
05:54:50.708 --> 05:54:50.718 align:start position:0%
here to strongly oppose HB 283 our
 
05:54:52.270 --> 05:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
children deserve a well-rounded
 
05:54:54.468 --> 05:54:54.478 align:start position:0%
education I have professional training
 
05:54:55.990 --> 05:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
in both the Arts and the sciences and
 
05:54:57.468 --> 05:54:57.478 align:start position:0%
I'd like to talk about the importance of
 
05:54:59.910 --> 05:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
Arts in education people think
 
05:55:01.990 --> 05:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
creativity is associated with the Arts
 
05:55:04.350 --> 05:55:04.360 align:start position:0%
and while this is true it would be wrong
 
05:55:06.310 --> 05:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
to assume that creativity somehow belong
 
05:55:09.030 --> 05:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
bels to the Arts as a former chemist my
 
05:55:11.830 --> 05:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
work in the lab required creativity my
 
05:55:13.708 --> 05:55:13.718 align:start position:0%
electrician is one of the most creative
 
05:55:16.430 --> 05:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
people I know from marketing Specialists
 
05:55:19.230 --> 05:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
to dentists and doctors creativity is a
 
05:55:20.948 --> 05:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
critical component of
 
05:55:23.390 --> 05:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
success as a faculty member at Keen
 
05:55:25.590 --> 05:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
State we talk a lot about Job Readiness
 
05:55:27.510 --> 05:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to apply one's skills to the
 
05:55:29.708 --> 05:55:29.718 align:start position:0%
job market to be a productive member of
 
05:55:32.230 --> 05:55:32.240 align:start position:0%

05:55:34.150 --> 05:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
students for success in the New
 
05:55:36.510 --> 05:55:36.520 align:start position:0%

think
 
05:55:40.510 --> 05:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
creatively the Arts are also a vehicle
 
05:55:42.990 --> 05:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
for important life skills students who
 
05:55:44.948 --> 05:55:44.958 align:start position:0%

Technologies they are not afraid to take
 
05:56:04.390 --> 05:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
risks the Arts teach discipline and work
 
05:56:06.708 --> 05:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
ethic in other words our school C culum
 
05:56:08.548 --> 05:56:08.558 align:start position:0%
benefits from the Arts in many
 
05:56:11.150 --> 05:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
immeasurable ways this is not about
 
05:56:13.110 --> 05:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
teaching our kids a form of
 
05:56:15.510 --> 05:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
entertainment after all the ma the vast
 
05:56:17.230 --> 05:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
majority of our students who study the
 
05:56:19.708 --> 05:56:19.718 align:start position:0%
Arts in the K through2 system will not
 
05:56:21.750 --> 05:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
go on to become professional musicians
 
05:56:24.230 --> 05:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
or painters or actors this is about
 
05:56:25.990 --> 05:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
building a school curriculum that will
 
05:56:29.190 --> 05:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
set our kids on a path to success in any
 
05:56:31.868 --> 05:56:31.878 align:start position:0%
field they choose what kind of education
 
05:56:33.670 --> 05:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
will position our children for the best

05:56:40.948 --> 05:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes to eliminate please I
 
05:56:43.030 --> 05:56:43.040 align:start position:0%

05:56:46.070 --> 05:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate give our youth
 
05:56:48.510 --> 05:56:48.520 align:start position:0%

05:57:19.350 --> 05:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
I'm now an assistant at the Hollis

montauri school I am here to very much
 
05:57:27.030 --> 05:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 283 I have four main points
 
05:57:28.468 --> 05:57:28.478 align:start position:0%
the first thing is I think that this is
 
05:57:31.030 --> 05:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
a very disrespectful bill I think
 
05:57:34.788 --> 05:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
teachers did not go to six or four plus
 
05:57:36.708 --> 05:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
six years for a back bachor and a
 
05:57:39.510 --> 05:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
master's degree to teach to ATT test to
 
05:57:41.548 --> 05:57:41.558 align:start position:0%
teach only limited subjects in the
 
05:57:43.948 --> 05:57:43.958 align:start position:0%
schools they love children they're
 
05:57:45.990 --> 05:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
passionate about what they do they're
 
05:57:48.868 --> 05:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
creative about what they do and I find
 
05:57:51.788 --> 05:57:51.798 align:start position:0%
it a disrespectful bill for that reason
 
05:57:54.468 --> 05:57:54.478 align:start position:0%
students don't want to be dumbed down
 
05:57:57.230 --> 05:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
parents want a quality education I think
 
05:57:59.230 --> 05:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
these things go without
 
05:58:01.830 --> 05:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
speaking um I also feel this bill is
 
05:58:04.628 --> 05:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
ignorant of educational theory pedagogy
 
05:58:07.468 --> 05:58:07.478 align:start position:0%
psychology curriculum design cognitive
 
05:58:10.708 --> 05:58:10.718 align:start position:0%
function and brain development as Dr
 
05:58:13.230 --> 05:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
Howard Gardner of Harvard University
 
05:58:16.670 --> 05:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
said we have multiple intelligence
 
05:58:19.390 --> 05:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
intelligences spatial
 
05:58:23.070 --> 05:58:23.080 align:start position:0%
artistic um cooking
 
05:58:26.548 --> 05:58:26.558 align:start position:0%
musical uh help me here there were about
 
05:58:29.110 --> 05:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
eight of them much more than just the
 
05:58:32.948 --> 05:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
disciplines of math reading and writing
 
05:58:35.190 --> 05:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
and therefore you need to appeal to all
 
05:58:36.830 --> 05:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
those intelligence
 
05:58:39.670 --> 05:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
by including all these subject areas
 
05:58:40.708 --> 05:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
when you
 
05:58:43.750 --> 05:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
teach um I really much think that
 
05:58:45.230 --> 05:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
education is
 
05:58:49.150 --> 05:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary no one can argue that
 
05:58:51.510 --> 05:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
math has nothing to do with any of the
 
05:58:54.750 --> 05:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
other subjects no one can argue that
 
05:58:56.468 --> 05:58:56.478 align:start position:0%
science doesn't have something to do
 
05:58:58.708 --> 05:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
with history that music doesn't have
 
05:59:01.350 --> 05:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
something to do with math as other
 
05:59:04.788 --> 05:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
people have said the brain doesn't learn
 
05:59:07.350 --> 05:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
math in one section and English in
 
05:59:09.868 --> 05:59:09.878 align:start position:0%
another section and writing everything
 
05:59:12.910 --> 05:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
is connected we're also connected as a
 
05:59:15.070 --> 05:59:15.080 align:start position:0%
world we cannot have an ethnocentric
 
05:59:17.990 --> 05:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
education and we can't have a Department
 
05:59:20.310 --> 05:59:20.320 align:start position:0%

05:59:22.990 --> 05:59:23.000 align:start position:0%

06:00:17.230 --> 06:00:17.240 align:start position:0%
but growing up here I always felt like
 
06:00:18.788 --> 06:00:18.798 align:start position:0%
something was missing in my life and it
 
06:00:21.670 --> 06:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
was being an artist I had art class at
 
06:00:25.430 --> 06:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
15 at Salem High School but didn't have
 
06:00:28.910 --> 06:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
what it took to get into a school after
 
06:00:30.868 --> 06:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
I couldn't get into certain colleges or
 
06:00:34.788 --> 06:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
even Artmy because I didn't have enough
 
06:00:37.070 --> 06:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
art under my belt
 
06:00:40.310 --> 06:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
um and I was upset by that and my skills
 
06:00:41.590 --> 06:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
could have been better if I started
 
06:00:43.628 --> 06:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
right from the beginning and learning
 
06:00:46.270 --> 06:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
more I didn't get that so all the more
 
06:00:48.708 --> 06:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
reason I fought hard I became a graphic
 
06:00:50.310 --> 06:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
designer I went to a three-year Art
 
06:00:52.590 --> 06:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
School the one that let me in in Boston
 
06:00:56.110 --> 06:00:56.120 align:start position:0%
and I did do well from there I moved to
 
06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
California and I did commercial artwork
 
06:01:00.868 --> 06:01:00.878 align:start position:0%
for a while then I had children and I
 
06:01:02.830 --> 06:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
decided I loved teaching them and
 
06:01:05.030 --> 06:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
teaching art they didn't have art in
 
06:01:08.030 --> 06:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
their classes and California 40 kids per
 
06:01:09.670 --> 06:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
a first grade classroom my daughter
 
06:01:11.910 --> 06:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
still wasn't reading and this is very
 
06:01:15.750 --> 06:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
personal so it's my own story when we
 
06:01:17.628 --> 06:01:17.638 align:start position:0%
ended up moving back to New Hampshire
 
06:01:21.230 --> 06:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
where my kids have never been but um and
 
06:01:24.510 --> 06:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
with a my husband and and two kids they
 
06:01:27.468 --> 06:01:27.478 align:start position:0%
got to go to London Derry school system
 
06:01:30.910 --> 06:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
and I was beaming at the changes that I
 
06:01:33.750 --> 06:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
saw in my children's education from
 
06:01:36.430 --> 06:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
being here number one less CL less
 
06:01:39.350 --> 06:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
people in a class my daughter who was um
 
06:01:41.468 --> 06:01:41.478 align:start position:0%
still in first grade still couldn't read
 
06:01:43.990 --> 06:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
she learned to read in two months being
 
06:01:46.430 --> 06:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
here they integrated storytelling and
 
06:01:49.510 --> 06:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
drawing that embellished that for her so
 
06:01:52.270 --> 06:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
I'm so proud of being a member I was
 
06:01:54.430 --> 06:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
raised in New Hampshire I'm prouder to
 
06:01:56.390 --> 06:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
be a part of New Hampshire now and I got
 
06:01:58.788 --> 06:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
to be an educator at the school district
 
06:02:01.910 --> 06:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
in Jerry and I can't tell you enough how
 
06:02:04.750 --> 06:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
much it meant to me to see my my

students do better and flourish so thank
 
06:02:10.590 --> 06:02:10.600 align:start position:0%

hopkington New Hampshire and I'm also a
 
06:02:27.590 --> 06:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
sixth grade teacher of social studies
 
06:02:30.788 --> 06:02:30.798 align:start position:0%

06:02:34.390 --> 06:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
Civics I moved here about 28 years
 
06:02:37.590 --> 06:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
ago um from from the state of Florida
 
06:02:39.788 --> 06:02:39.798 align:start position:0%
and I was immediately impressed by the
 
06:02:42.110 --> 06:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and its Common
 
06:02:44.468 --> 06:02:44.478 align:start position:0%

tirelessly to educate our children I've
 
06:02:56.310 --> 06:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
taught all of those core subjects that
 
06:02:58.628 --> 06:02:58.638 align:start position:0%
we were talking about but I firmly
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
believe that art and music and World
 
06:03:02.948 --> 06:03:02.958 align:start position:0%

06:03:22.310 --> 06:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
bills like HB 283 only disrupt our work
 
06:03:25.150 --> 06:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm very much opposed to it um only
 
06:03:28.030 --> 06:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago
 
06:03:32.150 --> 06:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
um my hopk students and I were invited
 
06:03:35.468 --> 06:03:35.478 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire state supreme court
 
06:03:37.628 --> 06:03:37.638 align:start position:0%

about

about
 
06:03:42.510 --> 06:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
Civics my students let the group know
 
06:03:46.030 --> 06:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
how they felt it prepared them for the
 
06:03:48.468 --> 06:03:48.478 align:start position:0%
future and that they learned that one
 
06:03:51.150 --> 06:03:51.160 align:start position:0%

and how to testify in front of

also on the school board for oyer River
 
06:05:20.070 --> 06:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District I'm not
 
06:05:21.468 --> 06:05:21.478 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the entire board
 
06:05:23.830 --> 06:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
today I'm speaking of myself um I'm on
 
06:05:26.070 --> 06:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
the finance committee there as well as
 
06:05:28.150 --> 06:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
sustainability and uh there's a lot of
 
06:05:29.510 --> 06:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
things here that a lot of people have
 
06:05:31.350 --> 06:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
discussed and mentioned in a much more
 
06:05:33.270 --> 06:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
eloquent way than I can do today and I'm
 
06:05:34.830 --> 06:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
very grateful for all the speakers who
 
06:05:36.788 --> 06:05:36.798 align:start position:0%
came up here and spoke so well about
 
06:05:39.430 --> 06:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
their personal experiences as Educators
 
06:05:42.430 --> 06:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
and parents and the importance of having
 
06:05:44.230 --> 06:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
this bill be defeated hopefully be in
 
06:05:45.270 --> 06:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
expedient to
 
06:05:47.110 --> 06:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
legislate I'm speaking today because
 
06:05:48.510 --> 06:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
there's a couple things one is I want to
 
06:05:49.910 --> 06:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that my voice was heard and I
 
06:05:51.628 --> 06:05:51.638 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize that the people who
 
06:05:53.230 --> 06:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
registered in opposition to this bill
 
06:05:55.350 --> 06:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
and even the ones who registered in
 
06:05:57.910 --> 06:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill online are equal in
 
06:05:59.390 --> 06:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
testimony to what I'm saying today I
 
06:06:00.628 --> 06:06:00.638 align:start position:0%
don't think we should be able to ignore
 
06:06:02.270 --> 06:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
the people who are not able to be
 
06:06:04.230 --> 06:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
present the second thing is is that when
 
06:06:05.310 --> 06:06:05.320 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about the school district
 
06:06:06.788 --> 06:06:06.798 align:start position:0%
that I'm in one of the things that's the
 
06:06:07.990 --> 06:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
strength of our district is that there's
 
06:06:09.110 --> 06:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of electives that the
 
06:06:10.990 --> 06:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
students can take people actually come
 
06:06:14.110 --> 06:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
to the district for that this bill is
 
06:06:15.350 --> 06:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
actually going to be eliminating a lot
 
06:06:16.910 --> 06:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
of those electives which means they
 
06:06:18.390 --> 06:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
won't have the diversity of classes of
 
06:06:19.548 --> 06:06:19.558 align:start position:0%
why they actually moved to the schools
 
06:06:21.830 --> 06:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
district to the in the first place the
 
06:06:24.390 --> 06:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
second part is is that we don't know
 
06:06:27.270 --> 06:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
what the future looks like if you're
 
06:06:29.190 --> 06:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
limiting everything into little boxes
 
06:06:30.868 --> 06:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
you're limitating people's and
 
06:06:32.670 --> 06:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
children's ability to adapt to the
 
06:06:36.350 --> 06:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
Future the exact skills that you need
 
06:06:38.670 --> 06:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
change what we actually really need is
 
06:06:41.150 --> 06:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
the ability to learn and having an
 
06:06:43.150 --> 06:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
expansive set of classes so we can do
 
06:06:45.788 --> 06:06:45.798 align:start position:0%
that is pivotal we need people in
 
06:06:47.590 --> 06:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
students in the future who are adaptable
 
06:06:49.510 --> 06:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
who are resilient who can be independent
 
06:06:51.548 --> 06:06:51.558 align:start position:0%
thinkers capable of critical analysis
 
06:06:54.310 --> 06:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
effective communication problem solving
 
06:06:56.548 --> 06:06:56.558 align:start position:0%
this bill cuts into all of those things
 
06:06:59.030 --> 06:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
because education doesn't exist in a
 
06:07:00.788 --> 06:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
silo when you're learning something it
 
06:07:02.830 --> 06:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
crosses all those classes other people
 
06:07:05.230 --> 06:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
have spoken to this exact thing where
 
06:07:07.030 --> 06:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
math math doesn't just exist in a math
 
06:07:08.830 --> 06:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
class math exists in art class it
 
06:07:10.310 --> 06:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
definitely exists in engineering class
 
06:07:12.390 --> 06:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
it exists in all those other places
 
06:07:13.468 --> 06:07:13.478 align:start position:0%
another thing I'd like to add just is
 
06:07:15.070 --> 06:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
saying with a Schoolboard member is that
 
06:07:16.548 --> 06:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of these things actually under
 
06:07:18.910 --> 06:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
company based education cross classes
 
06:07:18.920 --> 06:07:19.910 align:start position:0%
company based education cross classes
and

06:07:19.910 --> 06:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:07:22.430 --> 06:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
credits so just one second so the thing
 
06:07:24.190 --> 06:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
is is what this bill actually is doing
 
06:07:25.990 --> 06:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
is attacking the funding on it so I want
 
06:07:27.350 --> 06:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
to say that one of the person spoke to
 
06:07:28.868 --> 06:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
this much better than I did here since
 
06:07:31.270 --> 06:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
I'm out of time but the people who are
 
06:07:32.230 --> 06:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
sitting here and the people who have
 
06:07:33.910 --> 06:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
commented online are not fooled by the
 
06:07:36.548 --> 06:07:36.558 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill this bill is to
 
06:07:39.030 --> 06:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
attack adequacy funding and make it so
 
06:07:40.670 --> 06:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
public education is under attack and
 
06:07:42.430 --> 06:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
make it so it's underfunded that is the
 
06:07:43.910 --> 06:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
purpose of this
 
06:07:47.030 --> 06:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill so please in this be to legislate
 
06:07:48.510 --> 06:07:48.520 align:start position:0%

for the record I'm State Rep hope Damon
 
06:08:09.270 --> 06:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
representing the nine communities of
 
06:08:11.510 --> 06:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
Sullivan District 8 which includes five
 
06:08:13.868 --> 06:08:13.878 align:start position:0%
school districts all with significant
 
06:08:15.350 --> 06:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
participation in the free and reduced
 
06:08:17.750 --> 06:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
School meals program as many know a
 
06:08:20.948 --> 06:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
marker of low socioeconomic status I
 
06:08:23.230 --> 06:08:23.240 align:start position:0%
live in and represent the small town of
 
06:08:26.430 --> 06:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
cin in 2022 our school budget was cut
 
06:08:29.070 --> 06:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
53% following a floor motion by a free
 
06:08:32.990 --> 06:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
stator the vote was 20 to 14 if that had
 
06:08:34.830 --> 06:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
been the final outcome our school would
 
06:08:36.510 --> 06:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
have closed
 
06:08:38.750 --> 06:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
this bill though promoted by the sponsor
 
06:08:41.628 --> 06:08:41.638 align:start position:0%
as increasing local control is actually
 
06:08:44.350 --> 06:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
fully aligned with the Free State agenda
 
06:08:46.830 --> 06:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
reduce course requirements to minimal so
 
06:08:48.910 --> 06:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
the state can provide even less funding
 
06:08:51.670 --> 06:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
than it already inadequately does which
 
06:08:54.310 --> 06:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
will certainly reduce education quality
 
06:08:57.190 --> 06:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
and outcomes and then the free sters can
 
06:08:59.910 --> 06:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
further dismantle Public Schools until
 
06:09:03.350 --> 06:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
eventually none exist in New
 
06:09:06.070 --> 06:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire after a 7 we Grassroots
 
06:09:08.670 --> 06:09:08.680 align:start position:0%
campaign cyon restored our school budget
 
06:09:10.548 --> 06:09:10.558 align:start position:0%
in a landslide
 
06:09:13.708 --> 06:09:13.718 align:start position:0%
377-2 vote there's only 600 voters in
 
06:09:17.590 --> 06:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
our town similarly the 29,000 opponents
 
06:09:20.670 --> 06:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
to this bill online and have you noticed
 
06:09:23.070 --> 06:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
that 100% of the people testifying in
 
06:09:26.868 --> 06:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
person today oppose HB 283 should tell
 
06:09:30.070 --> 06:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
the house to defeat this egregious Bill
 
06:09:33.708 --> 06:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
and finally it alerts all of us to vet
 
06:09:35.948 --> 06:09:35.958 align:start position:0%
who you elect to represent
 
06:09:37.868 --> 06:09:37.878 align:start position:0%
free Staters do not support public
 
06:09:41.030 --> 06:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
education where 87% of New Hampshire
 
06:09:45.070 --> 06:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
kada 12 students learn thank you thank
 
06:09:53.390 --> 06:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:57.230 --> 06:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
Burke yes good afternoon members of the
 
06:09:59.590 --> 06:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
education policy and administration
 
06:10:02.708 --> 06:10:02.718 align:start position:0%
committee my name is lesie Woodard from
 
06:10:04.070 --> 06:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm from
 
06:10:07.350 --> 06:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
Londoner I'm a retired music teacher
 
06:10:10.830 --> 06:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
from there and my husband and I moved
 
06:10:13.670 --> 06:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:17.788 --> 06:10:17.798 align:start position:0%
daughter because of the education she
 
06:10:21.910 --> 06:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
would receive there especially the Arts
 
06:10:25.230 --> 06:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
education I oppose this bill for many
 
06:10:28.310 --> 06:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
reasons by removing so many subjects
 
06:10:31.070 --> 06:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
important to a full and happy life this
 
06:10:34.708 --> 06:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
bill excuse me will make learning a
 
06:10:37.830 --> 06:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
drudgery for students and much more
 
06:10:40.390 --> 06:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
difficult for many students as students
 
06:10:43.868 --> 06:10:43.878 align:start position:0%
learn in many different ways it will
 
06:10:45.910 --> 06:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
also be a disaster for their future
 
06:10:48.190 --> 06:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
lives leaving them with many fewer
 
06:10:50.350 --> 06:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
career paths and giving them virtually
 
06:10:53.350 --> 06:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
no education about the world or how it
 
06:10:56.190 --> 06:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
works this will also be a disaster for
 
06:10:58.030 --> 06:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
our country and our world in the long
 
06:11:01.150 --> 06:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
run I am here in part because I have 10
 
06:11:04.350 --> 06:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
grandchildren four of whom attend school
 
06:11:05.910 --> 06:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
06:11:08.270 --> 06:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
I do not want to see them relegated to
 
06:11:10.468 --> 06:11:10.478 align:start position:0%
this below subpar
 
06:11:13.350 --> 06:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
education the Arts help a child to learn
 
06:11:15.708 --> 06:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
about themselves in the world as well as
 
06:11:17.948 --> 06:11:17.958 align:start position:0%
their place in
 
06:11:20.708 --> 06:11:20.718 align:start position:0%
it Studies have proven that students do
 
06:11:22.468 --> 06:11:22.478 align:start position:0%
better in academic classes when they're
 
06:11:24.548 --> 06:11:24.558 align:start position:0%
involved in playing a music
 
06:11:27.590 --> 06:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
instrument also the Arts bring people
 
06:11:31.310 --> 06:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
together which I have seen over and over
 
06:11:34.830 --> 06:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
again as a certified music practitioner
 
06:11:37.590 --> 06:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
I also know the Arts are healing I've
 
06:11:39.390 --> 06:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
personally experienced this healing and
 
06:11:43.468 --> 06:11:43.478 align:start position:0%
watched it happen over and over again as
 
06:11:46.150 --> 06:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
well the Arts tie all other subjects
 
06:11:48.948 --> 06:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
together it is definitely a big part of
 
06:11:51.830 --> 06:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
an adequate education I respectfully
 
06:11:54.310 --> 06:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
asked what could possibly make anyone
 
06:11:56.310 --> 06:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
think that social studies are not part
 
06:11:58.390 --> 06:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
of an adequate
 
06:12:01.430 --> 06:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
education and without
 
06:12:05.468 --> 06:12:05.478 align:start position:0%
those that's two minutes already
 
06:12:08.130 --> 06:12:08.140 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say that
 
06:12:08.140 --> 06:12:10.750 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say that
[Music]

06:12:10.750 --> 06:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:12:15.948 --> 06:12:15.958 align:start position:0%
um with other languages when I worked at
 
06:12:18.510 --> 06:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
Nike years ago one of my bosses could
 
06:12:22.030 --> 06:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
speak eight languages they sent her all
 
06:12:24.468 --> 06:12:24.478 align:start position:0%
over the world being able to speak so
 
06:12:27.708 --> 06:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
many languages opened up not only the
 
06:12:31.150 --> 06:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
world of work to her but the world
 
06:12:34.270 --> 06:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
itself we cannot take that away from our
 
06:12:34.280 --> 06:12:35.830 align:start position:0%
itself we cannot take that away from our
children

06:12:35.830 --> 06:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:12:39.708 --> 06:12:39.718 align:start position:0%
um please I feel the same yes about the
 
06:12:42.510 --> 06:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
others and I just wanted to say
 
06:12:46.270 --> 06:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate you're listening to my
 
06:12:49.910 --> 06:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and I hope all will oppose
 
06:12:53.190 --> 06:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
this egregious bill that would dumb down
 
06:12:55.910 --> 06:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
our children's education thank you so
 
06:12:59.150 --> 06:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
much for listening thank you is Bruce
 
06:12:59.160 --> 06:13:00.190 align:start position:0%
much for listening thank you is Bruce
Burke

06:13:00.190 --> 06:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
Burke
 
06:13:03.190 --> 06:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
here followed by Dave M I have to say a
 
06:13:05.628 --> 06:13:05.638 align:start position:0%
couple things in uh I've listened
 
06:13:07.788 --> 06:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
carefully so I'm going to eliminate most
 
06:13:10.468 --> 06:13:10.478 align:start position:0%
of my comments thank you for being the
 
06:13:12.590 --> 06:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
most underpaid Professionals in the
 
06:13:16.030 --> 06:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
State uh I would just give one more fact
 
06:13:18.510 --> 06:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
because you've gotten so many facts
 
06:13:18.520 --> 06:13:20.430 align:start position:0%
because you've gotten so many facts
today

06:13:20.430 --> 06:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:13:20.440 --> 06:13:22.510 align:start position:0%
today
uh

06:13:22.510 --> 06:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:13:26.070 --> 06:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
China graduates more Engineers I'm
 
06:13:29.190 --> 06:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about the previous Bill China
 
06:13:32.310 --> 06:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
graduates more Engineers each year than
 
06:13:35.910 --> 06:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
the total number of college gradu ues in
 
06:13:38.468 --> 06:13:38.478 align:start position:0%
the United States each
 
06:13:41.150 --> 06:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
year so as you think about this previous
 
06:13:43.990 --> 06:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
Bill uh we need to do more I'm just
 
06:13:46.628 --> 06:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
going to give my uh submit my testimony
 
06:13:48.110 --> 06:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
there are some specifics here on the
 
06:13:49.788 --> 06:13:49.798 align:start position:0%
Holocaust why I think it's important
 
06:13:51.868 --> 06:13:51.878 align:start position:0%
particularly in our society today and
 
06:13:54.190 --> 06:13:54.200 align:start position:0%
also the reference earlier to
 
06:13:57.948 --> 06:13:57.958 align:start position:0%

06:15:04.110 --> 06:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
technology director at Grantham Village
 
06:15:06.230 --> 06:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
School I've been there for 10 years I'm
 
06:15:08.670 --> 06:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
a retired Navy public affairs officer uh
 
06:15:10.390 --> 06:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm here is to stand in
 
06:15:14.150 --> 06:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
opposition of uh HB 283 specifically I'm
 
06:15:15.590 --> 06:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
going to address the computer science
 
06:15:18.310 --> 06:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
and digital literacy item that's been
 
06:15:20.390 --> 06:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
cut uh one of the things that we've
 
06:15:22.708 --> 06:15:22.718 align:start position:0%
talked about at Grandam Village School
 
06:15:26.270 --> 06:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
quite a bit is this notion of digital
 
06:15:28.628 --> 06:15:28.638 align:start position:0%
citizenship okay it's an extension of
 
06:15:30.830 --> 06:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
three things that we talk about every
 
06:15:32.590 --> 06:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
day at the school which is to be safe
 
06:15:35.190 --> 06:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
respectful and responsible and we extend
 
06:15:36.990 --> 06:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
that to being good digital Citizens
 
06:15:39.750 --> 06:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
online also being safe respectful
 
06:15:43.150 --> 06:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
responsible online that um education
 
06:15:45.990 --> 06:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
that we're providing to these kids is
 
06:15:48.628 --> 06:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
crucial for them understanding what
 
06:15:52.430 --> 06:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
their place in the digital world is and
 
06:15:55.270 --> 06:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
what responsibilities they have when
 
06:15:57.990 --> 06:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
they're executing their lives in a in
 
06:16:00.670 --> 06:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
the digital world uh I've been to many
 
06:16:02.468 --> 06:16:02.478 align:start position:0%
of the Christa mcff conferences that
 
06:16:04.150 --> 06:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
they have in Manchester one of the
 
06:16:05.788 --> 06:16:05.798 align:start position:0%
speakers several years years ago was a
 
06:16:09.590 --> 06:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
young lady probably about 14 or so who
 
06:16:14.030 --> 06:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
talked about uh how her Digital Life was
 
06:16:17.830 --> 06:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
not a separate entity it was her it was
 
06:16:21.030 --> 06:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
part of who she was and this is in fact
 
06:16:22.830 --> 06:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
the way that our children these days are
 
06:16:25.788 --> 06:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
living I have a a senior in high school
 
06:16:29.030 --> 06:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
a daughter who's a sophomore at UVM
 
06:16:33.110 --> 06:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
and their Digital Life is their life the
 
06:16:35.030 --> 06:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
notion that you would somehow strike
 
06:16:37.708 --> 06:16:37.718 align:start position:0%
digital literacy as one of the core
 
06:16:40.270 --> 06:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
components of an adequate education is
 
06:16:43.830 --> 06:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
just abhorent to me to understand that
 
06:16:46.390 --> 06:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
you know you're not going to have that
 
06:16:49.190 --> 06:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
be one of the core skills that children
 
06:16:50.590 --> 06:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire are going
 
06:16:53.670 --> 06:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
to have as a critical component of their
 
06:16:57.390 --> 06:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
education is just baffling to to
 
06:17:00.750 --> 06:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
me um the previous bill that was being
 
06:17:02.548 --> 06:17:02.558 align:start position:0%
discussed in here was talked about as
 
06:17:05.190 --> 06:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
stem a lot of times people talk about it
 
06:17:07.468 --> 06:17:07.478 align:start position:0%
as Steam and I'll wrap up Mr chairman
 
06:17:12.070 --> 06:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
just a minute the a in Steam is for Arts
 
06:17:14.990 --> 06:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
that includes things like being creative
 
06:17:17.868 --> 06:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
when you're writing code for example
 
06:17:19.910 --> 06:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's not just a matter of the technology
 
06:17:22.430 --> 06:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's incorporating creativity into
 
06:17:24.670 --> 06:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
that too so I would just reiterate that
 
06:17:29.468 --> 06:17:29.478 align:start position:0%
I oppose HP 283 um and reiterate too I
 
06:17:31.830 --> 06:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
think education is not a zero sum game
 
06:17:33.310 --> 06:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
all of these things that are in here are
 
06:17:35.750 --> 06:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
critical to the entire education of a
 
06:17:37.830 --> 06:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
whole person for a citizen in New
 
06:17:41.070 --> 06:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you thank you
 
06:17:45.270 --> 06:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
Kristen bbau followed by Robert Moore is
 
06:17:47.190 --> 06:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
it possible for a gentleman to go ahead
 
06:17:50.788 --> 06:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
he must pick up his child after school
 
06:17:53.150 --> 06:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
okay mine will be quick
 
06:17:53.160 --> 06:17:54.830 align:start position:0%
okay mine will be quick
too

06:17:54.830 --> 06:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
too
 
06:17:57.910 --> 06:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
what's what's the name the name is Paul
 
06:17:59.788 --> 06:17:59.798 align:start position:0%
bunker thank you very much for hearing
 
06:18:02.350 --> 06:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
me I am a technology professional a
 
06:18:04.590 --> 06:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
musician and have been an educator and
 
06:18:06.948 --> 06:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
I'm I am a citizen of Epsom and I was
 
06:18:08.190 --> 06:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
involved in the school board meeting
 
06:18:09.990 --> 06:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
that was discussed earlier as my fellow
 
06:18:12.190 --> 06:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
towns person has pointed out the
 
06:18:15.310 --> 06:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
consensus was not in support of the
 
06:18:17.230 --> 06:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
ideology behind this
 
06:18:19.990 --> 06:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill I think that it's important for us
 
06:18:24.190 --> 06:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
to remember that we we have children
 
06:18:25.708 --> 06:18:25.718 align:start position:0%
saying the Pledge of Allegiance every
 
06:18:28.190 --> 06:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
day and instead of rehashing my
 
06:18:31.110 --> 06:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
opposition which I've already registered
 
06:18:33.948 --> 06:18:33.958 align:start position:0%
for the board to remember that if we
 
06:18:35.310 --> 06:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
don't teach
 
06:18:36.468 --> 06:18:36.478 align:start position:0%
how do they understand what they're
 
06:18:37.868 --> 06:18:37.878 align:start position:0%
pledging allegiance to and what they
 
06:18:40.070 --> 06:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
should be proud of and if we're not
 
06:18:41.390 --> 06:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
teaching them about the things that have
 
06:18:43.468 --> 06:18:43.478 align:start position:0%
happened in the past or how to prepare
 
06:18:45.750 --> 06:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
for the future in a technologically
 
06:18:49.390 --> 06:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
Centric world how can we expect our
 
06:18:51.750 --> 06:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
society to continue to move
 
06:18:54.628 --> 06:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
forward I had my son ask me one day what
 
06:18:56.670 --> 06:18:56.680 align:start position:0%
a Buffalo Soldier was which eventually
 
06:18:59.070 --> 06:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
led to a discussion about the
 
06:19:00.868 --> 06:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
Emancipation Proclamation in the Civil
 
06:19:03.430 --> 06:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
War this was when he was four years old
 
06:19:05.510 --> 06:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
and these are subjects that
 
06:19:07.548 --> 06:19:07.558 align:start position:0%
children need to understand and if we're
 
06:19:09.670 --> 06:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
not going to teach Civics and I
 
06:19:11.468 --> 06:19:11.478 align:start position:0%
understand that it isn't to not teach
 
06:19:13.708 --> 06:19:13.718 align:start position:0%
these subjects but coming from an area
 
06:19:15.708 --> 06:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
where we won't have the funds and we
 
06:19:18.548 --> 06:19:18.558 align:start position:0%
have a vote on the 11th to raise taxes
 
06:19:20.868 --> 06:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
$289 on every
 
06:19:23.628 --> 06:19:23.638 align:start position:0%
th000 which even before I had kids I was
 
06:19:25.830 --> 06:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
happy to pay the tax increase because I
 
06:19:28.190 --> 06:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
understand that a well-informed populace
 
06:19:32.830 --> 06:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
is the most important part of our
 
06:19:35.830 --> 06:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
society and if we're not going to teach
 
06:19:37.868 --> 06:19:37.878 align:start position:0%
them these things how will they
 
06:19:40.548 --> 06:19:40.558 align:start position:0%
understand it and how will we move
 
06:19:45.948 --> 06:19:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:49.110 --> 06:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
much uh perhaps state representative Dan
 
06:19:51.150 --> 06:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
McGuire means well but I'm opposed to
 
06:19:53.230 --> 06:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
this bill dumbing up education takes
 
06:19:55.590 --> 06:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
even more power away from education it
 
06:19:57.510 --> 06:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
sends a message that education is not
 
06:19:59.468 --> 06:19:59.478 align:start position:0%
that important and I believe that's the
 
06:20:02.468 --> 06:20:02.478 align:start position:0%
Crux of the matter students are seeing
 
06:20:05.150 --> 06:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
aren't seeing the buyin
 
06:20:08.430 --> 06:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
learning we have the power to create to
 
06:20:11.430 --> 06:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
contribute it starts while they're young
 
06:20:13.468 --> 06:20:13.478 align:start position:0%
not when we're older that's the way our
 
06:20:13.478 --> 06:20:16.030 align:start position:0%
not when we're older that's the way our
brains

06:20:16.030 --> 06:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:19.590 --> 06:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
work it's powerful it creates buyin but
 
06:20:22.150 --> 06:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not an art teacher or engineering
 
06:20:24.868 --> 06:20:24.878 align:start position:0%
teacher I was a social studies teacher
 
06:20:27.390 --> 06:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
social sciences and history and I know
 
06:20:30.468 --> 06:20:30.478 align:start position:0%
we know that quote those that have
 
06:20:32.830 --> 06:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
forgotten their history are condemned to
 
06:20:34.948 --> 06:20:34.958 align:start position:0%
repeat it
 
06:20:37.430 --> 06:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
the Holocaust cannot be forgotten even
 
06:20:39.110 --> 06:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
now we are dealing with something
 
06:20:41.510 --> 06:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
similar power to control the populace
 
06:20:44.708 --> 06:20:44.718 align:start position:0%
through media news further this bill
 
06:20:47.788 --> 06:20:47.798 align:start position:0%
requires only eight credits to graduate
 
06:20:50.110 --> 06:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
that's heading for the need of no high
 
06:20:52.590 --> 06:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
school if they don't have to offer it
 
06:20:54.868 --> 06:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
they won't it's true too many school
 
06:20:57.150 --> 06:20:57.160 align:start position:0%
districts are struggling and could see
 
06:20:59.150 --> 06:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
this as a way to keep taxes from
 
06:21:01.948 --> 06:21:01.958 align:start position:0%
climbing you see we must look ahead at
 
06:21:03.948 --> 06:21:03.958 align:start position:0%
what new legislation could pave the way
 
06:21:07.150 --> 06:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
for America's struggling at is is kids
 
06:21:10.190 --> 06:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
need to create invent they need that
 
06:21:12.670 --> 06:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
type of buyin students want to be
 
06:21:15.070 --> 06:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
empowered yes there is an issue but
 
06:21:17.830 --> 06:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
dumbing down ex education will only
 
06:21:20.708 --> 06:21:20.718 align:start position:0%
exerp the issue thank
 
06:21:25.110 --> 06:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much Robert Moore

firsthand the value of an education that

includes World languages art and music
 
06:22:05.390 --> 06:22:05.400 align:start position:0%

06:22:25.030 --> 06:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
importance to dismiss our full historic
 
06:22:28.230 --> 06:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
record is to pave the way for as
 
06:22:30.548 --> 06:22:30.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier for a repeat of
 
06:22:32.750 --> 06:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
history with no lessons
 
06:22:36.110 --> 06:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
learned I am in favor of a complete
 
06:22:39.190 --> 06:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
education including past histories that
 
06:22:42.110 --> 06:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
celebrate our democracy as well as
 
06:22:44.868 --> 06:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
educate the mistakes we've made and
 
06:22:46.030 --> 06:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
learned from
 
06:22:49.070 --> 06:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
these also the importance of learning
 
06:22:51.830 --> 06:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
the Democratic process through a civics
 
06:22:53.830 --> 06:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
class through civic
 
06:22:56.150 --> 06:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
education um instructs a student to
 
06:22:59.628 --> 06:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
become an informed voter how else will a
 
06:23:01.948 --> 06:23:01.958 align:start position:0%
student be prepared to engage in a
 
06:23:04.150 --> 06:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
democracy when it's time for them to
 
06:23:04.160 --> 06:23:05.628 align:start position:0%
democracy when it's time for them to
vote

06:23:05.628 --> 06:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
vote
 
06:23:07.750 --> 06:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
this is why I'm opposed to House Bill

Peace
 
06:23:47.948 --> 06:23:47.958 align:start position:0%
Corps I speak in oppos in opposition to
 
06:23:50.070 --> 06:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
this bill from the vantage point of a
 
06:23:52.948 --> 06:23:52.958 align:start position:0%
foreign language educator I taught
 
06:23:54.868 --> 06:23:54.878 align:start position:0%
Spanish and French for many years in the
 
06:23:57.708 --> 06:23:57.718 align:start position:0%
conquered School District after which I
 
06:24:00.468 --> 06:24:00.478 align:start position:0%
was the entire Spanish department at
 
06:24:02.948 --> 06:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
Colby Sawyer college for a few more
 
06:24:06.868 --> 06:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
years I'm 8 82 years old so over the
 
06:24:08.948 --> 06:24:08.958 align:start position:0%
years I've seen and discussed many
 
06:24:10.990 --> 06:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum changes in our
 
06:24:14.990 --> 06:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
schools when I first read about HB 283 I
 
06:24:17.990 --> 06:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
would I was reminded of the question
 
06:24:20.350 --> 06:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
what do you call someone who speaks
 
06:24:20.360 --> 06:24:21.270 align:start position:0%
what do you call someone who speaks
three

06:24:21.270 --> 06:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
three
 
06:24:24.030 --> 06:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
languages the answer of course
 
06:24:24.040 --> 06:24:26.390 align:start position:0%
languages the answer of course
is

06:24:26.390 --> 06:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:24:28.590 --> 06:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
trilingual and what do you call someone
 
06:24:30.110 --> 06:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
who speaks two
 
06:24:30.120 --> 06:24:32.030 align:start position:0%
who speaks two
languages

06:24:32.030 --> 06:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
languages
 
06:24:34.750 --> 06:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
bilingual how about what do you call
 
06:24:36.590 --> 06:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
someone who speaks one
 
06:24:41.390 --> 06:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:44.670 --> 06:24:44.680 align:start position:0%
American you cannot separate from La uh
 
06:24:47.030 --> 06:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me separate language from culture
 
06:24:50.350 --> 06:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
so learning languages opens our eyes to
 
06:24:53.590 --> 06:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
the world around us we will be depending
 
06:24:55.990 --> 06:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
upon today's young people to navigate an
 
06:24:59.190 --> 06:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
increasingly more complex World studying
 
06:25:01.110 --> 06:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
foreign languages and cultures
 
06:25:02.750 --> 06:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
understanding and assessing new
 
06:25:04.990 --> 06:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
technologies and being grounded in
 
06:25:09.110 --> 06:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
Civics to name a few are essential so
 
06:25:12.670 --> 06:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
please consider what passing this bill
 
06:25:14.670 --> 06:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
might mean for your children and
 
06:25:16.310 --> 06:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
grandchildren thank
 
06:25:18.510 --> 06:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
06:25:21.390 --> 06:25:21.400 align:start position:0%
much is Megan Title
 
06:25:24.670 --> 06:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
Here uh hi Mr chairman uh Brian Hawkins
 
06:25:26.190 --> 06:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
from Nea New Hampshire Megan had to
 
06:25:27.670 --> 06:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
leave I will hand in her written
 
06:25:29.990 --> 06:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
testimony uh but I'll just make a couple
 
06:25:33.350 --> 06:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
of very quick points uh that she raises
 
06:25:35.270 --> 06:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
in there do you have a card
 
06:25:37.350 --> 06:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
um I don't have my card in that Megan
 
06:25:39.350 --> 06:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
has a card in
 
06:25:41.350 --> 06:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
though I'll be brief I give you one
 
06:25:45.030 --> 06:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
minute okay uh I would just urge you to
 
06:25:46.788 --> 06:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
listen to all the Educators who came
 
06:25:49.948 --> 06:25:49.958 align:start position:0%
here today um and the retired
 
06:25:53.948 --> 06:25:53.958 align:start position:0%
Educators uh th uh and from all the
 
06:25:57.390 --> 06:25:57.400 align:start position:0%
stories that we had sent into us um when
 
06:26:00.310 --> 06:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
this bill was published I think the
 
06:26:02.468 --> 06:26:02.478 align:start position:0%
theme that we heard from a lot of them
 
06:26:06.590 --> 06:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
was the all of the confidence some of
 
06:26:08.150 --> 06:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
the intangibles that people have talked
 
06:26:10.788 --> 06:26:10.798 align:start position:0%
about that all of these content areas
 
06:26:14.310 --> 06:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
provided their students today provided
 
06:26:15.910 --> 06:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
them when they were in
 
06:26:17.910 --> 06:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
school those were the things that
 
06:26:20.910 --> 06:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
enabled them to go on and become
 
06:26:24.590 --> 06:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
teachers themselves um and so I would
 
06:26:26.350 --> 06:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
just I'll hand in the testimony but I
 
06:26:28.788 --> 06:26:28.798 align:start position:0%
would just urge you to listen to all the
 
06:26:30.990 --> 06:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
um dedicated professionals who came here
 
06:26:34.350 --> 06:26:34.360 align:start position:0%
today the retired ones who um told you
 
06:26:36.708 --> 06:26:36.718 align:start position:0%
the stories about their students um and
 
06:26:38.270 --> 06:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
their lives so thank you very much Mr
 
06:26:40.750 --> 06:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
chairman please vote against this bill
 
06:26:45.468 --> 06:26:45.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:53.070 --> 06:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:56.270 --> 06:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
Windor good afternoon chair um members
 
06:26:58.628 --> 06:26:58.638 align:start position:0%

and to speak in front of you my name is
 
06:27:03.830 --> 06:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
alvilda jblanco and I'm a resident of
 
06:27:03.840 --> 06:27:05.190 align:start position:0%
alvilda jblanco and I'm a resident of
keen

06:27:05.190 --> 06:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
keen
 
06:27:07.708 --> 06:27:07.718 align:start position:0%
my father lost all of his immediate
 
06:27:10.548 --> 06:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
family in the Holocaust he came to the
 
06:27:14.270 --> 06:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
United States as a student a refugee
 
06:27:16.350 --> 06:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
went to Har um
 
06:27:19.708 --> 06:27:19.718 align:start position:0%
MIT where he graduated with a degree in
 
06:27:19.718 --> 06:27:21.708 align:start position:0%
MIT where he graduated with a degree in
electrical

06:27:21.708 --> 06:27:21.718 align:start position:0%
electrical
 
06:27:25.230 --> 06:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
engineering I was very very happy when
 
06:27:27.310 --> 06:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire became one of the states
 
06:27:30.270 --> 06:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
to add a holocaust and genocide curric
 
06:27:33.190 --> 06:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
um element to its curriculum I think
 
06:27:35.390 --> 06:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
that it's egregious to remove that from
 
06:27:37.830 --> 06:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
its curriculum now and that's just one
 
06:27:37.840 --> 06:27:39.788 align:start position:0%
its curriculum now and that's just one
part

06:27:39.788 --> 06:27:39.798 align:start position:0%
part
 
06:27:43.990 --> 06:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
of the social studies um curriculum
 
06:27:47.190 --> 06:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
which will be gushed to the point of
 
06:27:49.310 --> 06:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
being unrecognizable I don't know what
 
06:27:50.990 --> 06:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to contain if it doesn't
 
06:27:53.548 --> 06:27:53.558 align:start position:0%
contain history Civics geography what
 
06:27:54.548 --> 06:27:54.558 align:start position:0%
what does it
 
06:27:54.558 --> 06:27:56.390 align:start position:0%
what does it
have

06:27:56.390 --> 06:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:27:58.548 --> 06:27:58.558 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to repeat what
 
06:28:00.548 --> 06:28:00.558 align:start position:0%
everybody else said because everybody
 
06:28:02.230 --> 06:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
has said it better than I I'm not an
 
06:28:04.670 --> 06:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
educator but the idea that there is it's
 
06:28:08.270 --> 06:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
a completely false dichotomy to choose
 
06:28:12.510 --> 06:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
English and math over music and computer
 
06:28:15.590 --> 06:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
science it seems self-evident I'm not
 
06:28:17.670 --> 06:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
going to belabor the point when my
 
06:28:20.350 --> 06:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
father was at MIT studying electrical
 
06:28:23.310 --> 06:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
engineering he spent most of his time in
 
06:28:26.230 --> 06:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
the music library listening to music and
 
06:28:28.510 --> 06:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
learning about music these two things
 
06:28:31.430 --> 06:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
for him were inseparable and I think
 
06:28:34.430 --> 06:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
that as everybody has said here today it
 
06:28:37.030 --> 06:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
is fundamental to an education to
 
06:28:40.190 --> 06:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
include all of these subjects so as a
 
06:28:42.350 --> 06:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
resident of keen and citizen of New
 
06:28:47.868 --> 06:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:51.708 --> 06:28:51.718 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much Jane Windsor
 
06:28:57.590 --> 06:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:01.350 --> 06:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
briter hi I am Jane Windsor I'm a
 
06:29:04.150 --> 06:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
retired public school teacher and I live
 
06:29:08.230 --> 06:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
in New Market I'm here today to oppose
 
06:29:12.590 --> 06:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
HB 283 which would remove high priority
 
06:29:14.830 --> 06:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
subjects from the definition of an
 
06:29:18.190 --> 06:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
adequate education in the 21st century
 
06:29:21.190 --> 06:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
most of what I had has already been
 
06:29:23.190 --> 06:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
expressed beautifully so I'll be
 
06:29:27.350 --> 06:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
submitting a hard copy however I do want
 
06:29:30.350 --> 06:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
to speak personally at this time because
 
06:29:33.468 --> 06:29:33.478 align:start position:0%
this part hits me I am the child of
 
06:29:36.468 --> 06:29:36.478 align:start position:0%
Jewish parents whose family was deeply
 
06:29:39.110 --> 06:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
impacted by the Holocaust in all the
 
06:29:42.070 --> 06:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
horrific ways that you can imagine the
 
06:29:45.548 --> 06:29:45.558 align:start position:0%
removal of civics history the Holocaust
 
06:29:49.510 --> 06:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
and genocide education is not just a gap
 
06:29:52.830 --> 06:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
of in knowledge it is
 
06:29:54.830 --> 06:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
dangerous understanding the horrors of
 
06:29:58.628 --> 06:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
the past is crucial in preventing hate
 
06:30:02.070 --> 06:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
and extremism in the future our children
 
06:30:04.510 --> 06:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
must learn to recognize
 
06:30:08.150 --> 06:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
Injustice and stand up for what's right
 
06:30:12.350 --> 06:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
we cannot afford to forget it's our
 
06:30:14.910 --> 06:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
Collective responsibility to preserve
 
06:30:17.548 --> 06:30:17.558 align:start position:0%
the memory of these atrocities the
 
06:30:19.510 --> 06:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
consequences of this bill are not just
 
06:30:21.628 --> 06:30:21.638 align:start position:0%
about cutting costs they are about
 
06:30:24.150 --> 06:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
narrowing our students Futures as we
 
06:30:27.230 --> 06:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
have heard education should ensure all
 
06:30:29.150 --> 06:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students regardless of
 
06:30:31.190 --> 06:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
background have access to the skills and
 
06:30:33.510 --> 06:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge they need to thrive cutting
 
06:30:35.868 --> 06:30:35.878 align:start position:0%
the SI subjects will only deepen the
 
06:30:38.230 --> 06:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
gaps between communities wealthier
 
06:30:40.310 --> 06:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
districts will fill them others will
 
06:30:42.628 --> 06:30:42.638 align:start position:0%
struggle worsening educational
 
06:30:44.910 --> 06:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
inequality we cannot afford to weaken
 
06:30:47.708 --> 06:30:47.718 align:start position:0%
our Public Schools especially when so
 
06:30:50.590 --> 06:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
many families including some of your
 
06:30:54.270 --> 06:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
constituents rely on free public schools
 
06:30:57.030 --> 06:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
as their only educational option I urge
 
06:31:00.230 --> 06:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
you to reject House Bill 283 thank you
 
06:31:02.708 --> 06:31:02.718 align:start position:0%
for your time your patience and
 
06:31:04.430 --> 06:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
consideration thank thank you very much
 
06:31:05.628 --> 06:31:05.638 align:start position:0%
for being
 
06:31:12.350 --> 06:31:12.360 align:start position:0%

06:31:37.350 --> 06:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
06:31:38.990 --> 06:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
06:31:41.548 --> 06:31:41.558 align:start position:0%
in strong opposition of HB 283
 
06:31:43.230 --> 06:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
specifically the provision that removes
 
06:31:44.868 --> 06:31:44.878 align:start position:0%
computer science and digital literacy
 
06:31:46.708 --> 06:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
from the subjects that qualify as an
 
06:31:48.788 --> 06:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
adequate education in New Hampshire my
 
06:31:50.190 --> 06:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
name is Hannah Weissman and I'm the
 
06:31:52.788 --> 06:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
senior director of policy at code.org a
 
06:31:54.628 --> 06:31:54.638 align:start position:0%
national nonprofit dedicated to
 
06:31:57.190 --> 06:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
expanding computer science for all
 
06:32:00.628 --> 06:32:00.638 align:start position:0%
students in 2025 computer science is a
 
06:32:02.830 --> 06:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
critical literacy just like math and
 
06:32:04.310 --> 06:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
reading but it's actually not separate
 
06:32:05.350 --> 06:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
from math and reading there have been
 
06:32:06.830 --> 06:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
studies that have shown that when
 
06:32:08.430 --> 06:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
students take computer science they do
 
06:32:10.430 --> 06:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
better in math and reading and as you
 
06:32:12.310 --> 06:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
can imagine as well math and reading are
 
06:32:13.750 --> 06:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
involved in computer science classes
 
06:32:16.310 --> 06:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
these are not just disperate
 
06:32:18.350 --> 06:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
subjects computer science skills are
 
06:32:20.430 --> 06:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
essential across all Industries um
 
06:32:21.948 --> 06:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
including some key sectors in New
 
06:32:24.270 --> 06:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire such as advanced manufacturing
 
06:32:26.310 --> 06:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
life sciences and technology and
 
06:32:27.990 --> 06:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of students career path
 
06:32:29.628 --> 06:32:29.638 align:start position:0%
computer science teaches students to
 
06:32:32.708 --> 06:32:32.718 align:start position:0%
think creativity um solve problems um
 
06:32:34.270 --> 06:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
which are valuable in any skill their
 
06:32:36.628 --> 06:32:36.638 align:start position:0%
future a student may have removing
 
06:32:37.948 --> 06:32:37.958 align:start position:0%
computer science from New Hampshire's
 
06:32:39.948 --> 06:32:39.958 align:start position:0%
definition of an adequate education
 
06:32:41.230 --> 06:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
would send a message that these skills
 
06:32:44.110 --> 06:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
are optional and they are not New
 
06:32:45.628 --> 06:32:45.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has actually been a leader in
 
06:32:48.270 --> 06:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
computer science education in 2018 the
 
06:32:50.350 --> 06:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
state took a forward forward thinking
 
06:32:52.388 --> 06:32:52.398 align:start position:0%
step by adding computer science to this
 
06:32:54.468 --> 06:32:54.478 align:start position:0%
list of subjects and this policy has
 
06:32:57.030 --> 06:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
resulted in 95% of high schools in New
 
06:32:58.868 --> 06:32:58.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire offering computer science
 
06:33:00.430 --> 06:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
which is one of the highest rates in the
 
06:33:02.788 --> 06:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
country and this progress aligns with
 
06:33:05.788 --> 06:33:05.798 align:start position:0%
national Trends now 33 states require
 
06:33:07.270 --> 06:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
their schools to offer computer science
 
06:33:10.670 --> 06:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
and digital literacy as well if HB 283
 
06:33:13.030 --> 06:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
passes New Hampshire's progress and role
 
06:33:15.270 --> 06:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
as a leader in this country is at risk
 
06:33:17.430 --> 06:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
schools May de deprioritize computer
 
06:33:19.628 --> 06:33:19.638 align:start position:0%
science leading to fewer courses and of
 
06:33:22.430 --> 06:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
course fewer students taking them this
 
06:33:24.628 --> 06:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
would be a backward step at a time when
 
06:33:26.430 --> 06:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
other states are expanding access and
 
06:33:28.628 --> 06:33:28.638 align:start position:0%
investing in their students Futures I
 
06:33:30.590 --> 06:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
urge every member of the education
 
06:33:32.670 --> 06:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
policy and administration committee to
 
06:33:34.230 --> 06:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
support New Hampshire students and
 
06:33:36.270 --> 06:33:36.280 align:start position:0%
econom and economy by rejecting the
 
06:33:37.708 --> 06:33:37.718 align:start position:0%
removal of computer science from the
 
06:33:39.830 --> 06:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
list of adequate subjects this is not
 
06:33:41.868 --> 06:33:41.878 align:start position:0%
just an education policy decision but a
 
06:33:44.150 --> 06:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
Workforce issue New Hampshire has to
 
06:33:45.430 --> 06:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that students are prepared for
 
06:33:47.070 --> 06:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
the modern world and I urge you not to
 
06:33:49.350 --> 06:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
take a step backwards thank you thank

wholehearted opposition to HB 283 I

graduate at the University of New
 
06:34:30.910 --> 06:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the introduction of this bill
 
06:34:32.548 --> 06:34:32.558 align:start position:0%
and the contents within it are extremely
 
06:34:34.150 --> 06:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
concerning and frankly
 
06:34:36.110 --> 06:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
terrifying by cutting these subjects
 
06:34:38.310 --> 06:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
you're leaving behind so many students
 
06:34:40.468 --> 06:34:40.478 align:start position:0%
and please recognize that cutting these
 
06:34:44.030 --> 06:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
requirements is a very slippery
 
06:34:46.468 --> 06:34:46.478 align:start position:0%
slope if you do not invest in our
 
06:34:48.190 --> 06:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
children and provide them with a diverse
 
06:34:50.510 --> 06:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
and enriched education what type of
 
06:34:52.070 --> 06:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
people will they grow up to
 
06:34:54.270 --> 06:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
be how will they navigate an
 
06:34:56.310 --> 06:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
everchanging world and be successful in
 
06:34:58.628 --> 06:34:58.638 align:start position:0%
a chosen profession do you not want them
 
06:34:59.708 --> 06:34:59.718 align:start position:0%
to be fully
 
06:35:01.830 --> 06:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
educated how will the children of New
 
06:35:03.070 --> 06:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire grow up to be successful
 
06:35:05.270 --> 06:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
adults in m MERS of society we if we do
 
06:35:07.388 --> 06:35:07.398 align:start position:0%
not give them the essential tools to do
 
06:35:09.750 --> 06:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
so I understand the concerns that were
 
06:35:11.910 --> 06:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
brought when this this bill was proposed
 
06:35:13.590 --> 06:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
although I Gravely disagree with the
 
06:35:16.628 --> 06:35:16.638 align:start position:0%
bill but this is not the solution this
 
06:35:19.310 --> 06:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
is not the way to correct maybe that the
 
06:35:21.150 --> 06:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
the issues that we're seeing it points
 
06:35:23.468 --> 06:35:23.478 align:start position:0%
to another issue put the funds towards
 
06:35:25.350 --> 06:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
getting these resources towards getting
 
06:35:28.708 --> 06:35:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:30.830 --> 06:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
needed um I want one last thing I wanted
 
06:35:32.548 --> 06:35:32.558 align:start position:0%
to highlight is that I am employed as an
 
06:35:33.910 --> 06:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
engineer in New Hampshire I work in
 
06:35:36.110 --> 06:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
Auburn and when I applied for my first
 
06:35:38.468 --> 06:35:38.478 align:start position:0%
engineering job they looked at the
 
06:35:40.830 --> 06:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
subjects that I took other than math
 
06:35:42.030 --> 06:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
other than
 
06:35:44.070 --> 06:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
engineering they evaluated me as an
 
06:35:45.830 --> 06:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
individual not as a test score even
 
06:35:48.510 --> 06:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
though my GRE scores were
 
06:35:50.590 --> 06:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
average I work for an international
 
06:35:52.150 --> 06:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
company and knowing Spanish has been an
 
06:35:55.230 --> 06:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
asset and an advantage to my career and
 
06:35:56.868 --> 06:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
all of the courses that I took whether
 
06:36:00.110 --> 06:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
they were creativity art related courses
 
06:36:02.110 --> 06:36:02.120 align:start position:0%
or science and engineering those were
 
06:36:04.030 --> 06:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
all looked at when I was looking to
 
06:36:05.468 --> 06:36:05.478 align:start position:0%
become a
 
06:36:07.708 --> 06:36:07.718 align:start position:0%
professional I I'll wrap up right here
 
06:36:09.350 --> 06:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
um additionally these consulting firms
 
06:36:11.590 --> 06:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
which are seeing a huge boom um in
 
06:36:13.468 --> 06:36:13.478 align:start position:0%
growth are looking for creativity in
 
06:36:14.990 --> 06:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
addition to technical Eng engineering
 
06:36:17.708 --> 06:36:17.718 align:start position:0%
skills so I please encourage everyone to
 
06:36:19.590 --> 06:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
really think deep and hard about this
 
06:36:21.788 --> 06:36:21.798 align:start position:0%
before evaluating this bill and please
 
06:36:23.590 --> 06:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
do not approve this as the majority of
 
06:36:25.590 --> 06:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
constituents have stated they do not
 
06:36:28.948 --> 06:36:28.958 align:start position:0%
support this Bill thank you very much is
 
06:36:32.468 --> 06:36:32.478 align:start position:0%

06:36:44.788 --> 06:36:44.798 align:start position:0%
consultant at the State Department of
 
06:36:46.910 --> 06:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
Education I'd like to take a little bit
 
06:36:49.910 --> 06:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
different tact on this and uh pursue
 
06:36:52.670 --> 06:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
some uh policy reasons why I believe
 
06:36:54.628 --> 06:36:54.638 align:start position:0%
this bill is inexpedient to
 
06:36:58.350 --> 06:36:58.360 align:start position:0%
legislate on December 12th 2024 jel car
 
06:37:01.990 --> 06:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
adopted revised Ed 306 minimum standards
 
06:37:04.350 --> 06:37:04.360 align:start position:0%
for public school approval uh the
 
06:37:07.388 --> 06:37:07.398 align:start position:0%
process that went public in May of 2023
 
06:37:10.150 --> 06:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
and required an investment of State time
 
06:37:15.030 --> 06:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
and money uh 8306 rules are uh what the
 
06:37:19.350 --> 06:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
state uses to enact adequate
 
06:37:21.788 --> 06:37:21.798 align:start position:0%
education this bill makes no sense in
 
06:37:24.708 --> 06:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
the context of the newly adopted Ed 306
 
06:37:30.350 --> 06:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
rules ed360 2 definitions begins with a
 
06:37:30.360 --> 06:37:31.590 align:start position:0%
rules ed360 2 definitions begins with a
academic

06:37:31.590 --> 06:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
academic
 
06:37:35.270 --> 06:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
standards it says ademic standards means
 
06:37:39.030 --> 06:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
academic standards as defined in RSA 193
 
06:37:42.270 --> 06:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
E2 D
 
06:37:44.948 --> 06:37:44.958 align:start position:0%
a6b the changes presented in this bill
 
06:37:46.510 --> 06:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
will significantly alter the
 
06:37:48.670 --> 06:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
requirements for public school approval
 
06:37:50.430 --> 06:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
and dilute what all students should know
 
06:37:52.350 --> 06:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
and be able to do as a result of a
 
06:37:55.270 --> 06:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
public education in our state these
 
06:37:57.070 --> 06:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
proposed changes also mean that the
 
06:37:59.708 --> 06:37:59.718 align:start position:0%
state will issue academic standards in
 
06:38:03.510 --> 06:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
the six areas left unscathed by the bill
 
06:38:05.468 --> 06:38:05.478 align:start position:0%
and it will remove any requirement for
 
06:38:07.910 --> 06:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
the lined out areas of study this
 
06:38:10.070 --> 06:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
proposed language is not at all what was
 
06:38:12.990 --> 06:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
addressed and passed by gel car in
 
06:38:15.590 --> 06:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
December it is unclear as to whether
 
06:38:18.388 --> 06:38:18.398 align:start position:0%
this Back to Basics throwback bill has
 
06:38:20.468 --> 06:38:20.478 align:start position:0%
any benefit to our students and
 
06:38:22.948 --> 06:38:22.958 align:start position:0%
Educational Systems what is clear is
 
06:38:24.788 --> 06:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
that this bill falls short in four
 
06:38:27.868 --> 06:38:27.878 align:start position:0%
critical areas number one it undermines
 
06:38:29.830 --> 06:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
our state department of education's core
 
06:38:32.110 --> 06:38:32.120 align:start position:0%
commitment to personalized learning
 
06:38:34.388 --> 06:38:34.398 align:start position:0%
number two it does not not consider the
 
06:38:37.270 --> 06:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
flexibility schools currently have for
 
06:38:39.430 --> 06:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
providing varied learning opportunities
 
06:38:43.510 --> 06:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
for students to meet State expectations
 
06:38:46.548 --> 06:38:46.558 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education number three
 
06:38:48.670 --> 06:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
it does not consider the local control
 
06:38:50.830 --> 06:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
Advantage afforded to our school
 
06:38:52.948 --> 06:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
districts in meeting the state's
 
06:38:55.750 --> 06:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
recently revised minimum standards and
 
06:38:58.310 --> 06:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
number four it set severe limits on
 
06:39:00.788 --> 06:39:00.798 align:start position:0%
public school education risking further
 
06:39:03.070 --> 06:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
disparity between communities and among
 
06:39:05.910 --> 06:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
our student Statewide for access to a
 
06:39:08.830 --> 06:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and robust 21st century
 
06:39:11.788 --> 06:39:11.798 align:start position:0%
education I've uh elucidated on those
 
06:39:14.350 --> 06:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
four points in my written testimony I
 
06:39:16.990 --> 06:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
handed in a copy at the table when I
 
06:39:20.990 --> 06:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
came in thank you so continue to uh read
 
06:39:22.830 --> 06:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
why I think this bill should be
 
06:39:26.190 --> 06:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate thank you
 
06:39:29.150 --> 06:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
Sheila Cunningham
 
06:39:40.468 --> 06:39:40.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:47.830 --> 06:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:51.548 --> 06:39:51.558 align:start position:0%
Trumble hi there uh I come to you as a
 
06:39:54.030 --> 06:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
retired educator I taught here in New
 
06:39:55.910 --> 06:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for
 
06:40:00.110 --> 06:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
38 years and two years in New York state
 
06:40:02.990 --> 06:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
I've taught language arts social studies
 
06:40:05.750 --> 06:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
math Math and Science and one thing I
 
06:40:08.910 --> 06:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
have found out from all of that is that
 
06:40:11.070 --> 06:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
every one of those subjects contains
 
06:40:13.628 --> 06:40:13.638 align:start position:0%
every one of the other subjects that
 
06:40:17.190 --> 06:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
nothing is you know um isolated that
 
06:40:19.830 --> 06:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
there's language arts and math there's
 
06:40:22.670 --> 06:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
math in science and in language arts so
 
06:40:24.990 --> 06:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
that students are getting these core
 
06:40:26.548 --> 06:40:26.558 align:start position:0%
subjects in a lot of different ways that
 
06:40:28.548 --> 06:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
we perhaps don't even
 
06:40:31.190 --> 06:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
consider another thing I want to uh let
 
06:40:33.830 --> 06:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know is that I mean if if one thing
 
06:40:35.150 --> 06:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
I know about everybody in this room is
 
06:40:36.948 --> 06:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
that we we were all young students at
 
06:40:39.270 --> 06:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
one time and think about what you wanted
 
06:40:40.750 --> 06:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
to be when you were a kid when I was an
 
06:40:42.708 --> 06:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
elementary uh Elementary School student
 
06:40:44.070 --> 06:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
I wanted to be a
 
06:40:46.030 --> 06:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
fireman and then when I was in Middle
 
06:40:47.830 --> 06:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
School Mr Pine the guidance counselor
 
06:40:49.430 --> 06:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
asked me what do you want to be when you
 
06:40:52.910 --> 06:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
grow up and I'm like a
 
06:40:56.310 --> 06:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
doctor I didn't become a doctor but what
 
06:40:58.388 --> 06:40:58.398 align:start position:0%
it did was it sent me on a on a course
 
06:41:00.510 --> 06:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
in high school to take the upper echelon
 
06:41:03.388 --> 06:41:03.398 align:start position:0%
classes the the harder classes now I'm
 
06:41:06.510 --> 06:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
came from a very poor background so the
 
06:41:08.150 --> 06:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
comments that I heard earlier about how
 
06:41:11.590 --> 06:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
if you're from a lower economic um
 
06:41:13.270 --> 06:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
status that yeah you're going to bring
 
06:41:15.708 --> 06:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
things down no that actually pushed me
 
06:41:17.628 --> 06:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
pushed me further and one thing I know
 
06:41:19.788 --> 06:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
is that once I got to college I wanted
 
06:41:22.468 --> 06:41:22.478 align:start position:0%
to become a Broadway a
 
06:41:24.548 --> 06:41:24.558 align:start position:0%
director and then about halfway through
 
06:41:26.948 --> 06:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
I changed and I thought what I want want
 
06:41:30.150 --> 06:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
to do I liked English so I became an
 
06:41:32.468 --> 06:41:32.478 align:start position:0%
English teacher I know that the English
 
06:41:34.548 --> 06:41:34.558 align:start position:0%
teacher I became name is because of all
 
06:41:36.430 --> 06:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
the arts classes and everything else
 
06:41:39.350 --> 06:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
that took place in my education prior to
 
06:41:41.590 --> 06:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
my becoming a teacher in fact one thing
 
06:41:42.788 --> 06:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
I learned here because I taught in
 
06:41:45.590 --> 06:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
conquered is that a motto of conquered
 
06:41:47.948 --> 06:41:47.958 align:start position:0%
used to be that what you what what we
 
06:41:50.510 --> 06:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
will be we are now becoming so what
 
06:41:52.110 --> 06:41:52.120 align:start position:0%
students are eventually going to be is
 
06:41:54.510 --> 06:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
dependent on all those classes they take
 
06:41:56.628 --> 06:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
when they're younger including the arts
 
06:41:59.230 --> 06:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
classes one last thing two things two of
 
06:42:00.670 --> 06:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
the greatest lessons I ever learned came
 
06:42:02.430 --> 06:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
from my High School chorus teacher Mr
 
06:42:05.350 --> 06:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
Roberts one he taught me that the only
 
06:42:06.670 --> 06:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
time you ever get sick is when you have
 
06:42:07.948 --> 06:42:07.958 align:start position:0%
time to get sick cuz that was his
 
06:42:09.230 --> 06:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
grandmother she never got sick a day in
 
06:42:10.590 --> 06:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
her life because she didn't have time
 
06:42:12.310 --> 06:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
and two that if you're going to do
 
06:42:14.270 --> 06:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
something do it the absolute best that
 
06:42:17.190 --> 06:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
you can and I I live those two things
 
06:42:19.270 --> 06:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
every single day because of my chorus
 
06:42:21.270 --> 06:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
teacher and yet I became a language arts
 
06:42:23.990 --> 06:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
teacher thank you very much David
 
06:42:28.830 --> 06:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
Trumble followed by Michael
 
06:42:31.030 --> 06:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
betet thank you Mr chairman and
 
06:42:32.868 --> 06:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
committee members it's been a lot of
 
06:42:34.510 --> 06:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
test testimony I'm going to try and get
 
06:42:38.150 --> 06:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
to a couple points first is this list of
 
06:42:40.510 --> 06:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
11 subjects is not just a random list
 
06:42:42.548 --> 06:42:42.558 align:start position:0%
that you can check check the ones you
 
06:42:43.788 --> 06:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
want and get rid of the ones you don't
 
06:42:47.070 --> 06:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
want it's a constitutionally based list
 
06:42:49.190 --> 06:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's required you've heard people
 
06:42:51.628 --> 06:42:51.638 align:start position:0%
mention the Constitution it says the
 
06:42:54.030 --> 06:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
words Arts and Science and commerce and
 
06:42:56.510 --> 06:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
trade then the Claremont decision came
 
06:42:58.430 --> 06:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
along and then that decision the court
 
06:43:00.468 --> 06:43:00.478 align:start position:0%
specifically said we have to train our
 
06:43:02.468 --> 06:43:02.478 align:start position:0%
children for the social economic
 
06:43:04.910 --> 06:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
scientific technological and political
 
06:43:07.230 --> 06:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
realities of today's society they need a
 
06:43:09.948 --> 06:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
grounding in the Arts they need cultural
 
06:43:11.948 --> 06:43:11.958 align:start position:0%
and historical Heritage and they need
 
06:43:13.910 --> 06:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
training in academic and Vocational
 
06:43:16.190 --> 06:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
skills so they can compete favorably in
 
06:43:19.190 --> 06:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
the job market then the London Dairy
 
06:43:21.990 --> 06:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
case came along in 2007 because it was
 
06:43:23.388 --> 06:43:23.398 align:start position:0%
the question or what is inadequate
 
06:43:25.590 --> 06:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
education the court said you have to
 
06:43:27.548 --> 06:43:27.558 align:start position:0%
tell us what it is legislature so the
 
06:43:29.430 --> 06:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
Democrats and Republicans together with
 
06:43:32.468 --> 06:43:32.478 align:start position:0%
the help from the public wrote 193e it
 
06:43:34.590 --> 06:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
was a joint effort and they took pride
 
06:43:36.150 --> 06:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
in their work because they believed in
 
06:43:38.150 --> 06:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
the value of public education at that
 
06:43:39.708 --> 06:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
time and that's where they came up with
 
06:43:41.868 --> 06:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
this list it's not something you can cut
 
06:43:43.868 --> 06:43:43.878 align:start position:0%
things out of it's required by our
 
06:43:45.708 --> 06:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
Constitution and why did the Supreme
 
06:43:47.310 --> 06:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
Court say we have to do this because
 
06:43:49.310 --> 06:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
it's good for the kids it's good for our
 
06:43:51.030 --> 06:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
communities and it's good for our state
 
06:43:52.750 --> 06:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
as a whole they were smart enough to
 
06:43:54.350 --> 06:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
realize that all of these courses are
 
06:43:56.070 --> 06:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
important not just for some children it
 
06:43:58.070 --> 06:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
might be the thing that pulls them into
 
06:44:00.230 --> 06:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
school it can lead to their career you
 
06:44:02.350 --> 06:44:02.360 align:start position:0%
heard talk about other careers
 
06:44:04.150 --> 06:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
specifically from one thing but that all
 
06:44:06.190 --> 06:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
of these subjects are interrelated it's
 
06:44:08.948 --> 06:44:08.958 align:start position:0%
a whole person that we're educating not
 
06:44:11.150 --> 06:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
just a specific course here and there
 
06:44:13.388 --> 06:44:13.398 align:start position:0%
this is a constitutionally required list
 
06:44:15.150 --> 06:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
and you can't just chop it with this
 
06:44:16.270 --> 06:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
Bill thank
 
06:44:19.430 --> 06:44:19.440 align:start position:0%

powerful testimony tonight so I won't U
 
06:44:29.310 --> 06:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
repeat a lot of what has been offered to
 
06:44:30.830 --> 06:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
you tonight my name is Michael bassette
 
06:44:31.990 --> 06:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'm the assistant superintendent of the
 
06:44:33.548 --> 06:44:33.558 align:start position:0%

will um tell you that I my testimony I
 
06:44:37.590 --> 06:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
provided a copy to you but um some
 
06:44:39.190 --> 06:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
points that I didn't hear tonight um
 
06:44:40.990 --> 06:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
first of all I'm going to tell you that
 
06:44:42.910 --> 06:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of this bill wow look at
 
06:44:44.590 --> 06:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
the shock on your faces actually I'm
 
06:44:46.350 --> 06:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
only in favor of this bill if you want
 
06:44:50.110 --> 06:44:50.120 align:start position:0%
to move towards a total totalitarian ISM
 
06:44:52.468 --> 06:44:52.478 align:start position:0%
type Society I truly believe this right
 
06:44:54.788 --> 06:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
now so no I really don't believe in this
 
06:44:57.510 --> 06:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
bill right why because totalitarian
 
06:44:59.190 --> 06:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
governments justify the suppression of
 
06:45:01.388 --> 06:45:01.398 align:start position:0%
Arts by emphasizing economic Pro
 
06:45:04.350 --> 06:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
productivity militarization ID
 
06:45:06.910 --> 06:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
ideological Purity um let's talk about
 
06:45:08.548 --> 06:45:08.558 align:start position:0%
some of the cultures that have done that
 
06:45:11.388 --> 06:45:11.398 align:start position:0%
Nazi Germany for example emphasize the
 
06:45:13.350 --> 06:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
importance of modernist anomic Guard art
 
06:45:15.510 --> 06:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
being labeled as degenerate and removing
 
06:45:17.350 --> 06:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
it from the education system Soviet
 
06:45:19.388 --> 06:45:19.398 align:start position:0%
Union art was strictly controlled under
 
06:45:21.270 --> 06:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
the Socialist regime limiting expression
 
06:45:24.388 --> 06:45:24.398 align:start position:0%
to approved political themes ma China
 
06:45:26.510 --> 06:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
the the cultural revolution saw the
 
06:45:28.230 --> 06:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
destruction of artistic and intellectual
 
06:45:31.388 --> 06:45:31.398 align:start position:0%
Works North Korea I could go on and on
 
06:45:33.310 --> 06:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
but let's talk about it from its reality
 
06:45:34.510 --> 06:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
we are doing this because we don't want
 
06:45:35.868 --> 06:45:35.878 align:start position:0%
to pay for it because some people don't
 
06:45:38.468 --> 06:45:38.478 align:start position:0%
think it has value that's it it really
 
06:45:39.990 --> 06:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
comes down to the fact that people in
 
06:45:41.548 --> 06:45:41.558 align:start position:0%
our communities differ have differing
 
06:45:43.270 --> 06:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
opinions about the value but I can tell
 
06:45:45.070 --> 06:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
you this as a New York state teacher of
 
06:45:47.910 --> 06:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
the year who taught um and I when I was
 
06:45:49.590 --> 06:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
there as a science teacher there was a
 
06:45:51.230 --> 06:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
chemist that spoke earlier to this
 
06:45:54.590 --> 06:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
concept and I have never in my lifetime
 
06:45:56.750 --> 06:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
had more impact on my ability to teach
 
06:45:58.590 --> 06:45:58.600 align:start position:0%
than when I recognize the beauty of art
 
06:46:00.628 --> 06:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
and its influence on things such as
 
06:46:03.070 --> 06:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
crystallization forms or uh for for
 
06:46:05.070 --> 06:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
example the languages that were being
 
06:46:07.590 --> 06:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
spoken in Greek or Latin which were
 
06:46:09.110 --> 06:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
becoming beautiful elements of the
 
06:46:10.628 --> 06:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
language of science when I was talking
 
06:46:12.548 --> 06:46:12.558 align:start position:0%
with kids about the language connections
 
06:46:13.628 --> 06:46:13.638 align:start position:0%
that were being taught in other
 
06:46:15.590 --> 06:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
classrooms so I implore you please
 
06:46:16.990 --> 06:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
please please take a look at what
 
06:46:18.510 --> 06:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
they're tell telling you is a cost
 
06:46:20.468 --> 06:46:20.478 align:start position:0%
savings measure and really look at the
 
06:46:22.468 --> 06:46:22.478 align:start position:0%
fundamental element that's at play
 
06:46:25.590 --> 06:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
because this is just
 
06:46:27.430 --> 06:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
propaganda thank
 
06:46:31.310 --> 06:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
you Taylor Brown followed
 
06:46:34.270 --> 06:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
by Hugh
 
06:46:37.150 --> 06:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
curly uh hi my name is Taylor bevon uh
 
06:46:39.388 --> 06:46:39.398 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time I'm here to
 
06:46:42.868 --> 06:46:42.878 align:start position:0%
oppose uh HB 283 I believe it was
 
06:46:45.110 --> 06:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler wheeler who
 
06:46:46.788 --> 06:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned Conan high school and Jeffrey
 
06:46:49.110 --> 06:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
as an underfunded High School I can tell
 
06:46:50.670 --> 06:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
you firstand it's it's underfunded
 
06:46:52.430 --> 06:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's where I went and
 
06:46:54.190 --> 06:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
there's also been a mention by the
 
06:46:56.910 --> 06:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill that school boards
 
06:46:58.750 --> 06:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
aren't being forced to cut these
 
06:47:01.350 --> 06:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
programs but that uh they're not being
 
06:47:03.310 --> 06:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
required to promote them but I can tell
 
06:47:05.510 --> 06:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
you from my time at uh Conan high school
 
06:47:07.628 --> 06:47:07.638 align:start position:0%
that the first thing they'll do is cut
 
06:47:09.868 --> 06:47:09.878 align:start position:0%
these uh the best class I took at that
 
06:47:12.708 --> 06:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
school was a class taught by uh Spanish
 
06:47:15.510 --> 06:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
teacher actually teaching genocidal
 
06:47:18.270 --> 06:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
studies about uh the Holocaust and other
 
06:47:21.910 --> 06:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
genocides this class was extremely
 
06:47:24.110 --> 06:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
important in developing my critical
 
06:47:26.190 --> 06:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
thinking skills and my knowledge and
 
06:47:27.230 --> 06:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
understanding of the world and I think
 
06:47:29.708 --> 06:47:29.718 align:start position:0%
those are really the points of Education
 
06:47:31.788 --> 06:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
in general especially public education
 
06:47:34.868 --> 06:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
it's a responsibility to emphasize those
 
06:47:36.590 --> 06:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
critical thinking skills because the
 
06:47:38.990 --> 06:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
reality is in K through 12 you cannot
 
06:47:41.030 --> 06:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
give everybody the answers to every
 
06:47:42.430 --> 06:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
problems but you can give them the tools
 
06:47:45.868 --> 06:47:45.878 align:start position:0%
to solve those problems I think that uh
 
06:47:48.948 --> 06:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
HB 283 misunderstands the purpose of
 
06:47:50.990 --> 06:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
education and I think it misses the mark
 
06:47:53.190 --> 06:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
on trying to solve the problems that
 
06:47:56.430 --> 06:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
schools teachers and students are facing
 
06:47:58.948 --> 06:47:58.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much for
 
06:48:05.910 --> 06:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:11.670 --> 06:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:16.070 --> 06:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
minty followed by John Hall or Jonah
 
06:48:19.830 --> 06:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
Hall hello my name is Joe Mundy um thank
 
06:48:22.150 --> 06:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
you for hearing me today I'll just uh
 
06:48:23.270 --> 06:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
try to make a couple points that I
 
06:48:24.590 --> 06:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
actually don't think have been made I am
 
06:48:27.070 --> 06:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
here to voice my opposition uh for this
 
06:48:29.430 --> 06:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
bill I um I was I'm the past president
 
06:48:30.948 --> 06:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire music educators
 
06:48:33.510 --> 06:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
Association I'm also the K3 12
 
06:48:35.230 --> 06:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
Performing Arts director for the Salem
 
06:48:37.030 --> 06:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
School District uh representing the
 
06:48:38.990 --> 06:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
whole District in all music and theater
 
06:48:41.350 --> 06:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
activities um and the thing that I just
 
06:48:43.910 --> 06:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
like to point out about uh in this case
 
06:48:46.388 --> 06:48:46.398 align:start position:0%
Arts education specifically is um the
 
06:48:48.230 --> 06:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
value in it you know when we think about
 
06:48:50.070 --> 06:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
what our students need to be successful
 
06:48:51.910 --> 06:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
what any of us in this world have needed
 
06:48:53.910 --> 06:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
to be successful I'm going to stick with
 
06:48:55.350 --> 06:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
my argument that I don't think
 
06:48:56.948 --> 06:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
content-based knowledge is really where
 
06:48:58.468 --> 06:48:58.478 align:start position:0%
we're at anymore we all have a little
 
06:49:00.030 --> 06:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
tool in our pocket right now that can
 
06:49:02.150 --> 06:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
find the answer to any question we have
 
06:49:03.270 --> 06:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
um so when we think think about where
 
06:49:04.830 --> 06:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
success comes from it's about other
 
06:49:06.548 --> 06:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
skills and that's where I would argue
 
06:49:08.350 --> 06:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is falling short it's getting
 
06:49:09.868 --> 06:49:09.878 align:start position:0%
rid of subject areas that are going to
 
06:49:11.270 --> 06:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
develop all these other skills that are
 
06:49:13.270 --> 06:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
truly the skills that allow us to be
 
06:49:14.830 --> 06:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
successful in life so I'm thinking about
 
06:49:17.708 --> 06:49:17.718 align:start position:0%
things like perseverance a sense of
 
06:49:20.070 --> 06:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
self-worth self-discipline and a work
 
06:49:22.270 --> 06:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
ethic a sense of belonging and value in
 
06:49:24.388 --> 06:49:24.398 align:start position:0%
the eyes of others creativity and
 
06:49:27.868 --> 06:49:27.878 align:start position:0%
flexible thinking resilience Logic the
 
06:49:30.670 --> 06:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
development of motor skills um authentic
 
06:49:32.708 --> 06:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
high stakes performance experiences and
 
06:49:34.990 --> 06:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
front of live audiences emotional
 
06:49:37.310 --> 06:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
maturity um understanding of one's role
 
06:49:39.190 --> 06:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
within a group and working with others
 
06:49:41.190 --> 06:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
collaboratively patience critical
 
06:49:42.990 --> 06:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
thinking and those are the skills we
 
06:49:44.990 --> 06:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
develop with all these other areas that
 
06:49:47.670 --> 06:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh this bill proposes to cut so um
 
06:49:49.310 --> 06:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
that's it you know in the end I think
 
06:49:50.670 --> 06:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
when you think about what success comes
 
06:49:52.230 --> 06:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
from and what allows all of us adults to
 
06:49:54.468 --> 06:49:54.478 align:start position:0%
be successful in this world it's all
 
06:49:56.708 --> 06:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
these other things and by you know uh
 
06:49:58.230 --> 06:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill I think we'd just
 
06:50:00.230 --> 06:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
be missing the point entirely on what
 
06:50:02.388 --> 06:50:02.398 align:start position:0%
allows us to be successful so please uh
 
06:50:03.708 --> 06:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill and thank you for your
 
06:50:05.788 --> 06:50:05.798 align:start position:0%
time today thank you very
 
06:50:09.270 --> 06:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
much Mr Hall yes my name is John Hall
 
06:50:11.830 --> 06:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
from Amherst New Hampshire and I speak
 
06:50:14.910 --> 06:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
in opposition to Bill H
 
06:50:18.230 --> 06:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
283 uh I would like to point out that
 
06:50:21.628 --> 06:50:21.638 align:start position:0%
grade school K through 12 is really the
 
06:50:24.708 --> 06:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
last chance for structured formal
 
06:50:28.030 --> 06:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
education in for all of our students
 
06:50:29.788 --> 06:50:29.798 align:start position:0%
some students may be lucky enough to go
 
06:50:31.990 --> 06:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
on to University and receive extra
 
06:50:34.548 --> 06:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
education but this is really the last
 
06:50:37.030 --> 06:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
time that a majority of our students
 
06:50:39.948 --> 06:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
will get a formal education i' like to
 
06:50:42.708 --> 06:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
speak about world languages I'm one of
 
06:50:44.788 --> 06:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
those Americans who can only speak
 
06:50:47.270 --> 06:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
English I did take two years of French
 
06:50:49.788 --> 06:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
and two years of Latin in grade school
 
06:50:52.430 --> 06:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
but I forgotten a lot of that however I
 
06:50:55.070 --> 06:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of my time today in Latin
 
06:50:58.468 --> 06:50:58.478 align:start position:0%
America I wish I'd studied Spanish which
 
06:51:00.590 --> 06:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
is the second most spoken native
 
06:51:02.350 --> 06:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
language in the world with mandarin
 
06:51:05.110 --> 06:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
being being first I think in modern day
 
06:51:06.948 --> 06:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
world maybe we should spend some more
 
06:51:08.670 --> 06:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
time learning these
 
06:51:12.030 --> 06:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
languages students in grade school don't
 
06:51:13.750 --> 06:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
know all the things that they will need
 
06:51:16.868 --> 06:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
to know in the future it up to us the
 
06:51:20.030 --> 06:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
adults in the room to help them
 
06:51:22.548 --> 06:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
understand what they have to learn and
 
06:51:24.468 --> 06:51:24.478 align:start position:0%
finally I'd like to put in a little plug
 
06:51:27.628 --> 06:51:27.638 align:start position:0%
for uh Financial personal
 
06:51:30.990 --> 06:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
financial about 70% of the bankruptcies
 
06:51:33.150 --> 06:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
in the United States today come from
 
06:51:34.590 --> 06:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
06:51:36.948 --> 06:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
underinsured people who don't understand
 
06:51:40.190 --> 06:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
how Insurance Works my first job out of
 
06:51:42.910 --> 06:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
college was for an insurance company but
 
06:51:45.708 --> 06:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
I was a programmer but they made us
 
06:51:48.788 --> 06:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
spend two weeks of understanding
 
06:51:51.590 --> 06:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
Insurance what deductibles are what we
 
06:51:55.788 --> 06:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
need to cover our needs credit card fees
 
06:51:59.430 --> 06:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
are astronomically large at one time I
 
06:52:02.548 --> 06:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
was in personal debt up above my ear
 
06:52:04.590 --> 06:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
years but because my knowledge of
 
06:52:07.430 --> 06:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
personal finance I was able to refinance
 
06:52:09.948 --> 06:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
my house on the second mortgage and get
 
06:52:14.310 --> 06:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
out of that that structure thank you
 
06:52:17.788 --> 06:52:17.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much perfect timing is
 
06:52:23.070 --> 06:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:36.190 --> 06:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:39.708 --> 06:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um I'm assuming everyone
 
06:52:43.868 --> 06:52:43.878 align:start position:0%
who has been in this room today had the
 
06:52:45.868 --> 06:52:45.878 align:start position:0%
privilege of the
 
06:52:48.990 --> 06:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
standards of an American
 
06:52:51.788 --> 06:52:51.798 align:start position:0%
Education my husband and I moved to New
 
06:52:55.788 --> 06:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 1979 with no children we
 
06:53:00.030 --> 06:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
did not object to paying School tax
 
06:53:03.990 --> 06:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
because I think that every child is
 
06:53:04.000 --> 06:53:05.830 align:start position:0%
because I think that every child is
everyone's

06:53:05.830 --> 06:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
everyone's
 
06:53:09.270 --> 06:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility I see no reason and do
 
06:53:09.280 --> 06:53:11.150 align:start position:0%
responsibility I see no reason and do
not

06:53:11.150 --> 06:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:53:15.310 --> 06:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
understand why anyone would lower the
 
06:53:17.628 --> 06:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
standards of the
 
06:53:20.948 --> 06:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
many rather than raise the standards of
 
06:53:20.958 --> 06:53:21.830 align:start position:0%
many rather than raise the standards of
the

06:53:21.830 --> 06:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:53:25.590 --> 06:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
few for a private education which is
 
06:53:30.270 --> 06:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
expensive our free education was for the
 
06:53:32.670 --> 06:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
underprivileged and the privileged
 
06:53:35.948 --> 06:53:35.958 align:start position:0%
please vote against this Bill thank you
 
06:53:38.070 --> 06:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
06:53:41.230 --> 06:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
much Michaela and then uh Amelia

06:53:55.708 --> 06:53:55.718 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire school funding
 
06:53:58.150 --> 06:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
fairness project today I speak only for
 
06:54:01.110 --> 06:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
myself though my 14-year-old autistic
 
06:54:03.230 --> 06:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
son he's a freshman at over High School
 
06:54:05.430 --> 06:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
his name is Harrison he's great for the
 
06:54:07.510 --> 06:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
first time in his life he's thriving in
 
06:54:09.788 --> 06:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
school this year he's taking a mixture
 
06:54:12.430 --> 06:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
of core academic classes like language
 
06:54:14.830 --> 06:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
arts Math and Science as well as the
 
06:54:17.388 --> 06:54:17.398 align:start position:0%
classes he loves the most band intro to
 
06:54:20.430 --> 06:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
Arts musical theater he's a proud member
 
06:54:22.628 --> 06:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
of the Dober High School marching band
 
06:54:24.468 --> 06:54:24.478 align:start position:0%
and at this very moment he's in a
 
06:54:26.350 --> 06:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
rehearsal for the March production of
 
06:54:29.350 --> 06:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
bye-bye birdie representative Maguire
 
06:54:31.468 --> 06:54:31.478 align:start position:0%
stated the removal of these courses
 
06:54:33.590 --> 06:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
would allow for more time to be spent on
 
06:54:35.750 --> 06:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
core classes with the goal of raising
 
06:54:38.350 --> 06:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
standardized test scores but Research
 
06:54:39.910 --> 06:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
indicates students who take music
 
06:54:42.388 --> 06:54:42.398 align:start position:0%
courses score higher on the SATs
 
06:54:44.548 --> 06:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
especially in verbal and math they
 
06:54:46.990 --> 06:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
receive more academic honors and awards
 
06:54:49.030 --> 06:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
and they score higher on standardized
 
06:54:51.948 --> 06:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
tests than their non-banded peers a
 
06:54:53.788 --> 06:54:53.798 align:start position:0%
study done in the British Columbia
 
06:54:55.590 --> 06:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
reported in American Psychological
 
06:54:57.430 --> 06:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
Association and published in the Journal
 
06:55:00.150 --> 06:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
of educational psychology reads and I
 
06:55:03.150 --> 06:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
quote it is believed that students who
 
06:55:05.910 --> 06:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
spend school time in music classes
 
06:55:07.910 --> 06:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
rather than in furthering developing
 
06:55:09.830 --> 06:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
their skills in math science and English
 
06:55:12.230 --> 06:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
classes will underperform in these
 
06:55:15.030 --> 06:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
disciplines our research suggests that
 
06:55:17.708 --> 06:55:17.718 align:start position:0%
in fact the more they study music the
 
06:55:20.388 --> 06:55:20.398 align:start position:0%
better they do in those subjects the
 
06:55:22.030 --> 06:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
American Council on the teaching of
 
06:55:24.110 --> 06:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
foreign languages reports that students
 
06:55:26.388 --> 06:55:26.398 align:start position:0%
who study foreign languages tend to
 
06:55:28.948 --> 06:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
achieve higher scores on the Act and the
 
06:55:32.388 --> 06:55:32.398 align:start position:0%
SAT particularly in the verbal sections
 
06:55:34.270 --> 06:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire stated and I
 
06:55:36.590 --> 06:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
quote this bill has zero to do with
 
06:55:39.590 --> 06:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
State funding end quote in fact it has
 
06:55:41.948 --> 06:55:41.958 align:start position:0%
everything to do with State funding the
 
06:55:43.788 --> 06:55:43.798 align:start position:0%
state has spent the last five years and
 
06:55:46.350 --> 06:55:46.360 align:start position:0%
millions of taxpayer dollars on outof
 
06:55:48.750 --> 06:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
state attorneys in the conval and Rand
 
06:55:51.350 --> 06:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuits to argue for the narrowest
 
06:55:53.150 --> 06:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
possible definition of an adequate
 
06:55:55.708 --> 06:55:55.718 align:start position:0%
education comprised of only the 11
 
06:55:57.830 --> 06:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
subjects laid out in the statute
 
06:55:59.388 --> 06:55:59.398 align:start position:0%
reducing required courses would
 
06:56:01.430 --> 06:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately reduce what the state must
 
06:56:03.868 --> 06:56:03.878 align:start position:0%
pay for my final comment is
 
06:56:05.990 --> 06:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire stated and I
 
06:56:08.070 --> 06:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
quote would you rather be able to do
 
06:56:09.990 --> 06:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
math and deal with numbers at a higher
 
06:56:11.548 --> 06:56:11.558 align:start position:0%
level or learn
 
06:56:14.230 --> 06:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
French why then would the prime sponsor
 
06:56:16.510 --> 06:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
think that eliminating personal finance
 
06:56:19.230 --> 06:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
literacy is a good idea learning about
 
06:56:21.670 --> 06:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
student loan repayment compound interest
 
06:56:23.788 --> 06:56:23.798 align:start position:0%
household budgeting these are the life
 
06:56:25.468 --> 06:56:25.478 align:start position:0%
skills New Hampshire graduates need that
 
06:56:27.030 --> 06:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
will carry them confidently and
 
06:56:29.430 --> 06:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
successfully through life please itl
 
06:56:32.628 --> 06:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you very much thank you
 
06:56:35.430 --> 06:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
is Amilia Thompson
 
06:56:41.030 --> 06:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:44.388 --> 06:56:44.398 align:start position:0%
Soul good to meet you all oh my name is
 
06:56:46.590 --> 06:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
Amelia and I'm a constituent from New
 
06:56:49.350 --> 06:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
Market New Hampshire I'm here because
 
06:56:53.310 --> 06:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
the core learning areas of the Arts and
 
06:56:55.750 --> 06:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
Civics and language have brought me to
 
06:56:58.030 --> 06:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
where I am today and built me up and so
 
06:56:59.948 --> 06:56:59.958 align:start position:0%
have the teachers that taught those
 
06:57:02.708 --> 06:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
things I don't want to kick the L out
 
06:57:04.830 --> 06:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
from under me and I don't think anyone
 
06:57:07.990 --> 06:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
in this room wants to either so I
 
06:57:10.670 --> 06:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose this bill and I think
 
06:57:13.910 --> 06:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to think of students as
 
06:57:17.510 --> 06:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
human beings and not just test takers
 
06:57:20.750 --> 06:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
not just like a drain on our taxes or
 
06:57:23.270 --> 06:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
financial resources they're human beings
 
06:57:26.150 --> 06:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
and deserving of support and I think
 
06:57:28.270 --> 06:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
that we need to work together and find a
 
06:57:31.230 --> 06:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
way to be able to fund that support this
 
06:57:34.270 --> 06:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
bill is not not that funding not this
 
06:57:37.350 --> 06:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
bill is not the answer taking away
 
06:57:40.750 --> 06:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
funding for these core classes of the
 
06:57:44.788 --> 06:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
Arts language Civics all of these things
 
06:57:46.990 --> 06:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
is not the right answer thank you for
 
06:57:47.000 --> 06:57:47.868 align:start position:0%

Wyman hi everybody I'm Emily soul and
 
06:58:03.388 --> 06:58:03.398 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to oppose House Bill 200
 
06:58:06.070 --> 06:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
83 I was born down the street at
 
06:58:08.388 --> 06:58:08.398 align:start position:0%
conquered Hospital 25 years ago I
 
06:58:10.628 --> 06:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
attended marac Valley high school and a
 
06:58:12.110 --> 06:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
new which is a New Hampshire public
 
06:58:13.670 --> 06:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
school and I was on conquered highs
 
06:58:15.948 --> 06:58:15.958 align:start position:0%
robotics team the year we went to World
 
06:58:17.910 --> 06:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
Championships when it came time to go to
 
06:58:19.708 --> 06:58:19.718 align:start position:0%
college I chose the University of New
 
06:58:21.708 --> 06:58:21.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I was asked to come back
 
06:58:23.270 --> 06:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
for my Master's Degree which I just
 
06:58:25.750 --> 06:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
completed this summer what did I study
 
06:58:28.510 --> 06:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
you ask economics political science
 
06:58:31.070 --> 06:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
pre-law communication and ultimately
 
06:58:32.708 --> 06:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
public policy
 
06:58:34.270 --> 06:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
the only reason that I was able to do
 
06:58:36.030 --> 06:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
any of that is because of the hard work
 
06:58:38.670 --> 06:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
of my teachers and the law that forces
 
06:58:41.910 --> 06:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
schools to provide those classes for
 
06:58:44.190 --> 06:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
me everybody else has made a lot of the
 
06:58:46.070 --> 06:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
points I wanted to make so instead of
 
06:58:47.788 --> 06:58:47.798 align:start position:0%
that I would like to focus on what this
 
06:58:51.110 --> 06:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
would do to our society we interact with
 
06:58:53.030 --> 06:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
each other every single day every time
 
06:58:54.628 --> 06:58:54.638 align:start position:0%
you go out of the house you talk to
 
06:58:56.910 --> 06:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
people who used to be students this
 
06:58:59.110 --> 06:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
isn't about what your tax dollars do or
 
06:59:01.388 --> 06:59:01.398 align:start position:0%
don't do for somebody else's kid or if
 
06:59:03.150 --> 06:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
you ever meet that person it's about the
 
06:59:05.150 --> 06:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
fact that when you go to the grocery
 
06:59:06.830 --> 06:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
store the person who is stocking the
 
06:59:08.350 --> 06:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
shelves who is bagging your groceries
 
06:59:10.070 --> 06:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
and who is working that cash register
 
06:59:12.910 --> 06:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
for you was a student here it's about
 
06:59:14.590 --> 06:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that when you are old and in a
 
06:59:16.388 --> 06:59:16.398 align:start position:0%
nursing home the people who are caring
 
06:59:18.590 --> 06:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
for you and keeping you alive do you
 
06:59:20.830 --> 06:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
want those people to be well educated or
 
06:59:23.510 --> 06:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
not when you go to a meeting like this
 
06:59:24.868 --> 06:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
do you want people to have intelligent
 
06:59:26.750 --> 06:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
things to say do you want the Democracy
 
06:59:27.990 --> 06:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we have in the state of New
 
06:59:31.070 --> 06:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that flame to carry on or do
 
06:59:32.788 --> 06:59:32.798 align:start position:0%
you want this Hall to be empty
 
06:59:34.310 --> 06:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
do you want nobody to know where to go
 
06:59:35.510 --> 06:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
or how to
 
06:59:37.910 --> 06:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
talk I am who I am because of the
 
06:59:39.430 --> 06:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
education I received and the teachers
 
06:59:42.110 --> 06:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
that gave it to me I would be lost I
 
06:59:43.708 --> 06:59:43.718 align:start position:0%
would be desolate and I would be Hollow
 
06:59:45.830 --> 06:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
and empty if I didn't have the economics
 
06:59:47.190 --> 06:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
classes and the political science
 
06:59:48.590 --> 06:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
classes that brought me to the
 
06:59:50.868 --> 06:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
conclusions that I've come to in my
 
06:59:54.388 --> 06:59:54.398 align:start position:0%
life oppose this bill determine that it
 
06:59:57.670 --> 06:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
is inexpedient to legislate and protect
 
07:00:00.468 --> 07:00:00.478 align:start position:0%
the future adults and fellow people that
 
07:00:02.868 --> 07:00:02.878 align:start position:0%

here yes I'm Teresa Wyman and I am here
 
07:00:13.830 --> 07:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
partly because a young woman about
 
07:00:17.310 --> 07:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
aelia's age called me this weekend and
 
07:00:20.468 --> 07:00:20.478 align:start position:0%

and she and the teachers in her school
 
07:00:30.590 --> 07:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
are very upset that this this um hearing
 
07:00:32.910 --> 07:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
was scheduled during school hours so
 
07:00:35.388 --> 07:00:35.398 align:start position:0%
none of them are able to
 
07:00:38.430 --> 07:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
come and she is somebody who believe me
 
07:00:40.750 --> 07:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
has worked hard for her
 
07:00:44.788 --> 07:00:44.798 align:start position:0%
education for myself I find this entire
 
07:00:48.150 --> 07:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
Bill appalling I could speak to every
 
07:00:50.910 --> 07:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
subject that is proposed to be gotten
 
07:00:50.920 --> 07:00:51.830 align:start position:0%
subject that is proposed to be gotten
rid

07:00:51.830 --> 07:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
rid
 
07:00:54.910 --> 07:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
of because I'm an amateur musician I'm
 
07:00:56.948 --> 07:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
just going to address music it's already
 
07:01:00.270 --> 07:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
been addressed but there are documented
 
07:01:04.310 --> 07:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
studies that music helps improves math
 
07:01:06.670 --> 07:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
it improves overall learning and memory
 
07:01:10.190 --> 07:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
improves mental health happiness and
 
07:01:13.110 --> 07:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
well-being I want to add to that music
 
07:01:16.750 --> 07:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
promotes community and Community is so
 
07:01:19.388 --> 07:01:19.398 align:start position:0%
important in our world in our fractured
 
07:01:19.398 --> 07:01:20.670 align:start position:0%
important in our world in our fractured
world

07:01:20.670 --> 07:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
world
 
07:01:24.310 --> 07:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
today and to quote someone who is a
 
07:01:26.990 --> 07:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
semi-professional musician which I am
 
07:01:29.750 --> 07:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
not music will take you where money
 
07:01:33.548 --> 07:01:33.558 align:start position:0%
won't if money is so important
 
07:01:37.030 --> 07:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
than let's look at our music can can do
 
07:01:41.230 --> 07:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
I've been some amazing places because of
 
07:01:44.910 --> 07:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
music I also in the moment I might have
 
07:01:47.430 --> 07:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
left want to speak to the Holocaust my
 
07:01:49.868 --> 07:01:49.878 align:start position:0%
dad wrote books about the
 
07:01:53.110 --> 07:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
Holocaust anti-Semitism is up
 
07:01:55.510 --> 07:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
360% in this country in the last year
 
07:01:57.628 --> 07:01:57.638 align:start position:0%
according to the Anti-Defamation
 
07:02:00.868 --> 07:02:00.878 align:start position:0%
League and my last comment is I believe
 
07:02:03.350 --> 07:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
this is the camel's in the tent to try
 
07:02:05.868 --> 07:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
to get rid of decent education and I
 
07:02:09.468 --> 07:02:09.478 align:start position:0%
abore that idea I haven't had lunch yet
 
07:02:11.388 --> 07:02:11.398 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure I have a parking ticket
 
07:02:13.670 --> 07:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's how passionate I feel about
 
07:02:19.948 --> 07:02:19.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:24.070 --> 07:02:24.080 align:start position:0%

three
 
07:03:10.510 --> 07:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
decades I think the key component that
 
07:03:14.230 --> 07:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
our sponsor may be neglecting is what
 
07:03:18.150 --> 07:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
happens after your bill is passed what
 
07:03:22.110 --> 07:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
happens when all the new criteria have
 
07:03:24.388 --> 07:03:24.398 align:start position:0%
been completed and high school students
 
07:03:27.350 --> 07:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
are graduates after two years of high
 
07:03:30.548 --> 07:03:30.558 align:start position:0%
school what do we do with 16year olds
 
07:03:33.868 --> 07:03:33.878 align:start position:0%

07:03:39.750 --> 07:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
16 it could be a very complex ugly
 
07:03:41.590 --> 07:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
animal that we create as a result of
 
07:03:41.600 --> 07:03:42.910 align:start position:0%
animal that we create as a result of
this

07:03:42.910 --> 07:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:03:46.788 --> 07:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
legislation um and my second comment

qualifications that our students would
 
07:05:09.990 --> 07:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
need to be able to apply to
 
07:05:13.750 --> 07:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
colleges well colleges also look to see
 
07:05:15.430 --> 07:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
that students are coming from accredited
 
07:05:19.070 --> 07:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
high schools and these the curriculum
 
07:05:22.388 --> 07:05:22.398 align:start position:0%
that this bill proposes takes away some
 
07:05:25.910 --> 07:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the requirements for accreditation um
 
07:05:30.030 --> 07:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry I'm been out of uh that
 
07:05:32.590 --> 07:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
system for a while so but certainly uh
 
07:05:37.230 --> 07:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
World languages certainly um probably uh
 
07:05:40.788 --> 07:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
personal finance Civics um having a good
 
07:05:43.510 --> 07:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
library and so forth um the second thing
 
07:05:46.270 --> 07:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
I wanted to point out is that having had
 
07:05:48.388 --> 07:05:48.398 align:start position:0%
a lot of time in schools and teaching
 
07:05:49.788 --> 07:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
students who weren't always very
 
07:05:52.750 --> 07:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about my math classes um
 
07:05:55.350 --> 07:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
kids need to have a reason to be in
 
07:05:58.110 --> 07:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
school they love to have something that
 
07:06:01.830 --> 07:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
inspires them it can be a shop class can
 
07:06:04.910 --> 07:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
be um playing sports and so therefore
 
07:06:06.350 --> 07:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
they want to do well in their English
 
07:06:08.788 --> 07:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
class so that they can pass but they
 
07:06:11.990 --> 07:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
need something that motivates them and
 
07:06:14.510 --> 07:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
so all the courses that are offered are
 
07:06:16.670 --> 07:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
important for that the second thing is
 
07:06:19.030 --> 07:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
is that through those courses they get
 
07:06:21.110 --> 07:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities that they might not have
 
07:06:23.868 --> 07:06:23.878 align:start position:0%
otherwise foreign language classes take
 
07:06:27.030 --> 07:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
kids on trips and the last thing I want
 
07:06:29.430 --> 07:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
to say is that people have already said
 
07:06:34.070 --> 07:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
but um I'm part of the grain population
 
07:06:36.110 --> 07:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and I would like to
 
07:06:38.708 --> 07:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
know that we are educating people who
 
07:06:40.788 --> 07:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
are going to be able to take care of us
 
07:06:44.230 --> 07:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much is Kathy
 
07:06:44.240 --> 07:06:47.310 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much is Kathy

07:07:05.110 --> 07:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
homeown homeowner and conquered I'm also
 
07:07:06.430 --> 07:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
an associate Dean at Southern New
 
07:07:08.070 --> 07:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire University although I am here
 
07:07:10.110 --> 07:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
today speaking on behalf of my myself I
 
07:07:12.868 --> 07:07:12.878 align:start position:0%
do not represent the school I hav't hard
 
07:07:14.628 --> 07:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
a discussion of AI here today and I
 
07:07:16.590 --> 07:07:16.600 align:start position:0%
think that that's relevant too in
 
07:07:20.670 --> 07:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
today's world being able to recite facts
 
07:07:22.910 --> 07:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't get you very far you need
 
07:07:25.628 --> 07:07:25.638 align:start position:0%
critical thinking you need analysis you
 
07:07:27.230 --> 07:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
need to be able to contextualize things
 
07:07:28.788 --> 07:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
that are happening in terms of our
 
07:07:31.110 --> 07:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
historical and political world you can't
 
07:07:32.910 --> 07:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
do that without these
 
07:07:36.070 --> 07:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
subjects I also question what makes
 
07:07:38.830 --> 07:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
these subjects like history and
 
07:07:38.840 --> 07:07:40.548 align:start position:0%
these subjects like history and
geography

07:07:40.548 --> 07:07:40.558 align:start position:0%
geography
 
07:07:43.270 --> 07:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
extras how can people engage in
 
07:07:46.430 --> 07:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
political discourse vote Voice opinions
 
07:07:48.948 --> 07:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
on International politics if they don't
 
07:07:52.868 --> 07:07:52.878 align:start position:0%
even know where Russia China or Mexico
 
07:07:55.590 --> 07:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
are education is part of what drives
 
07:07:58.150 --> 07:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
people to live in the state I have the
 
07:08:01.150 --> 07:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
resources and I will move if the quality
 
07:08:04.230 --> 07:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
of education in the state goes down what
 
07:08:06.468 --> 07:08:06.478 align:start position:0%
happens to our school budgets when
 
07:08:09.270 --> 07:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
people who can afford to move
 
07:08:11.948 --> 07:08:11.958 align:start position:0%
do my parents did not graduate from
 
07:08:15.310 --> 07:08:15.320 align:start position:0%
college we sometimes literally did not
 
07:08:17.590 --> 07:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
have enough money to keep the lights
 
07:08:21.190 --> 07:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
on I would not be where I am today if I
 
07:08:24.910 --> 07:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
did not get the classes the access to
 
07:08:26.990 --> 07:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
college that I got because of the
 
07:08:29.708 --> 07:08:29.718 align:start position:0%
education I got at a small town in New
 
07:08:32.388 --> 07:08:32.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where I can almost guarantee
 
07:08:35.670 --> 07:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
these courses would have been cut if
 
07:08:39.430 --> 07:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
they had that option it feels to me like
 
07:08:41.590 --> 07:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this bill feels like
 
07:08:42.990 --> 07:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
children that live in those less
 
07:08:46.708 --> 07:08:46.718 align:start position:0%
affluent towns the child that I was was
 
07:08:48.868 --> 07:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
less entitled to a quality
 
07:08:51.350 --> 07:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
education I know that students on
 
07:08:53.948 --> 07:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch typically don't do as well
 
07:08:56.430 --> 07:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
in school that's because students who
 
07:08:58.830 --> 07:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
are worried about being safe and having
 
07:09:01.788 --> 07:09:01.798 align:start position:0%
enough food to eat don't usually have as
 
07:09:04.990 --> 07:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
much time to study I argue the solution
 
07:09:06.628 --> 07:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
is not that we do less for those
 
07:09:09.830 --> 07:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
students but that we do more thank you
 
07:09:12.910 --> 07:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much is Mary Beth
 
07:09:12.920 --> 07:09:16.948 align:start position:0%

Finley hi Jack Finley
 
07:09:35.430 --> 07:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to um let people know
 
07:09:36.628 --> 07:09:36.638 align:start position:0%
because I I wasn't planning on coming
 
07:09:38.468 --> 07:09:38.478 align:start position:0%
here today but when he was introducing
 
07:09:40.388 --> 07:09:40.398 align:start position:0%
his bill I was the superintendent of
 
07:09:42.310 --> 07:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
Epsom I am the superintendent of Epsom
 
07:09:44.310 --> 07:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
that he referenced um and the intent of
 
07:09:46.110 --> 07:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
that meeting with representative Maguire
 
07:09:47.750 --> 07:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
was to advocate for additional State
 
07:09:49.948 --> 07:09:49.958 align:start position:0%
education funding not to maintain
 
07:09:51.388 --> 07:09:51.398 align:start position:0%
minimal funding and diminish the quality
 
07:09:52.948 --> 07:09:52.958 align:start position:0%
of Education in New Hampshire I just
 
07:09:53.990 --> 07:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that people didn't
 
07:09:55.070 --> 07:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
jump to the conclusion that I was
 
07:09:57.070 --> 07:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
supporting this so that was the original
 
07:09:58.230 --> 07:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
intent behind the meeting was to
 
07:10:00.430 --> 07:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
advocate for additional State funding so
 
07:10:01.948 --> 07:10:01.958 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify to make sure
 
07:10:03.868 --> 07:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
everybody's I know I only said 30
 
07:10:05.948 --> 07:10:05.958 align:start position:0%
seconds so I think I get it thank you
 
07:10:07.868 --> 07:10:07.878 align:start position:0%
very much thank
 
07:10:14.468 --> 07:10:14.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:17.150 --> 07:10:17.160 align:start position:0%

junior high as a middle school teacher
 
07:10:29.548 --> 07:10:29.558 align:start position:0%
one thing that I want to point out I'm
 
07:10:31.030 --> 07:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
so proud of all the people that came and
 
07:10:33.270 --> 07:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
spoke spoken opposition of this bill I
 
07:10:36.070 --> 07:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
myself am opposed to this bill as well
 
07:10:37.590 --> 07:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
what hasn't been mentioned is there was
 
07:10:39.548 --> 07:10:39.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned about Civics education and the
 
07:10:42.270 --> 07:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
recent adoption of a civic's requirement
 
07:10:44.990 --> 07:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
in high school but in 2022 there was
 
07:10:47.788 --> 07:10:47.798 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1671 which made personal
 
07:10:49.830 --> 07:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
finance a core academic subject in
 
07:10:52.708 --> 07:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
public schools that covers the topics
 
07:10:54.468 --> 07:10:54.478 align:start position:0%
such as employment income money
 
07:10:57.868 --> 07:10:57.878 align:start position:0%
management credit debit debt management
 
07:10:59.990 --> 07:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
planning savings and
 
07:11:03.388 --> 07:11:03.398 align:start position:0%
investing one of the PE I want to also
 
07:11:06.270 --> 07:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
mention that uh representative lad
 
07:11:08.468 --> 07:11:08.478 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli representative B
 
07:11:10.590 --> 07:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
representative Allard representative
 
07:11:13.750 --> 07:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
Moffett and uh Senator Reagan were in
 
07:11:16.468 --> 07:11:16.478 align:start position:0%
support of this partisan
 
07:11:20.030 --> 07:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
bill um and here we are um I also want
 
07:11:23.468 --> 07:11:23.478 align:start position:0%
to mention that the Ed 306s are we often
 
07:11:26.590 --> 07:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
call them in education the minimum uh
 
07:11:29.270 --> 07:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards for public school
 
07:11:31.590 --> 07:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
approval this would make a I don't know
 
07:11:33.150 --> 07:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
what this bill would be called but maybe
 
07:11:35.030 --> 07:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
it would be the minimum substandards for
 
07:11:37.150 --> 07:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
minimum Public School approval I don't
 
07:11:40.388 --> 07:11:40.398 align:start position:0%
know what we also argued that it wasn't
 
07:11:42.788 --> 07:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
they weren't in fact the Ed 306s minimum
 
07:11:45.270 --> 07:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
standards but they were what we believe
 
07:11:48.030 --> 07:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
to be an adequate education inv voided
 
07:11:50.788 --> 07:11:50.798 align:start position:0%
we want more and I talk to students high
 
07:11:53.030 --> 07:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
school students across the state and I
 
07:11:55.270 --> 07:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
talk to them every day in various high
 
07:11:57.910 --> 07:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
schools across this across the state of
 
07:11:59.948 --> 07:11:59.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and they're all concerned
 
07:12:02.310 --> 07:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
about big things they're concerned about
 
07:12:03.948 --> 07:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
how they're going to afford things
 
07:12:06.110 --> 07:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
they're concerned about climate they're
 
07:12:07.510 --> 07:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about their what their world's
 
07:12:09.430 --> 07:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
going to be whether or not they'll be
 
07:12:11.670 --> 07:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
employable what's going to happen to
 
07:12:14.190 --> 07:12:14.200 align:start position:0%
their families um they're worried about
 
07:12:16.310 --> 07:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
big things and we ask why aren't they
 
07:12:18.948 --> 07:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
learning math and Ela and from a nape
 
07:12:20.708 --> 07:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
score there are so many other
 
07:12:22.590 --> 07:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
distractions similar to bills like this
 
07:12:24.230 --> 07:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
that take us away of what our jobs are
 
07:12:27.310 --> 07:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
in public education that it really hurts
 
07:12:30.510 --> 07:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
our kids um I also want to mention that
