unity um I'm in my fourth term on the
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
education committee and three out of
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
those four
 
00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
terms uh actually um I received when I
 
00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
while I was working on the education
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
committee I received the annotated
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
education laws um for each bium uh last
 
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
last term uh we did not receive those
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
laws and I had requested of course it
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
was a unusual by any of because it was
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
cut short um but I requested those laws
 
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
several times the booklet um I find it
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
very helpful I'm not a lawyer um I'm a
 
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
former school teacher and um
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
it's very important for me um
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
particularly at my age I guess also that
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
I have something in writing that I can
 
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
kind of look at and go through and um I
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
found the annotated version of the law
 
00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
uh very important and very informative
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
because it told me about the Amendments
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
and it told me about court cases and
 
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing so I I found it very
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
important um I don't know if the house
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
fairy just showed up all of a sudden um
 
00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
before this bill came up on the on the
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
table but voila yesterday um big cartons
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
rolled into our um secretary's office
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
and um we were handed the new annotated
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
versions which is what I requested in
 
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
this bill um I think the bill is still
 
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
important even though you may think
 
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
because you got the booklets that it's
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
kind of a moot case um I think that um
 
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
so much in the
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
past I don't know four years five years
 
00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
uh we we've
 
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
seen what is usual and customary
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
procedure what is common courtesy um
 
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
Unwritten rules um just kind of Fall by
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
the wayside and and uh it's been a real
 
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
wakeup call when you say Really they can
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
do that um and this is one of those
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
things that um I think has been a
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
courtesy thing it's never been in
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
statute before so I think it's important
 
00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
that we go through this law this bill um
 
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
I've handed out a a an amendment to the
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
bill because I realized that um you know
 
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
even though I'm over the hill there's a
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
lot of young people coming up thankfully
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
and they use portable storage devices
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
thumb drives or flash drives as as you
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
see and certainly it's more cost
 
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
effective to um the people that are
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
doing this um and talking about cost
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness when I got my bill back
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
and it had an FN on it and it was uh I
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
looked at it and the first thing that
 
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
jumped out of at me was the $10,000 and
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
I thought that's like $400 a book I
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
don't I didn't really think a paperback
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
book uh even how big they were was going
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
to be $400 so I did call the Department
 
00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
of Education um attorney Fenton uh
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
talked me down off the 10,000 and and uh
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
uh assured me that it didn't cost $400 a
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
book and um we had a a quite a good
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
conversation about it the other part of
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
this bill or the amendment is that I
 
00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
also talked to a couple of
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
superintendant uh in my area about how
 
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
they found out how they were able to
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
access rsas on education and the changes
 
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.790 align:start position:0%
access rsas on education and the changes
on

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
education um and if they had to have a
 
00:11:17.069 --> 00:11:17.079 align:start position:0%
quick look up how they did that and of
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
course they have you know lawyers that
 
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
they can call um school districts do but
 
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they try to do that as little
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
as possible knowing how much an hour uh
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
they probably get charged but they one
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
superintendent said Gee I you know a few
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
years back I remember that they used to
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
send us flash drives and or the thumb
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
drives or the portable storage devices
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
um so I in the amendment I I uh put in
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
there that um the uh representative or
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
senator may request uh you know in
 
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
either format and that um the
 
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent receive a flash drive of
 
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
the new uh annotated laws at the
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
beginning of the bium
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's important we're all
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
working from the same place so that's my
 
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chairman are you
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
aware also that um the book is what we
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
really need because we can't use our
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
laptops and whatnot while we're at
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
hearing so it's hard to look up with a
 
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
thumb drive um yeah I I think that's
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
probably true um I you know the thing
 
00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:32.839 align:start position:0%
about uh looking up uh I know the
 
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
website has been improved and and it's
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
got the laws on it um they're just not
 
00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:57.829 align:start position:0%
got the laws on it um they're just not
annotated

00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
yes uh and with my discussion with
 
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton who's here in attendance
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
this morning thank you for coming um we
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
discussed the the um possibility um and
 
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
the good probability that we could
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
actually get a a print out of the new
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
rsas at the end of the first year of the
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
bium um as they apply to education
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
because that's that's the other thing
 
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
the book is you know a two-year book and
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh we do have changes after the first
 
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
bium or the first year of the bium um
 
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
and she said that that would be readily
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
available is that correct um and my
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
other my other thought um on this bill
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
was about the uh education rules um
 
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
which have still confused me about um
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
you know exactly I'm not exactly sure
 
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
how all those turn around and come back
 
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
to us but um certainly there are
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
education rules that I would like to
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
have uh the ability to look up easily
 
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
and I find the Department of Education
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
website although it's beautiful um is
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes very difficult for me to
 
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
navigate and it again it may be my age
 
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
but um I've heard it from some other
 
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
people that they've had a little
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
difficulty finding laws and rules as
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
they're made up so uh certainly if we
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
could get a flash drive um portable
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
storage device um for the rules the
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
education rules um or at least the
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
changes the current changes I think that
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:45.470 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't put my red button on my
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
phone which is what I use to access all
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
of that stuff I would love to put the
 
00:15:57.069 --> 00:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
the book in my phone so that because
 
00:15:59.790 --> 00:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
it's annotated right and that way and do
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
you so my question is do you in your
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
conversation have any idea when they'll
 
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
get us that thumb drive uh no but I
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
think after I finish that uh you can ask
 
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton to come up and and she
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
evidently has the answers to to some of
 
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
them or at least knows where to get them
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
um I think the other the other issue is
 
00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:22.839 align:start position:0%
that uh I remember you know the old
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
books like you chairman lad talked about
 
00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
yesterday were about three times the
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
size of the one that you today for the
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
new people and um Jim Grenier used to
 
00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:35.959 align:start position:0%
bring his book every day and he had like
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
I bet you a h hundred of little tabs on
 
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
it where different different laws were
 
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
um and I really appreciated at that time
 
00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
I I think it was maybe the second term
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
on the education committee um attorney
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
Fenton actually came with an index of
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
here's where these things are that we're
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about a lot of things
 
00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
for Education are and it was very inform
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
ative so perhaps you can ask her if
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
she'd be willing to do a little um index
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
for us as well thank you thank you very
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
much would you believe that I have back
 
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
to 2008 with those little sticky notes
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
all through it yellow marks all through
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
it pencil and it that is where I go back
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
to reference especially the annotated
 
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839 align:start position:0%
versions to find out the history of when
 
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
these things occurred that's right
 
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
that's very important it's very
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
important our next speaker is from the
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
Department yes represent
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.350 align:start position:0%
Department yes represent
Hall

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
Hall
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I just have a
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
question about um
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative taner about the portable
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
data storage device and I'm wondering if
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
um possibly when it says provide a
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
physical copy and if it just said
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
electronic copy repr Hall can you move
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
that mic a little bit closer to your
 
00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
speech I'm just wondering about
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
electronic copy I'm just thinking down
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
the road flash drives people don't even
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
use them you know or they might not use
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
them they use them now and if you just
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
left an electronic that it could be wide
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
open to whatever technolog is available
 
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
next year or the it doesn't really
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
change the intent right of the U I think
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's um thank you for the the question
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
I think that the portable data storage
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
devices uh is kind of um when when I
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
went to OS I asked for a flash drive and
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
this is what they came up with and I
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
think uh they were trying to cover some
 
00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
of those bases as well but um certainly
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
in in the future I think we can you know
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
if it becomes a problem um and one of
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
the two of us is around then I think we
 
00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:35.799 align:start position:0%
can offer another amendment okay thank
 
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Woodcock thank you Mr
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
chairman represent tan thank you uh for
 
00:18:43.149 --> 00:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward uh just a quick
 
00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:44.919 align:start position:0%
question when uh chiny fent and walked
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
you off the cliff did she give you a
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
ballpark estimate what the cost of it um
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
yes uh she did uh she said uh about $105
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
per book um I'm not sure if that was the
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
huge one or the or the
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh annotated the the the vision that we
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
have is the the big books had all kinds
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
of laws about uh camps and about the
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire how it was run I
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
mean they were they were referenced
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
across with education but they really
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
were ancillary so um this I think is a
 
00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
more condensed version um of the of the
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
book it certainly isn't like I said the
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
three three stories high um and uh as
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know a true attorney she kind of
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
couched it with you know prices go up
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
all the
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
time thank you repres thank you chman
 
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh one more
 
00:19:41.549 --> 00:19:41.559 align:start position:0%
represent Cornell I don't know if it's
 
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
it's really a question but I know a lot
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
of the newer people to the committee
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
aren't here and I don't know have has
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
there been an orientation so they
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
actually know what we're talking about
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
and what the book
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
is generally speaking in response to
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
that um when we uh have our first
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
meeting as an education committee at the
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
beginning of the bium we have in the
 
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
past had these materials or at least had
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
them within a month or two afterwards
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
and when they are they're handed out
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
these books came back to us I saw them
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
on the desk in here but we didn't have
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
any hearings or exec sessions this last
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
summer so they sat there uh I believe I
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
did mention it somewhere along the way
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
to some groups of folks that came in on
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
either on other uh committees or
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
commissions and said we have these books
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
upstairs in the administrator go take
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
one uh but they weren't going to mail
 
00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
these things out to us U no I I was
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
totally unaware they were available or
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
even like I said I thought it was just
 
00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:42.039 align:start position:0%
the house Fury that showed up with them
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
the other day no no they they have been
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
available and I did make it known to
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
when we were looking at CTE when we were
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
looking at the school building uh deal
 
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
where the infrastruct funds that built
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
to support what you know that
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
legislation we did mention they upstairs
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
however um the only way of getting them
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
would be to drive in and get that book
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
and it's it's there's a lot of issues
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
with this whole thing you know because I
 
00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:10.039 align:start position:0%
know that I bought a thumb drive the
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
other day for my insurance company they
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
want to see what the inside of my house
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
looked like for the homeowner policy I
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
got a thumb drive came home and I
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't put the thumb drive in my
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
computer so it's then I I have to send
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
it all by phone or whatever so it our
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
technology is changing so rapidly um
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
your your whole intent here is wonderful
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
and we've got to look figure out how to
 
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
make it work so we become familiar with
 
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
what's what we're doing and what we have
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
done in the past so if there's no more
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
questions for the sponsor the bill right
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
now we can invite Diana up and um hear
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
from the Department what their plan is
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
to make this thing
 
00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
y representative Tanner I would testify
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
with my book
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's really important to have props
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
right so good morning for the record my
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
name is Diana Fenton I'm an attorney
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education it's
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
nice to see everyone um so there is a
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
long standing history with the book when
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
I began uh with the Department back in
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
2015 it was quite thick and voluminous
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
um the joke I always made was the reason
 
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
I did criminal law before education was
 
00:22:28.269 --> 00:22:28.279 align:start position:0%
that we had a thinner book um but if you
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
looked through that book there were
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
Provisions that were just not necessary
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
there was a provision on homicide there
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
were provisions on camps it just wasn't
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily relevant so my co-counsel
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
and I at the department recently went
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
through and we called out what was not
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
necessary and um we call well we're
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
lawyers so we use fancy terms like we
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
call one book The Big Book and the other
 
00:22:54.269 --> 00:22:54.279 align:start position:0%
book the little book and I hope those
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
terms are easily accessible and
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
translatable um but this is what happens
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
when two lawyers hang out together so we
 
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
have the big book and the little book
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
the little book costs uh $105 to publish
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
as representative Tanner testified
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
to not only will the price go up and I
 
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
think that's expected across the board
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
but more importantly we're not sure if
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
the publisher will continue to publish
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
the book it is not profitable for the
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
publisher and that is outside of of our
 
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
control so that is a caveat that I
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with this committee um
 
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
however I will be the first to say and I
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
told this representative Tanner I
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
understand the need and the desire to
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
have the book uh no one uses their book
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
more than I do so I can certainly um
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
agree with that as for the rules
 
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
um the rules are a little trickier and
 
00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons is not only do we
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
have so many rules as is evident by our
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
website but my concern in publishing
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
them we can publish them as a state
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
agency we have uh a publishing I don't
 
00:23:57.149 --> 00:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
know if it's a company but it's a statun
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
organization that does all the
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
publishing um it's the reason you have
 
00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
all the bills printed here that is a
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
state agency we can work with them to
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
publish it however when it comes to our
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
rules I think it's important to realize
 
00:24:10.669 --> 00:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
that each set of rules has a different
 
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
expiration date so my concern about
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
publishing them as one volume is that
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
every section is going to be run its
 
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
course at a different time one thing we
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
did do uh in the past which you're
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
probably familiar with is we did publish
 
00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:30.039 align:start position:0%
in print the code of conduct which was
 
00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:33.799 align:start position:0%
passed by this committee um back in 2017
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
I believe and the reason we did that is
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
because it directly affects Educators
 
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
credentials we did not want it to just
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
be on our website as another link so we
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
have actively publish those books we
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
also publish um actively publish the
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
special ed rules every time that those
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
are done so rules are done on a 10e
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
cycle um I think the possibility the
 
00:24:59.389 --> 00:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
more feasible possibility because the
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
$10,000 that really comes from the
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
anticipatory uh cost of the rules the
 
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
books are a lesser cost at
 
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
$105 but I think one possible solution
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
is to pick an area uh whether it's CTE
 
00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
or credentialing or minimum standards
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
and have those rules
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
published I that's how I think that
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
feasible I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
I have I have a question first um when
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
we had a bill a little while ago dealing
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
with uh personal finance
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
literacy that is in the rules it's not
 
00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
statute so in order for us to know when
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
we're preparing legislation or hearing
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
from folks in the field we'd like or
 
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
from the business people that want
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
financial literacy we have to go down
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
and Chase down and get on the web now
 
00:25:58.029 --> 00:25:58.039 align:start position:0%
and and look for that area within in
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
rule making my concern is that the last
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
time IED the rules and I always carry
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
the rules with me but I I can't recall
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
how many years ago when we had the issue
 
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
where the rules weren't we there was a
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
new change came forward in
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
306 and the new rules could not go into
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
effect seeing that um we we it had
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
missed that 10-year de uh date for
 
00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:28.039 align:start position:0%
Renewal and so we flipped back the old
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
ones but the new rules were already
 
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
printed in the book and so then we had
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
to reprint saying no you go back to the
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
prior year rules that was back I think
 
00:26:39.149 --> 00:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
when you either came on board or Aaron
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
was still here or there how can we get
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
these rules annually like we used to or
 
00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:48.919 align:start position:0%
by anually for our committee we used to
 
00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
get a book which which the rules went
 
00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
especially 306 which is the most
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
important ones uh dealing with the
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
approv approval of public school
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
education how can we get a copy that
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
provided to us each bium a hard
 
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
copy those can be published as I
 
00:27:11.789 --> 00:27:11.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned um so I a couple of things
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
that I want to just unpack from uh the
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
the question and thank you for the
 
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
question um the department cannot engage
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
in rule making without statutory
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
authority to do so and that's 541a so
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
anytime you see a statute that said that
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
says rulle making it will have the
 
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
associated statutory number so it
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
surprises me that there are rules
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
without that statutory Authority that
 
00:27:38.909 --> 00:27:38.919 align:start position:0%
should not exist um however more to the
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
point if the committee requests that we
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
publish a certain section of the rules
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
minimum standards School approval I I
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
think that is feasible to do but there
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
will be an Associated cost and again in
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note we came up with that
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
amount of $10,000 just based upon the
 
00:28:00.269 --> 00:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
have just in response to that
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
followup it was very informative for us
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
to have that book if we could open it up
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
and figure out where we were and in fact
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
that that part I just spoke to dealt
 
00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:16.039 align:start position:0%
with the required courses that had to be
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
taken for graduation in high school and
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
it was listed under the social studies
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
where you had economics and some of the
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
other and it then it went into personal
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
finance it was not in statute that's one
 
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
of the reason why we brought forward
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
legislation to put fin personal finance
 
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
literacy into statute which I don't
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
believe we have done yet and U so so I I
 
00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:41.519 align:start position:0%
think we all need a copy that when we
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
start out and work here because
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we are referencing Rule and
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
we don't have anything that's there for
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
us to look at other than getting on the
 
00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:52.519 align:start position:0%
web and then we're searching where to
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
find it on the web which is oftentimes
 
00:28:57.389 --> 00:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
difficult and and I I do not dis
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
disagree at all I love paper copies and
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
books myself um the testimony from the
 
00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
Department is simply to be mindful that
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
we will
 
00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:09.799 align:start position:0%
need the the monetary support in order
 
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
to print those those copies so the
 
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
Department's happy to provide that
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
information but it will certainly come
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
at a cost but we can work with the state
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
publisher and and provide those books of
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
rules they're very helpful to have and
 
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
it is the law um so I can certainly
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
understand why the committee would want
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
that information we have to be mindful
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
that there has to be that fiscal cost
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
associated with that okay I can allow
 
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
others to have some questions here
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
representative yes Mary
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
Beth thank you I have two unrelated
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
questions but let me start with the
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
first we know that the state has
 
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
publishing facilities on store Street if
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh Thompson reuter stops publishing this
 
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
can we just get the state to publish
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
it it's possible I don't want to speak
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
for the publishing um the state
 
00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
publishing group because they I
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
I'm hesitant to speak for them but is
 
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
that a possibility yes and I appreciate
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
that idea okay my second one is I think
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
I'm the only other lawyer sitting at
 
00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
this table and so my question is a
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more inside baseball but um I
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
noticed that there's no case law in here
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
like you would find in the real rsas and
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
that apparently was a conscious choice
 
00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:18.519 align:start position:0%
but case law in my 14 years here has
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
proven sometimes critical to
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
understanding what's going on in
 
00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:23.519 align:start position:0%
statutes and I'm wondering why the case
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
law is not
 
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
shown um
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at my version of the
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
book because I agree with you I like the
 
00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:34.039 align:start position:0%
case on I don't think you have to be a
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
lawyer to appreciate how the court has
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
interpreted something uh I I can't speak
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
to why the decision was made for that
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
particular book that's outside of my uh
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge base um might have been a a
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
publishing decision okay well thank you
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you can I just follow up on that
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
because that's a very important Point
 
00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:58.519 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with various types of uh uh
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
educational issues sending children to
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
another school district when I went to
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
look up the Lisbon case regarding
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
manifest education it was in the old
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
books not in this book that the case law
 
00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:11.799 align:start position:0%
is extremely important when we're
 
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with Claremont issues and others
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
right now it it belongs in our
 
00:31:20.909 --> 00:31:20.919 align:start position:0%
books represent cordelli thank you Mr
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you uh attorney Fenton
 
00:31:28.629 --> 00:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
um in terms of rules I think even more
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
important um part is special education
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
there is a lot in special education
 
00:31:39.629 --> 00:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
rules that is not in statute nor in
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
federal law and there is a statute
 
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
specifically granting the department the
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
ability to make rules without a statute
 
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
behind them um so I think having special
 
00:31:57.629 --> 00:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
ed rules um is uh even even more
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
important than um many of the other
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
areas uh well again I I don't disagree
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that when the
 
00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:10.039 align:start position:0%
special ed rules were revised which was
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
about 2015
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
2016 um pursuant to the idea money the
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
department did publish the the special
 
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
ed rules um because I think it's exactly
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
what you testified to part of your
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
question just the importance of them and
 
00:32:26.629 --> 00:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
the complexity of them so I I do believe
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
those books are available I have seen
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
them I have one I I'm not sure what the
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
exact distribution is but if what this
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
committee is really asking for is a copy
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
of those books I can certainly speak
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
with Becky fet and see if I can provide
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
those I would also suggest I think they
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
have this down in Senate education they
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
have a bookshelf with some of the the
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
books on it the Senate books and the
 
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
rule books and so that might be a
 
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
possible solution as well um Everyone
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
likes to have their own own book I write
 
00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
my name on mine so I certainly
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
understand that but just in terms of
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
having it as a reference that might be a
 
00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
a reasonable approach as well it used to
 
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
be sop standard operating procedure that
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
they were handed out to members of the
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
committee at the first you know day we
 
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
met B the special ed rules the rules for
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
school approval um all that we we got
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
copies and that somehow stopped and it
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
stopped I would go back at least six or
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
seven eight years ago with stopped
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
coming like that and I know that various
 
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
chairs been here have had that concern
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm glad you're here today listening
 
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
to US Representative luno thanks thanks
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and thanks very much
 
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
um attorney Penton for joining us this
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
morning so um you've you've sort of laid
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
out some some logistical concerns with
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of printing
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
books um uh the loss of uh the absence
 
00:33:57.789 --> 00:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
of case law
 
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
um in in at least the these copies here
 
00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
and and also um the possibility of
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
printing rules but how does it work for
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
I mean outside of the legislature how
 
00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
does it work for school administrators
 
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
and school
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
boards yeah thank you for the question
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
um I know when I first started six years
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
ago at the
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
department we would get a huge order of
 
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
these law books um there would be very
 
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
various types of these law books over
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
the years some of them had the case laws
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
others didn't I believe that is a
 
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
publishing decision I don't think that's
 
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
coming from us we're kind of at the beck
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
and call and the whim of the publisher
 
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
um historically representative luno the
 
00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
department minor Shams we would provide
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
a copy of the book to every U and I
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
think over time um that has just changed
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
um and I don't I can't speak to the
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
exact reason for that change I don't
 
00:34:59.470 --> 00:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
know if it was a cost or a Personnel
 
00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:01.839 align:start position:0%
change I'm not sure and moving forward
 
00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:04.599 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you I'm not sure how
 
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
the the saus now receive that
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
information that might be on them to to
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
seek that out um I think the reality is
 
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
we had an issue with the publisher the
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
publisher indicated they didn't want to
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
publish these books anymore and that
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
changed a lot of our former practice and
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
we're seeing the results of that for
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
that that change in
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
practice um so we can certainly you know
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
look into how that is that is handled
 
00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:32.839 align:start position:0%
because the testimony is clear that
 
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
everyone appreciates the information and
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
it's important to have we the department
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't disagree with that at all
 
00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:40.349 align:start position:0%
doesn't disagree with that at all
representative

00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
Mullen thank you Mr chair and welcome
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
back uh attorney Fenton uh so my concern
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
I want to go back to something that
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
representative lad referenced to earlier
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh my concern has to do with updating
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
the rsas online I don't know whether or
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
not this is something that you feel
 
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable speaking to but I'm curious
 
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
as to what the process is for
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
updating the electronic version of the
 
00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:13.640 align:start position:0%
rsas because I um feel relatively
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable on a computer and I find
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
it super circumventing to have to go to
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
Google to figure out how to uh get the
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
inside information that I need when I'm
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
considering some change or a new law so
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
I if you wouldn't mind commenting on
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
that sure I mean I can certainly uh
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
agree with where you're coming from I I
 
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
myself and the department have nothing
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
to do with updating the laws on the
 
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
website I would anticipate that um the
 
00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
state has and this is pure speculation
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
on my part but my guess is um the state
 
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
has a contract with either wlaw or Lexus
 
00:36:58.589 --> 00:36:58.599 align:start position:0%
Nexus those are the two big legal
 
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
publishing companies um that would then
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
update update the laws on the website so
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
I think that is all kind of behind the
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
scenes thing uh the joke in law school
 
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
was everyone who couldn't pass the bar
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
went to work for one of the publishing
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
companies that then updated the laws and
 
00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:16.599 align:start position:0%
I see the fellow attorney nodding her
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
head which always makes me feel good um
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
so I think that's that's what you're
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
seeing that has nothing to do with the
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
department so just a followup if you
 
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
will Mr chair um attorney Fenton I think
 
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
uh you would agree that there are times
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
when I contact you to ask you to send me
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
the information that I need because I
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
can't find it somewhere um I do agree
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
with that is there is there I right I
 
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
like to make sure you have work to do
 
00:37:47.069 --> 00:37:47.079 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton I appreciate that yes so
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
is there where do you go to
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
electronically get if you will the
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
updated information on an RSA that might
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
have recently been enacted uh well I
 
00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:04.839 align:start position:0%
just to be clear I I thought you were
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
calling me because you liked me so now I
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
I have to rethink a lot of things in my
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
life but um in terms of where do I go um
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
I I do get copies of this book every
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
January I'm not sure where my most
 
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
recent copy is I uh the department
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
through the department of Ed I have a
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
subscription to um Lexus Nexus and so I
 
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:27.640 align:start position:0%
can go on to that website that Search
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
tool um that is a uh something that we
 
00:38:33.069 --> 00:38:33.079 align:start position:0%
subscribe to when I first started the
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
department we did not have Westlaw we
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
did not did not have Lexus Nexus and I
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
said in order to do my job I need one of
 
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
those search tools so we have a contract
 
00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
with them um and myself and the other
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
attorney and my assistant have access to
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
it um and I don't
 
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
know we also have I have a New Hampshire
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh what is it the New Hampshire bar has
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh a Search tool tool similar to that
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
um I I will tell you historically when I
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
worked with law enforcement I got
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
everyone in law enforcement access to
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire bar Search tool which
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
is very similar to West law and and
 
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
Lexus Nexus I don't even know if that
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
exists anymore but if that's something
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
the committee would like me to look into
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to do it we did it for law
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement I don't see why we couldn't
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
do it for for the legislature um I did
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
it once I certainly would appreciate
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
that anything you can do to help us it's
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
appreciated I'd be happy to do that I I
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
can't make any promises but we've done
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
it before successfully so okay rep
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Porter thank you Mr chair
 
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you um M Fenton this is my
 
00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
first time on education I'm new um and I
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
admit even though I've been in the
 
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
legislature for a while I still can't
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
figure out how to find what I'm looking
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
for in the rsas and I know this morning
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
I was late because I spent about 25
 
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
minutes trying to find out the uh
 
00:39:59.069 --> 00:39:59.079 align:start position:0%
particulars of the education Freedom
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
account rules and regulations um and I
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't find them I could find them in
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
the bills but I couldn't find them
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
because I didn't know unless I looked
 
00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:10.839 align:start position:0%
through House Bill two where I was going
 
00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:13.079 align:start position:0%
to find those so what recommendation do
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
you have for those of us NE fites at
 
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
this to help us before we get all these
 
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
other helps just go to Google should I
 
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
have Googled is that what I should have
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
done I could have Googled it okay so
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's out there it's just not
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
here well thank you for the question I I
 
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
do think um I mean even as a lawyer I
 
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
have a hard time finding things so it's
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
not because you're new it's just
 
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
challenging at times
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
um I would perhaps
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
suggest because I think the lift to say
 
00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
publish all the rules would would be too
 
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
much of a heavy lift but perhaps it
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
makes sense to say every time a new rule
 
00:41:01.309 --> 00:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
is passed a rule in in a particular area
 
00:41:04.109 --> 00:41:04.119 align:start position:0%
such as education Freedom accounts
 
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps there is a publishing
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
requirement and a distribution
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
requirement that is what I see as as a
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable solution and and but it would
 
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
have to have a fiscal note because that
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
is a cost that the department can't just
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
absorb um and we would have to be
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
mindful that I think personnel-wise we
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
could absorb the Personnel cost but the
 
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
cost of the publishing and the printing
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
would be additional and that would be my
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
concern is that the department does do
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
an enormous amount of rule making um and
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
and production in that sense but I think
 
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
it is a reasonable request when these
 
00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
rules are finalized and and adopted um
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
and I would like to go back to something
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner said during her
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
testimony is that if this committee is
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
interested in in further further
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
explanation on the rul making process
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
which can be AIT bit mysterious at times
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
we the department would be happy to to
 
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
do a brief presentation on
 
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
that thank thank you very much uh
 
00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:09.430 align:start position:0%
that thank thank you very much uh
representative

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
B and represent lus thank you Mr
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks even taking the question
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
you said the Publishers are not going to
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
publish but is it the same publisher for
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
all our committees or does every
 
00:42:26.349 --> 00:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
committee have a different publisher
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and I know this is
 
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
still probably the biggest book of all
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
of them how were all the others
 
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
published the
 
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
same it's a little bit out of my area of
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge but I do believe that it's
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's similar Publishers and yes we get
 
00:42:45.069 --> 00:42:45.079 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice books um every year
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
yeah uh all I can tell you is what I've
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
heard is that the publisher has
 
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
indicated not promised not stated it's
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
just indicated that they might not be
 
00:42:56.549 --> 00:42:56.559 align:start position:0%
publishing this moving forward um and
 
00:42:58.549 --> 00:42:58.559 align:start position:0%
that is nothing to do with the
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
Department that's right outside of our
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
control than represent like
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
us yes if we have the big book from what
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
three years ago and we have the little
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
book from this
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
year um will we have except for the case
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
law will we have all of those things
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
that you were talking about camps and
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
you know whatever so like if we want
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
those things we can just go back to the
 
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
big big the older big book or have they
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
changed uh you can certainly refer to
 
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
the big book for those sections that are
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
no longer in the smaller book but I will
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
tell you that anytime you refer to Old
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
Law you
 
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
are you taking your life in your hand so
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
to speak you should be shepher ising and
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
and getting the most uh recent upto-date
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
um laws and I I do think the reality is
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
there have been significant
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
changes even in the past the six years
 
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
that I've been here this book changes
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
all the time and so I I personally would
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
reference one more question then we're
 
00:44:16.549 --> 00:44:16.559 align:start position:0%
gonna move on to next go ahead
 
00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
representative this is more a comment
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
than a question but I'm old and I went
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
to law school before we had all the
 
00:44:24.549 --> 00:44:24.559 align:start position:0%
electronic stuff and I have sort of
 
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
stuck by using hard copy books we have a
 
00:44:29.309 --> 00:44:29.319 align:start position:0%
set of the rsas right there that I pull
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
all the time in every committee I've
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
ever been on and they are updated they
 
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
have the new law in the book and they
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
have the case law in the rsas so every
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
one of these committee rooms has a
 
00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
current set of laws in them and I can
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
see some sort of case law on top I'm not
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
sure what's over there but we but these
 
00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
rooms all have RSA so we have current
 
00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
law in this book and I'll help anybody
 
00:44:53.549 --> 00:44:53.559 align:start position:0%
with hard copy because I'm much more
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
confident on hard copy than I am on Lex
 
00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
is Nexus or anything else so I'm just
 
00:44:59.549 --> 00:44:59.559 align:start position:0%
trying to say some of this is already
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
here we're talking about not having it
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
but we do have it and we don't have the
 
00:45:04.589 --> 00:45:04.599 align:start position:0%
rules and what I would say to add to
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
that is it would be great if we had a
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
copy of the rules over there for this
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
committee at least because the rules are
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
so crucial in education so even one copy
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
of the rules in the room would be a
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
great reference point that we can pull
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
out and as I have done in other
 
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
committees and just used during a
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
hearing when it a particular subject
 
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
comes up so I know it's not a question
 
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm just trying to make clarify what
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing in the room well I
 
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
think the the uh we do have out in the
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
office here also all the statutory books
 
00:45:38.349 --> 00:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
here annotated books going way back I
 
00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
would say 20076 go they're all on a
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
shelf out there you can go back year by
 
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
year there's one copy of each that's
 
00:45:48.549 --> 00:45:48.559 align:start position:0%
very helpful but the rules are also
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
something that we used to receive that
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
we don't I think that's extremely
 
00:45:56.349 --> 00:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
important that we have copies of that um
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
so I I think where you you're going
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
you're hearing our
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
concerns and it's just going to make our
 
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
job better if we can have access to this
 
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
information I agree if we're looking for
 
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
some little minuscule area that we did
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
in hb2 which is a bill of what 100 plus
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
Pages you got to search through that to
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
find it and you have to go on the web
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
and look the bill up to find out what
 
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
exactly is in it because you're not
 
00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
going to find it in statute yet
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
the issue of uh the uh B the the buses
 
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
on the infrastructure
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
monies that that's not in in in on the
 
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
web yet and yet I can go back and find
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
it under the bill that makes it very
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
difficult for a person that's trying to
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
write legislation or respond to a person
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
in the public with current information
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
so we need some help and I we'd
 
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate working with you on this
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely the department looks forward
 
00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.790 align:start position:0%
absolutely the department looks forward
to

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much if there's not
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
any other questions we're going to close
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
this hearing I think we've communicated
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
Our concern and I thank the sponsor for
 
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill in uh we will now
 
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
move in could we get pink cards from our
 
00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:10.510 align:start position:0%
move in could we get pink cards from our
two

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
testifiers good
 
00:47:16.109 --> 00:47:16.119 align:start position:0%
point okay so we're now ready to go on
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
to the second bill today that be a
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
hearing for uh HB
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
1624 that's relative to students with
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities participating in
 
00:47:26.829 --> 00:47:26.839 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activi ities and making an
 
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation thereof and looks like we
 
00:47:32.109 --> 00:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
have the sponsor
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%

bill House Bill 1624 is a retread um
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%

committee um it is a bipartisan bill you
 
00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:49.559 align:start position:0%

originally this bill stemm from uh
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative uh Moffett over there uh
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
he had this bill in the F our first term
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
together in 17 and 18 um the bill passed
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
the uh committee and ended up with an
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
inm study recommendation uh in the
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
second year we studied the bill it came
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
out as a commission Bill the following
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
term that bill passed this committee Uh
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
I chaired that that commission which
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
looked at the impact of unified
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities within school
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
districts and what the limits were or
 
00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
what the things were holding back from
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
districts um executing or providing
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
unified co-curricular activities if
 
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
you're not familiar with uh unified
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities these are
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
activities that um are used both with
 
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
special needs students as well as
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
regular students um and and usually it's
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
a 50-50 mix most often it's in sports
 
00:48:59.230 --> 00:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
programs uh you'll see unified soccer
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
unified basketball but uh there's a
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
school in New Hampshire doing unified
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
theater putting on specific uh events
 
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
that will cater to some of the special
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
needs students to put on a program so
 
00:49:13.549 --> 00:49:13.559 align:start position:0%
it's not limited to Just Sports um this
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
bill after uh the uh commission last
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
term I was able to get late Drafting and
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
we put this bill in it passed this
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
committee unanimously on a policy basis
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
it hit finance and I hit a snap
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
um there were some things that were
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
missing in the bill that Finance wanted
 
00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
to see I fixed that in this bill and I
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
re resubmitted the bill uh it creates a
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
a $50,000 grant program within the
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um that $50,000
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
has a two-tiered purpose the first tier
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
is if there are applicants school
 
00:49:47.789 --> 00:49:47.799 align:start position:0%
districts looking to start new unified
 
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh co-curricular activities um this will
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
pay for the one-time cost for starting
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
those programs so I'm going to stick to
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
sports CU it's the easiest one and I was
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
a soccer coach in my school district so
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
I understand it um so if the school
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
district wanted to start a Unified
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
co-curricular sports program soccer
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
program one of the big hurdles is the
 
00:50:11.549 --> 00:50:11.559 align:start position:0%
initial uh funding of a of uh that sport
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
so buying uniforms buying the medical
 
00:50:16.829 --> 00:50:16.839 align:start position:0%
kit for the trainer buying the um soccer
 
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
balls those kind of things are a big
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
one-time upfront expense um and so this
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
bill looks to offset that expense and
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
allow people starting to to submit an
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
application uh requesting the purchase
 
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
of just the expense for equipment the
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
one time um one of the uh I served on
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
the school board for six years and
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
served on the budget committee before
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
that one of the big bait and switches
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
that they always we always hear about
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
with uh School boards and and taxpayers
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
is the state funds at the first time and
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
then the school districts left with the
 
00:50:50.109 --> 00:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
ongoing cost going on we made this a
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
hybrid bill so in other words what I
 
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
mean by that is that we're only paying
 
00:50:55.789 --> 00:50:55.799 align:start position:0%
the equipment costs the schools still
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
has to commit to the expense of a coach
 
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
so they know what they're buying in for
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
the long-term expenses when they decide
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
to apply for the grant and get it um and
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
there's no surprises to the taxpayer so
 
00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
if they're starting a program and there
 
00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:09.640 align:start position:0%
a stiping to go to a teacher to coach
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
that then um that that school dist has
 
00:51:15.069 --> 00:51:15.079 align:start position:0%
to accept the stien cost as an ongoing
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
cost but the one-time cost could be
 
00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:19.430 align:start position:0%
offset by this
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:21.069 align:start position:0%
offset by this
[Music]

00:51:21.069 --> 00:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
um again I I this passed this committee
 
00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:26.359 align:start position:0%
last last and the last session it was on
 
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
consent calendar on a on a unanimous
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
vote and I hope that we'd get similar
 
00:51:33.069 --> 00:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
support for for this bill again the
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
policy hasn't changed um I just fix the
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
problems with the
 
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
finances thank you very much
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative Lang uh there are
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
questions represent bone are you aware
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
there are some schools I know Bedford is
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
already doing this and other schools
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
also so do we really need a bill to to
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
do it when it's already being done thank
 
00:51:57.069 --> 00:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
you for that representative B I
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so again when I chaired
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
that commission the number one uh reason
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
we heard for school districts that don't
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
have programs that are looking to start
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
programs was tightening budgets was that
 
00:52:09.549 --> 00:52:09.559 align:start position:0%
one that onetime cost like they might be
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
fine with paying a teacher $750 stien
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
but the $4,500 expense to start the
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
program was a problem um to buy the
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
medical gear the the uniforms and the
 
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
and the sporting gear um the other thing
 
00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
I meant to say and I apologize there's a
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
second tier to this program on the on
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
the on the um grant program and that is
 
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
that if the doe has met all the
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
requirements for new programs the
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
secondary uh use of those funds would be
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
to replace equipment in school districts
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
that already have it so in your case if
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
they have it and there's money left over
 
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
out of the $50,000 we budget annually
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
then that the school district could say
 
00:52:49.789 --> 00:52:49.799 align:start position:0%
we need to replace the soccer uniforms
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
we've had it for the last seven years
 
00:52:53.309 --> 00:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
and the kids are wearing rags and so
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
they could apply to replace those Rags
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
if there's money left over in the grand
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
program so it supports not only new
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
programs but potentially ongoing
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
programs to keep the cost down for the
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
local taxpayer and keep those programs
 
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
my my daughter um actually both my
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
daughters and my son participated in the
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
Unified sports program and and I have to
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
say that those programs are probably the
 
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
most uplifting of all the programs that
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
I attended at the when you go to a
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
school if you go to unified basketball
 
00:53:22.829 --> 00:53:22.839 align:start position:0%
Sports the community support and the
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
student support is amazing um and on
 
00:53:27.549 --> 00:53:27.559 align:start position:0%
what goes on and we want to encourage
 
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
making our children really good human
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
beings so I I'd encourage this program
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you Mr chair um I first of
 
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
all totally agree it's it's probably the
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
most uplifting program in in a school um
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
and it affects uh in a very positive way
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
both the uh students that are coming
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
from uh disabilities and and special
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
education or perhaps having you know
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
difficulty in some way in school with
 
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
the um general population in the school
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
that I've seen changes on both sides uh
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
my question is does this uh at all go to
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation because I I feel like a
 
00:54:15.309 --> 00:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
soccer ball and some T-shirts are no big
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
deal but transportation seems to be one
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
of the things that keeps these teams
 
00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
from uh just in housee thank you for
 
00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
your question and the short answer is no
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
the short says I didn't do
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
Transportation costs in this again there
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
there are certain expenses the school
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
district needs to accept and that's an
 
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
unknown if I have one game it's going to
 
00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:34.839 align:start position:0%
be$ one amount if I have 10 games it's
 
00:54:35.789 --> 00:54:35.799 align:start position:0%
going to be a different dollar amount
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's an unknown that uh I don't think I
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
want to get the Board of Education
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
involved the Department of Education
 
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
involved in trying to figure out funding
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
for that um and so again this is part of
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
the I I'm I'm really nervous about bait
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
and switches right and and we put
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
together a program we encourag it the
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
state we fund it for one year and then
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
the school districts are left hanging
 
00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
after the second year year and they have
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
to cancel or do something else because
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
the funding's up there this is very
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
clear the labor and the transportation
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
costs are strictly on a school they need
 
00:55:03.309 --> 00:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
to know those they'll figure out what
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
those costs are based on what they
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate what the program will look
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
like and then that's on the local
 
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and the school boards to decide
 
00:55:11.789 --> 00:55:11.799 align:start position:0%
if they want to do that further
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
questions representa Cornell Thank you
 
00:55:16.589 --> 00:55:16.599 align:start position:0%
for taking my question this is enabling
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
for districts that want to start
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
something like this it's not mandating
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
that they have to do absolutely not it's
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
just the grant program the school
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
district the school district if they
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
choose they want to put on again I'm
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
going to stick to sports because it's
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
the easiest one I I I I know if they
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
want to do a unified soccer program they
 
00:55:34.349 --> 00:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
could in the next coming year they can
 
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
apply for the grant and then if they get
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
the grant then they can hire their coach
 
00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%
and do their things if they don't get
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
the grant they can put it off right
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
again it's it's just allows the district
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
to apply for the grant with doe and uh
 
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
and see there is if I remember right I
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
put a sunset clause in here with a
 
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
reporting feature got to remember if I
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
did that or not I know I was yes there
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
is so again beginning of the fiscal year
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
2027 and every 5 years thereafter the
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
department will conduct an efficiency
 
00:55:59.029 --> 00:55:59.039 align:start position:0%
review of the programs and expenditures
 
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
under this paragraph and make
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the legislator so the
 
00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:04.839 align:start position:0%
idea was we'll get reporting back if the
 
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
$50,000 are being spent are just sitting
 
00:56:08.349 --> 00:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
there idle and if it's being idle then
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
let's repeal a statute it's not
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
needed thank you further
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative litfield
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative lad for taking my
 
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
question I just wanted to ask you um
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
number one how was the $50,000 how was
 
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:29.559 align:start position:0%
that number determined number one and
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
number two clearly it would depend upon
 
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
what type of program is being instituted
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious how many different
 
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
districts do you anticipate this
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
benefiting sure thank you very much so
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
so in working with Special Olympics who
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
were was part of my uh commission that I
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
did two years ago where I chaired um it
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
was estimated was about $2,500 expense
 
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
per program uh to start if you're
 
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
looking at sports because that's what
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
Special Olympics does is the sports
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
program so uh was an estimated that
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
equipment cost was around $2,500 so this
 
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
would present 20 possible opportunities
 
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:07.039 align:start position:0%
state thank you uh I've got a question
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
for you um looking at the bill you've
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
given the authority to make rules on
 
00:57:13.789 --> 00:57:13.799 align:start position:0%
this to the commissioner or to the
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
department is that to uh will that also
 
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh develop and end up with the
 
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
criteria or the process in which to
 
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
award these grants will there be certain
 
00:57:29.789 --> 00:57:29.799 align:start position:0%
prioritization uh on and handing out the
 
00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
$50,000 total or is every school going
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
to get you know a little bit of a chunk
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
How's that gonna I I don't want to speak
 
00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
for uh the commissioner on what he plans
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
on doing but again I'll say this I serve
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
on ja car as well so I see the rules
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
that come from Board of Education Direct
 
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Education into into the
 
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
into the state and for execution and one
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
of the things I know is they'll need to
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
create a form for this to be able to
 
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
have the uh depart you know the agencies
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
file requests for it so again the idea
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
was to give them broad rulemaking
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
authority to how they want to administer
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
this program thank you are there further
 
00:58:04.589 --> 00:58:04.599 align:start position:0%

01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
background the farm to school program
 
01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
nourishes children supports local
 
01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
farmers and economies and strengthens
 
01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
the resil resiliency of our supply chain
 
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
some schools and communities already
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
participate in the New Hampshire Farm to
 
01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
school program and experience these
 
01:33:21.159 --> 01:33:22.229 align:start position:0%
school program and experience these
positive

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
positive
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
results the investment we are asking the
 
01:33:27.109 --> 01:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
state legislature to make will make it
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
possible for schools and communities all
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
over the state to take advantage of the
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
benefit of local food for local
 
01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
schools with this policy we can improve
 
01:33:38.669 --> 01:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
the health and well-being of our
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
children and the resiliency of our local
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
food system the department of
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
education's office of nutrition programs
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
and services would provide a monetary
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
incentive to schools who choose to
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
direct more of their per meal cash
 
01:33:56.669 --> 01:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
reimbursement funds from the USDA
 
01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
towards purchases from New Hampshire and
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
New England
 
01:34:02.669 --> 01:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
Farmers the state would encourage this
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
channeling of federal funds into the
 
01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
local economy by awarding schools a
 
01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:10.360 align:start position:0%
dollar for every $3 spent on food from
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and a dollar for every $6
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
spent on food from the New England
 
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
region the goal is for our local schools
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
to be purchasing at least 10% of their
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
food from local farms
 
01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
across the
 
01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
state by offering every school a
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
reimbursement up to $1,200 we would be
 
01:34:30.590 --> 01:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
investing in our children's health by
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
redirecting 1.2 million federal dollars
 
01:34:36.189 --> 01:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
into our local economy we ensure that we
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
build Food Systems infrastructure that
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
will make us resilient for the future
 
01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
our children's health and the health of
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
our farms and farming communities are
 
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
worth the investment from the state a
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
robust Farm to school program will help
 
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
strengthen New Hampshire's agricultural
 
01:34:57.070 --> 01:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
sector and Regional food security it
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
will also help New Hampshire students
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
understand the regional agricultural
 
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
Geographic social and cultural aspects
 
01:35:06.669 --> 01:35:06.679 align:start position:0%
of our food system in New
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire before I hand it over to
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative Murray who will talk
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
more I I'm wondering if it would be okay
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%

01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
1657 FNA the farm to school
 
01:36:24.990 --> 01:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement program I understand many
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
schools are currently making purchases
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
from local farmers but we are in direct
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
competition with the retail sales which
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
hinders our ability to increase the
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
amount we would like to purchase or for
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
some schools to make any purchases
 
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
currently as I have in the past I do
 
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
make purchases from local farmers
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
vendors within New Hampshire and other
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
New England states beef fish fruit maple
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
syrup vegetables to name a few the
 
01:36:51.390 --> 01:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
positive effects of this bill will allow
 
01:36:53.229 --> 01:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
schools to purchase more local Goods
 
01:36:55.709 --> 01:36:55.719 align:start position:0%
within our region help our local farmers
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
and increase the relationships within
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
the community this bill would also allow
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
many educational moments for our
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
students to understand the importance of
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
where our food comes from how far it may
 
01:37:07.950 --> 01:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
travel and the direct impact it does
 
01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
have on the environment and economy this
 
01:37:11.470 --> 01:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
is such a
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
positive I speak for myself that our
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
current supply chain issue show how
 
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
important purchasing local is to having
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
a food supply for my schools I have
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
spent hours looking for items that are
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
grown processed and produced in our area
 
01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
schools across New Hampshire have been
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
working hard to develop relationships
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
with farmers and to learn and understand
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
how we both are able to support and
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
educate our community on the importance
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
of purchasing local Goods this bill will
 
01:37:41.709 --> 01:37:41.719 align:start position:0%
help in ways that will only be seen
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
after it is passed and working in our
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
state when funding stays local it grows
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
the economy supports our community and
 
01:37:50.589 --> 01:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
shows how important keeping our local
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
farms grow growing is to maintain a food
 
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
source for all citizens within our state

across the state there um different
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
schools operate in different ways but um
 
01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
often times community members are also
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
involved in connecting schools and
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%

hubs that help with that sometimes Farms
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%

um as I said a lot of the stakeholders
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
have been working on this for a few
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
years and based also in some of the
 
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
research that's been done about um
 
01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:06.159 align:start position:0%
resilience food system resiliency in New
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
England and in New Hampshire there's a
 
01:40:12.669 --> 01:40:12.679 align:start position:0%
goal of having um I would say we all
 
01:40:15.149 --> 01:40:15.159 align:start position:0%
have a goal of like 10% of the money
 
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
that we spend on food in local schools
 
01:40:20.589 --> 01:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
would be spent locally so that instead
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
of those the $1.2 million that comes in
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
from the federal government if we could
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
instead of sending that outside of New
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire send that into New Hampshire
 
01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
we could build up our own resiliency
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
right and so if the state invests
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
$600,000 $40,000 of which would be the
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
um technology infrastructure that would
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
have to support the program and 560,000
 
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
plus that 1.2 million that's 10% of the
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
money that we spend in New Hampshire on
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:54.159 --> 01:40:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
food

01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:03.589 --> 01:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I'm trying to understand um I
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
guess why this is needed cannot the
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
schools already buy local Goods if they
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
want to using the federal money do the
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
local Goods cost more or why are they
 
01:41:19.709 --> 01:41:19.719 align:start position:0%
not currently doing that because I know
 
01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
we have lots of really good you know
 
01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
farms and produce and all kinds of stuff
 
01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
in the state why are schools not doing
 
01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:28.709 align:start position:0%
in the state why are schools not doing
that

01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:28.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:32.109 --> 01:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
now I just I don't understand some
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
schools are doing it um and some schools
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
are not and so this is an incentive for
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
schools who are not doing it to
 
01:41:43.149 --> 01:41:43.159 align:start position:0%
participate but it's also just a little
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
bit and I think Jean mentioned this in
 
01:41:49.149 --> 01:41:49.159 align:start position:0%
her testimony um it's also just a little
 
01:41:52.030 --> 01:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
bit of money that's extra for the budget
 
01:41:53.709 --> 01:41:53.719 align:start position:0%
for school nutrition so school
 
01:41:55.629 --> 01:41:55.639 align:start position:0%
nutritionists will tell you that they
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
operate in a very narrow narrow budget
 
01:42:02.109 --> 01:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
and that when they um have even a little
 
01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
bit more to operate then they are able
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
to access local food more so often times
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
um there are some products that are the
 
01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
same price um and there are some
 
01:42:18.109 --> 01:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
products that are um cheaper if you buy
 
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
them elsewhere but it's more it's better
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
for the students and better for the
 
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
economy to buy them from here so having
 
01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
that little $1,200 kind of makes a big
 
01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
difference in some schools especially
 
01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:32.310 align:start position:0%
difference in some schools especially
smaller

01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:35.870 --> 01:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
schools further questions representative
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
Tanner uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Simpson for coming
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
with this this great idea um this was
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
something that you know I'm ancient so a
 
01:42:50.189 --> 01:42:50.199 align:start position:0%
long time ago we tried to do this at our
 
01:42:50.199 --> 01:42:51.350 align:start position:0%
long time ago we tried to do this at our
school

01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:42:54.030 --> 01:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
and um the big push back was not the
 
01:42:57.149 --> 01:42:57.159 align:start position:0%
Farms not the money but the retail
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
Distributors who can distribute for
 
01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:00.910 align:start position:0%
Distributors who can distribute for
example

01:43:00.910 --> 01:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
Tomatoes uh 247 360 days a year because
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
they get them from all over whereas the
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
local farmers um could give us quite a
 
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
deal in August uh with the Tomato crops
 
01:43:17.310 --> 01:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
that were coming in even even local
 
01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
people you know the farmers market the
 
01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
little Farmers Market thing in the in
 
01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
the common um and at that time the
 
01:43:27.149 --> 01:43:27.159 align:start position:0%
distributor really told our food service
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh manager that if she were to buy the
 
01:43:33.629 --> 01:43:33.639 align:start position:0%
tomatoes from local Distributors um he
 
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
was not going to distribute fruits and
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
vegetables to her
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
anymore uh the and that's kind of the
 
01:43:42.910 --> 01:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
hammer that that I think the retail uh
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
areas have and I'm just wondering I
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
noticed that um your food service person
 
01:43:51.629 --> 01:43:51.639 align:start position:0%
in her testimony that you read mentioned
 
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
just briefly mentioned about the
 
01:43:55.870 --> 01:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
Distributors and I was wondering if how
 
01:43:59.229 --> 01:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
much of a roadblock that still is and uh
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
maybe how you're thinking about uh
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with that thank you um sure so
 
01:44:07.709 --> 01:44:07.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure when that was how long ago
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
that was but I do know in the past 10
 
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
years the um Local Food Systems
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure has really improved and I
 
01:44:17.629 --> 01:44:17.639 align:start position:0%
think you're going to hear from someone
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
from one of our food hubs in one of the
 
01:44:22.030 --> 01:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
regions of the State who will be able to
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
speak more probably to that question but
 
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
um kind of big picture I I do want to
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
say that it really it is different now
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
than it has ever been in that school
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
some schools are already working
 
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
together to have a larger to have larger
 
01:44:40.270 --> 01:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
buying power when they approach um
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
suppliers and Distributors so um and
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
they have often the backing of folks in
 
01:44:49.390 --> 01:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
their Community who can also help them
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
um navigate some of that that but I'd
 
01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
like for others who are working in that
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
process to answer that question more
 
01:44:56.239 --> 01:44:58.030 align:start position:0%
process to answer that question more
specifically

01:44:58.030 --> 01:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
yeah represent Moffett thank you Mr
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here uh we
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
got a a good number of emails on this
 
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
which they looked at last night so
 
01:45:09.709 --> 01:45:09.719 align:start position:0%
there's some real enthusiasm and I'm
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
sensing great energy for this and uh I
 
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
just noticed the analysis it it
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
establishes a uh Farm to school
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
reimburse reimbursement program so it
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
establishes a program and I see the the
 
01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
$600,000 note um I'm trying to
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
understand is this a a permanent program
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
that Doe will somehow be in involved
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
with can you explain permanent or or is
 
01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
this a permanent program or sure let me
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
talk about that for a little bit um so I
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
did notice in the fiscal note that um
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
when we we've spoken with Folks at
 
01:45:48.149 --> 01:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
nutrition services and the Department of
 
01:45:50.589 --> 01:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
Education and they did not indicate to
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
us that they would need extra staff
 
01:45:56.669 --> 01:45:56.679 align:start position:0%
people to um administer this program so
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
I was a little surprised when I saw that
 
01:45:59.950 --> 01:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
in the fisical note that it talked about
 
01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
that but um it
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
would I mean if it succeeds I would hope
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
it would be permanent yeah for sure um
 
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
but right now it's uh the 600,000 for
 
01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:15.229 align:start position:0%
but right now it's uh the 600,000 for
one

01:46:15.229 --> 01:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
year thank you so answer your question
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
so so I understand this to be a oneyear
 
01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
general fund initiative not a permanent
 
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.270 align:start position:0%
general fund initiative not a permanent
program

01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
correct I that's a good
 
01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:34.229 align:start position:0%
correct I that's a good
question

01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to find the
 
01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
bill I don't I'll be honest with you I
 
01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:41.560 align:start position:0%
don't think it would be worth the
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
investment in the technology as much if
 
01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
it were just a one-year program um so I
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
think the intention especially back to
 
01:46:51.550 --> 01:46:51.560 align:start position:0%
the distributor and supplier issue the
 
01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
intention is that by focusing money in
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
the local economy we would also allow
 
01:46:59.709 --> 01:46:59.719 align:start position:0%
communities like in real life who are
 
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get food from farms to schools
 
01:47:05.070 --> 01:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to set up the social networks
 
01:47:08.430 --> 01:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
that make that happen right and so once
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
those networks are up it would be nice
 
01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
to keep them going um if the if the
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
incentive works for a year that's great
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
I think we just address it again again
 
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
in a year if if everybody thinks it's
 
01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
going well and we rah rah um there is a
 
01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
lot of energy behind it right I think
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
we'd address it again in a year and see
 
01:47:33.550 --> 01:47:33.560 align:start position:0%
if we want to make it permanent but it
 
01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't I don't think it's in the bill
 
01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
that it be
 
01:47:38.350 --> 01:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
permanent thank thank you that's a
 
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
really I think to me that's a crucial
 
01:47:40.639 --> 01:47:42.910 align:start position:0%
really I think to me that's a crucial
question

01:47:42.910 --> 01:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I I have a question for you
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
and then we'll move on to other people
 
01:47:49.589 --> 01:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
might speak on this bill I come from a
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
farming community havil it's up in the
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River much of the land in
 
01:47:58.830 --> 01:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
havil is now owned by farmers in
 
01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
Vermont um the tier one is uh for foods
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
that originate in New Hampshire yes um
 
01:48:11.470 --> 01:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
crops which are grown in New Hampshire
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
but then processed across the river in
 
01:48:16.750 --> 01:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
Vermont and some of it's vice versa too
 
01:48:18.669 --> 01:48:18.679 align:start position:0%
we consider ourselves up there one
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
region right and and and uh we have uh
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
many dairies in this state that are
 
01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:29.560 align:start position:0%
Co-op or milk has gone out to New York
 
01:48:32.109 --> 01:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
or Massachusetts Etc and then comes back
 
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
by a company out there and then we have
 
01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
hatchland dairy in my particular
 
01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
Community where everything is done right
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
there produced bottled drunk in New
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and of course they sell
 
01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
outside to Massachusetts and Vermont as
 
01:48:50.229 --> 01:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
well so I guess the question I have here
 
01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
here is that um is um the milk that goes
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
out of state is that and comes back in
 
01:49:01.870 --> 01:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
through a uh organization that's owned
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
and Corporation that's owned elsewhere
 
01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
is that going to get this benefit or is
 
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
a person like Howard hatch who has
 
01:49:12.589 --> 01:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
hatchin dairy in hail going to get the
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
benefit the priority will be to food
 
01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:21.320 align:start position:0%
that is Gran and um Dairy Etc produced
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to be um used in New
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that's the priority is
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
local the local food to the
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
local schools so I I I guess and
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
followup the origin of the food would
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
have been New
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it's going outside the
 
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
state and then coming back in the form
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
of hood or whomever my booth Brothers
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
whatever and so is that going to count
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
as a tier one or is that going to be a
 
01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:54.550 align:start position:0%
as a tier one or is that going to be a
tier

01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
tier
 
01:49:58.109 --> 01:49:58.119 align:start position:0%
two so representative lad chairman I I
 
01:50:00.270 --> 01:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
will give you my opinion I think that
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
that will be worked out in the rules in
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
the rul making I don't think that's in
 
01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
the bill I think that will have to be
 
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
hashed out in the details of rule making
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
am I wrong about that well I'm I'm just
 
01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
a little confused and I've talked to
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
folks over there at the Department of
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and marketing here in the
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
state and there's there there are
 
01:50:22.510 --> 01:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding this
 
01:50:25.550 --> 01:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
this uh area that I I'm I'm discussing
 
01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
sure I think that's definitely the thing
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's going to have to be worked
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
through the most time will have to be
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
spent working through that my my
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
envisioning or My Hope Is that we would
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
pass the bill and then as in rule making
 
01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
bring all the stakeholders together or
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
maybe I mean you all could do that in a
 
01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee maybe as well but that we
 
01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
would bring all the stakeholders
 
01:50:49.390 --> 01:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
together um and submit comments for rule
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
making you know go through the whole rul
 
01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
making process and that that's where
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
that would be kind of hashed out okay
 
01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
thank you but I but I'd definitely thank
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
you for raising it yeah we have other
 
01:51:03.709 --> 01:51:03.719 align:start position:0%
folks that want to speak here we have a
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
whole lot of cards so uh thank you very
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
much for presenting the bill uh the next
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
be thank you for having me thank you
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
very much representa
 
01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:25.109 align:start position:0%
very much representa
Murray

01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record my
 
01:51:28.629 --> 01:51:28.639 align:start position:0%
name is Megan Murray I represent the
 
01:51:31.149 --> 01:51:31.159 align:start position:0%
town of Amherst Hillsboro District
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
22 I'm actually coming from a different
 
01:51:35.709 --> 01:51:35.719 align:start position:0%
perspective on this bill I'm not here
 
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
really to talk about the larger part of
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
the structure of the bill I'm talking
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
about this from an educational
 
01:51:44.109 --> 01:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
perspective and a parent sort of
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
perspective as well on behalf of my
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
community um so the bill presents
 
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
present enormous opportunities to
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
connect Learners teachers and families
 
01:51:57.550 --> 01:51:57.560 align:start position:0%
and communities to the agricultural
 
01:51:59.790 --> 01:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
Community nothing in this bill mandates
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
or directs the Department of Education
 
01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
districts or schools to implement any
 
01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
specific criteria or assessment around
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
food education but what the bill does do
 
01:52:11.310 --> 01:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
is serve as a jumping off point for New
 
01:52:12.990 --> 01:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire educational communities to
 
01:52:15.069 --> 01:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
make real world inquiry based
 
01:52:16.750 --> 01:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
connections and explorations to the
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
local food system and communities in
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
which students live
 
01:52:22.470 --> 01:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount of locally sourced
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
nutritional food on a child's lunch tray
 
01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
serves as an opportunity to begin
 
01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
talking about farming practices
 
01:52:32.109 --> 01:52:32.119 align:start position:0%
Agricultural Science Nutrition geography
 
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:33.800 align:start position:0%
and regionality of where our food comes
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
from and the importance of it though as
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
I said there is nothing prescriptive
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
about what the teaching Community must
 
01:52:41.950 --> 01:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
Implement here I do believe that our
 
01:52:43.629 --> 01:52:43.639 align:start position:0%
state has the opportunity to integrate
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
learning that provides real world
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
scenarios to meet educational goals and
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
standards the educ ational goals and
 
01:52:52.629 --> 01:52:52.639 align:start position:0%
standards of Learners today farming is
 
01:52:54.430 --> 01:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
no longer a process of just tilling the
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
ground sewing seeds and then harvesting
 
01:52:59.149 --> 01:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
a crop though that is the basic tenant
 
01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
farming touches all sorts of topics like
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
climate resiliency aquaculture
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
Hydroponics and many other
 
01:53:06.910 --> 01:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art growing practices that
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
require a high degree of Science
 
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
Education behind them I truly see the
 
01:53:13.069 --> 01:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
natural connection learning communities
 
01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
can make while simultaneously supporting
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
nutrient dense sourcing of foods locally
 
01:53:20.069 --> 01:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
and regionally New Hampshire has an
 
01:53:21.629 --> 01:53:21.639 align:start position:0%
entire network of small farms and
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
producers throughout the state the
 
01:53:25.390 --> 01:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
farming Community is vital to New
 
01:53:27.550 --> 01:53:27.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's food sourcing infrastructure
 
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
and we have seen that a well-
 
01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
diversified food infrastructure is vital
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
to a healthy food economy in New
 
01:53:35.310 --> 01:53:35.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there is no more appropriate
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
time to implement such an incentive as
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
now other Regional states have also done
 
01:53:42.430 --> 01:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
so within the last calendar year Vermont
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
being one of the most recent that I'm
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
aware of though New York and Montana I
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
believe have implemented it as
 
01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:50.589 align:start position:0%
believe have implemented it as
well

01:53:50.589 --> 01:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
as a parent this excites me because food
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
is such a vital component of who we are
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
in our families towns and in our
 
01:53:58.830 --> 01:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
communities to know that a child might
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
come home and say I tried a new
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
vegetable today I had K Robie um did you
 
01:54:07.069 --> 01:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
know that that only came four miles away
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
from where we are that's exciting um I
 
01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
urge the passage of HB 1657 to support

01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:29.639 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for offering
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to ask you a question
 
01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
sure I wonder if in
 
01:54:37.229 --> 01:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
your uh endeav it this way looking at
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
from education you've explored or
 
01:54:42.030 --> 01:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
considered the opportunity for pathway
 
01:54:44.229 --> 01:54:44.239 align:start position:0%
type programs through the high schools
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
to segue into the community colleges or
 
01:54:49.950 --> 01:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
whatever to get into this marketing
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
growthing knowledge of and therefore
 
01:54:55.149 --> 01:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
create career paths for people that they
 
01:54:57.550 --> 01:54:57.560 align:start position:0%
might not otherwise have considered
 
01:54:58.709 --> 01:54:58.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think
 
01:55:00.830 --> 01:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent point I think that
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
it's a really interesting um opportunity
 
01:55:06.149 --> 01:55:06.159 align:start position:0%
and as I said I think these are natural
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
um connections that might be made by
 
01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
districts and schools and even within
 
01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
the department if that is under their
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
purview but um I'm not here to mandate
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
that within the bill that's not the
 
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:20.719 align:start position:0%
nature of this bill but I see your point
 
01:55:22.830 --> 01:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
Thank you you're welcome thank you very
 
01:55:26.109 --> 01:55:26.119 align:start position:0%

1657 there are many people here today
 
01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
with a great deal of experience in the
 
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
practice of implementing a farm to
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
school reimbursement
 
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:08.040 align:start position:0%

local Growers who uh always rise to
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
being involved in their community
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
Hollis was established in

01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
Community it's a dee rooted part of our
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
heritage and our identity much like our
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
excellent schools so I wanted to be here
 
01:56:41.310 --> 01:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
today and I wanted to help sponsor this
 
01:56:43.709 --> 01:56:43.719 align:start position:0%
bill to say just a little bit about how
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
important it is to acknowledge that this
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
Farm to school program does more than
 
01:56:50.589 --> 01:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
bring local produce into our schools
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
it says we value the importance of New
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Rich farming tradition it
 
01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
says that resiliency of our communities
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
is steeped in how we use local resources
 
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
and how we work together for the greater
 
01:57:04.709 --> 01:57:04.719 align:start position:0%
good I know the owners of two of our
 
01:57:08.510 --> 01:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
major Farms David or of L farms and and
 
01:57:11.589 --> 01:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
Rick Hardy of Brookdale Fruit Farm
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
farmer Dave as he's known attended UNH
 
01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
Co-op and came away with such an
 
01:57:19.470 --> 01:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm for farming as a Young Man
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
that he convinced the owner of L Farm
 
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
who had no interest in continuing in the
 
01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
family business to lease the lands and
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
sell the building that make up his
 
01:57:30.030 --> 01:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
successful business uh several decades
 
01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
later but he has admitted to me that the
 
01:57:35.109 --> 01:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
family farming model is running up
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
against a lot of modern obstacles in
 
01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
recent years and he's had to continually
 
01:57:43.149 --> 01:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
innovate in order to keep um people
 
01:57:46.109 --> 01:57:46.119 align:start position:0%
stopping by his farm store as opposed to
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
shopping at a One-Stop shop like
 
01:57:50.910 --> 01:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
hanford's just down the street Rick
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
Hardy on the other hand of
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
Brookdale uh is a Seventh Generation
 
01:57:59.470 --> 01:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
farmer in Hollis and Beyond these two
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
men and their very different stories of
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
coming to toil the land Hollis is also
 
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
home to lvo Sullivans and just over one
 
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
of our borders Kimble
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
Farm like many other sectors of our
 
01:58:15.069 --> 01:58:15.079 align:start position:0%
economy family farming faces intense
 
01:58:16.830 --> 01:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
pressures in a modern
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
world making the margins to stay in the
 
01:58:22.350 --> 01:58:22.360 align:start position:0%
business of farming as a smallscale
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
grower gets trickier by the year whether
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
farmers are facing big box competitors
 
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
and their endless produce as others have
 
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
testified to already costly changes in
 
01:58:36.990 --> 01:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
farming practices and Regulatory burdens
 
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
or unpredictable crop patterns patterns
 
01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
a little tricky to say crop patterns uh
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
of drought Deluge or pests we should all
 
01:58:48.669 --> 01:58:48.679 align:start position:0%
be grateful for their commitment to keep
 
01:58:50.430 --> 01:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
the tradition of of our agricultural
 
01:58:53.069 --> 01:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
Heritage in our communities and we
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
should view H1
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
1657 as the kind of partnership that
 
01:59:00.189 --> 01:59:00.199 align:start position:0%
brings resiliency to our schools our
 
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
communities and to local
 
01:59:04.830 --> 01:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
agriculture the kind of resiliency we
 
01:59:07.229 --> 01:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
should want to support although the
 
01:59:09.669 --> 01:59:09.679 align:start position:0%
annual cap of 1,200 per school is not a
 
01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
huge amount of money it is the act of
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
generating the partnership and expanding
 
01:59:17.709 --> 01:59:17.719 align:start position:0%
local connections that strengthens our
 
01:59:20.189 --> 01:59:20.199 align:start position:0%
communities I'm very in favor of this
 
01:59:22.350 --> 01:59:22.360 align:start position:0%

01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.320 align:start position:0%

in business when we most need them at a
 
02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
time when climate change and economic
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
uncertainty suggest that we should be
 
02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
increasing Local Foods uh production New
 
02:00:42.430 --> 02:00:42.440 align:start position:0%

their lives to against large scale us
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
farms and even Farms Halfway Around the

World they need our help to stay
 
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
afloat at the same time New Hampshire
 
02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
schools are struggling to afford fresh
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
and nutritious meals for our
 
02:01:03.629 --> 02:01:03.639 align:start position:0%
children recent shortages have impacted
 
02:01:05.830 --> 02:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
School District's ability to purchase
 
02:01:08.910 --> 02:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
fresh produce items I can tell you my
 
02:01:10.669 --> 02:01:10.679 align:start position:0%
grandchild great great-grandchildren

school supplied nutritionally lacking
 
02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
snacks in their backpacks they just they

want to eat them and and to be honest
 
02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I want them to eat them uh
 
02:01:26.910 --> 02:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
Farm to school presents an opportunity
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
for us to help solve both
 
02:01:32.790 --> 02:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
problems selling to schools is a major
 
02:01:34.430 --> 02:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
market for local

lean time for
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
Farmers Financial stability is essential
 
02:01:56.149 --> 02:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
for keeping New Hampshire Farmers
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
farming and keeping their land safe from

development Farm to school also
 
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
strengthens the local

schools help keep dollars in the
 
02:02:13.149 --> 02:02:13.159 align:start position:0%
community and purchasing New Hampshire
 
02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
products contributes to our tax base
 
02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
which in turn funds our Public Schools
 
02:02:23.149 --> 02:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
finally the farm to school program helps
 
02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
students learn why local food is good

to speak up in suppor HB
 
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
1657 as someone who grew up in a farm
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
environment I learned in the early how
 
02:03:24.189 --> 02:03:24.199 align:start position:0%
to grow vegetables how to um be grateful
 
02:03:26.589 --> 02:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
to have the opportunity to see how hard
 
02:03:29.229 --> 02:03:29.239 align:start position:0%
it is to grow those vegetables and then
 
02:03:30.910 --> 02:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the hardware that comes
 
02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
to when you enjoy the vegetables and and
 
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
you you enjoy uh food from the Farms I'm
 
02:03:38.750 --> 02:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
here to support this bill because in my
 
02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:41.800 align:start position:0%
uh District um um I represent District
 
02:03:44.910 --> 02:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
23 in Milford we have a lot of farms and
 
02:03:47.229 --> 02:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
we already have some programs that um
 
02:03:49.390 --> 02:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
some restaurants already use and uh from
 
02:03:52.069 --> 02:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
the farm to the table and is helping uh
 
02:03:56.430 --> 02:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
F local farms uh with uh providing
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
vegetables and and nutritional things uh
 
02:04:03.390 --> 02:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
to for our um community so I believe
 
02:04:06.549 --> 02:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
this uh bill would a help not just to
 
02:04:09.310 --> 02:04:09.320 align:start position:0%
provide that uh and the economy
 
02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
incentive for a local farms to continue
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
doing what they doing but the schools to
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
bring better nutrition
 
02:04:20.189 --> 02:04:20.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh products to school system and that
 
02:04:22.709 --> 02:04:22.719 align:start position:0%
that can help with uh the kids to uh
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
have a better nutrition uh food in the
 
02:04:28.669 --> 02:04:28.679 align:start position:0%
table so I I I'm here just to support
 
02:04:30.109 --> 02:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
the bill because I believe this is
 
02:04:32.109 --> 02:04:32.119 align:start position:0%
something that we need and then when it
 
02:04:34.350 --> 02:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
comes to education I see I see the
 
02:04:36.750 --> 02:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
potential to be helping especially now
 
02:04:39.149 --> 02:04:39.159 align:start position:0%
that we try to get kids to learn um
 
02:04:42.149 --> 02:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
skills not just um going to University
 
02:04:44.069 --> 02:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
and college but a trade you know we have
 
02:04:46.589 --> 02:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of Trades that we can utilize if
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
we pass some of these bills especially
 
02:04:52.350 --> 02:04:52.360 align:start position:0%

and thank you uh represent Perez for
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
being here and I want to personalize
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
this a little bit and this is a question
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh I thought I just thought of and and I
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
hope everybody else will listen to this
 
02:05:12.430 --> 02:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
question and um I want to reference asle
 
02:05:14.270 --> 02:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
um our newest representative
 
02:05:17.629 --> 02:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
representative Hall uh and here's my
 
02:05:20.549 --> 02:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
question and it relates to uh towns that
 
02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
live on borders and uh representative
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
Hall actually comes from a farming
 
02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
family living right on the Connecticut
 
02:05:31.950 --> 02:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
River and the reason I mentioned this is
 
02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh the the Peasley Farm uh was just
 
02:05:37.790 --> 02:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
across basically across River from a
 
02:05:41.310 --> 02:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
representative Halls farm and so our
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
High School uh growon High School uh Is
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
On The Border there's a lot of
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
communities On the Border uh
 
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
representative lad the chairs
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
so my concern and my question suddenly
 
02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
is uh this bill is New Hampshire
 
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
specific and a community like Hollis or
 
02:06:00.030 --> 02:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
Milford Milford is fairly right in the
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
middle of the state so so to speak it's
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
not on the border so my concern and I I
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
don't know that you can answer this but
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
I want to put this out there is if an
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
existing or current a school that
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
currently has
 
02:06:18.149 --> 02:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
relationships um with farms uh just
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
across the river uh that that provide
 
02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
great produce and great
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
support uh If This Were to pass would
 
02:06:30.549 --> 02:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
this preclude uh gron High School from
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
buying uh potatoes from the Peasley Farm
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
just across the river in Vermont so
 
02:06:38.830 --> 02:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
that's my question for you and I hope
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sure others could hear it as well
 
02:06:45.310 --> 02:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
yeah to be honest this bill to me is not
 
02:06:47.790 --> 02:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
we not try to hurt um Farms that already
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
doing that with with the school systems
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
what we what I see from this bill is
 
02:06:55.790 --> 02:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
growing more opportunities especially
 
02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
helping the economy uh we see it uh
 
02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic a lot of the farms
 
02:07:02.430 --> 02:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
you know the last past two years that uh
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of the Farms they they help local
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
um schools by providing some of the
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
vegetables apples and things that they
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
had and I think we're not trying from
 
02:07:16.030 --> 02:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
what I'm seeing and and I I can be wrong
 
02:07:18.990 --> 02:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
but from what I'm seeing is we're not
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to take that away from
 
02:07:23.830 --> 02:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
the Farms already doing but we we wanted
 
02:07:26.270 --> 02:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
to see growing we want to see more Farms
 
02:07:28.350 --> 02:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
we want to see more products come into
 
02:07:30.430 --> 02:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
our school systems and then be more
 
02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
flexible and more available for the
 
02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:36.440 align:start position:0%

02:16:01.069 --> 02:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
eligible to apply schools Farms
 
02:16:04.270 --> 02:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
nonprofits um businesses anybody that
 
02:16:06.589 --> 02:16:06.599 align:start position:0%
wants to support a farm to school
 
02:16:10.109 --> 02:16:10.119 align:start position:0%
program um and so since that grant
 
02:16:11.589 --> 02:16:11.599 align:start position:0%
program was
 
02:16:15.030 --> 02:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
established um we've had numerous grants
 
02:16:17.910 --> 02:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
come into the state um totaling about
 
02:16:20.589 --> 02:16:20.599 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars um and so the
 
02:16:22.589 --> 02:16:22.599 align:start position:0%
grants were just due on Monday was the
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
deadline for this year's Farm to school
 
02:16:28.350 --> 02:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
grants so we've had four proposals go in
 
02:16:31.069 --> 02:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
um three from New Hampshire and then one
 
02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:38.429 --> 02:16:38.439 align:start position:0%
proposal thank you very much are there
 
02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
any for yes representative
 
02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
Richfield thank you chairman lad and
 
02:16:45.389 --> 02:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question a
 
02:16:46.910 --> 02:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
couple of questions that I have is if
 
02:16:48.389 --> 02:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing you correct correctly the
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
USDA already has some Grant programs
 
02:16:52.270 --> 02:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
that are out there that are not
 
02:16:55.389 --> 02:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily being taken advantage of um
 
02:16:56.910 --> 02:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
am I hearing you correctly well they
 
02:16:59.070 --> 02:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
have a farm to school grant program and
 
02:17:00.629 --> 02:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
the money is not to be used for the
 
02:17:02.549 --> 02:17:02.559 align:start position:0%
purchase of food that's not what the
 
02:17:05.190 --> 02:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
program is for it's for program
 
02:17:07.709 --> 02:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
activities to help support developing a
 
02:17:09.309 --> 02:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
plan of how you're going to purchase
 
02:17:11.910 --> 02:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
food of developing curriculum school
 
02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:13.030 align:start position:0%
food of developing curriculum school
garden

02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
garden
 
02:17:18.110 --> 02:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
programs um so it's it's the supportive
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
activities it's not for the purchase of
 
02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
food Mr chair follow
 
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
um May I follow up with two questions
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay um the next one is do you happen to
 
02:17:30.669 --> 02:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
know what the average Grant is per
 
02:17:35.309 --> 02:17:35.319 align:start position:0%
school or nonprofit um I would so
 
02:17:37.830 --> 02:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
they've just changed it so there are two
 
02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
tiers of Grant programs there's a
 
02:17:42.589 --> 02:17:42.599 align:start position:0%
planning Grant which is up to $50,000 in
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
one year and then there's a
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
implementation Grant uh which is a
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
two-year Grant and they' just changed it
 
02:17:52.750 --> 02:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
to be up to $500,000 it used to be at
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and we've had several entities
 
02:17:58.589 --> 02:17:58.599 align:start position:0%
in the state receive
 
02:18:01.349 --> 02:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um Nash School District Summers
 
02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
School District Portsmouth School
 
02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
District um uh and then this this year
 
02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
they just changed that amount so it's up
 
02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
to $500,000 for a two-year
 
02:18:14.950 --> 02:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
implementation Grant so go ahead um my
 
02:18:16.910 --> 02:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
question is and and hopefully you're the
 
02:18:18.910 --> 02:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
right person to ask ask but in in
 
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
listening to this just my interpretation
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
has been basically the schools maybe
 
02:18:25.629 --> 02:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
cannot afford this local fresh food
 
02:18:27.469 --> 02:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
right the Farmers can't necessarily
 
02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
afford um to sell the schools at the
 
02:18:31.709 --> 02:18:31.719 align:start position:0%
lower prices and we're looking to bridge
 
02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
this Gap um it looks to me as though the
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
bill is saying
 
02:18:38.549 --> 02:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
$600,000 which is a lot of money in a
 
02:18:40.509 --> 02:18:40.519 align:start position:0%
state budget but yet it looks to me as
 
02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
though when it's broken down per
 
02:18:43.309 --> 02:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
District it would be
 
02:18:47.230 --> 02:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
$1,200 I am I'm wondering does $1,200
 
02:18:49.589 --> 02:18:49.599 align:start position:0%
even make a significant difference as
 
02:18:51.389 --> 02:18:51.399 align:start position:0%
far as the food is concerned so it's
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
$1,200 per school so not school district
 
02:18:56.589 --> 02:18:56.599 align:start position:0%
per school so a large school district
 
02:18:58.870 --> 02:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
like Manchester that would has like 18
 
02:19:01.870 --> 02:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
schools it's $1,200 per School per
 
02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
school okay um and it can make a
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
significant difference um I mean school
 
02:19:11.910 --> 02:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
lunch funding is is difficult to to work
 
02:19:15.629 --> 02:19:15.639 align:start position:0%
with um to put a meal on a plate for
 
02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
maximum of a130
 
02:19:22.750 --> 02:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
um is hard um and so and a lot of
 
02:19:25.469 --> 02:19:25.479 align:start position:0%
schools food service programs run in the
 
02:19:28.309 --> 02:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
red um meaning they're losing
 
02:19:32.190 --> 02:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
money um so this would help their
 
02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:34.309 align:start position:0%
money um so this would help their
programs

02:19:34.309 --> 02:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:19:36.589 --> 02:19:36.599 align:start position:0%
um and of course helped our farming
 
02:19:39.309 --> 02:19:39.319 align:start position:0%
Community Mr chair May the last one I
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
promise that's the last question last
 
02:19:43.709 --> 02:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
question okay um I just want to clarify
 
02:19:46.150 --> 02:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
when you said the maximum of the dollar3
 
02:19:48.110 --> 02:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
I thought the federal reimburse was
 
02:19:51.469 --> 02:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
typically around $3 and $4 but it also
 
02:19:55.230 --> 02:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
has to cover labor a $3 reimbursement is
 
02:19:57.750 --> 02:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh not just for food it's for labor and
 
02:19:59.469 --> 02:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
other requirements of a school Food
 
02:20:03.389 --> 02:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
Service program like napkins or Forks um
 
02:20:08.030 --> 02:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
so the national figure is that 45 you
 
02:20:10.110 --> 02:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
know 45 cents for every dollar gets
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
spent on
 
02:20:16.030 --> 02:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
food um but yeah so a $3 reimbursement
 
02:20:18.429 --> 02:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
per meal it's got to cover labor and
 
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
food and all the
 
02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
other expenses related to school food
 
02:20:27.670 --> 02:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
service thank you uh any further
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
questions and we have our last uh
 
02:20:36.349 --> 02:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:40.190 --> 02:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
me uh I don't see the commissioner I
 
02:20:42.990 --> 02:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
Jasper's not here but uh you're talking
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:48.910 --> 02:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
agriculture and we also have M McKenzie
 
02:20:52.389 --> 02:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
snow here from the Department nut with
 
02:20:55.349 --> 02:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
the nutrition person so that's
 
02:20:58.910 --> 02:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
doe yeah this is probably more
 
02:21:00.830 --> 02:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate this is probably more an
 
02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate witness then for my question
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
if I could ask one more one question of
 
02:21:07.469 --> 02:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
this witness please just go ahead thank
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
you um so one of the things that we
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
heard in the earlier testimony is that
 
02:21:16.150 --> 02:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of for Farms on the border
 
02:21:18.429 --> 02:21:18.439 align:start position:0%
and this bill sets up two tiers it sets
 
02:21:20.110 --> 02:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
up tier one for New Hampshire farms and
 
02:21:22.110 --> 02:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
Tier Two For the Rest of New England and
 
02:21:23.870 --> 02:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it makes sense to
 
02:21:26.429 --> 02:21:26.439 align:start position:0%
expand the definition of tier one to New
 
02:21:28.510 --> 02:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farms or anything within 25
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
miles of the New Hampshire border um to
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
accommodate the fact that we've got all
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
these border Farms that really should be
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
a supplying the Border schools and I'm
 
02:21:39.790 --> 02:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if that works from your point
 
02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:40.630 align:start position:0%
wondering if that works from your point
of

02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
view it works for my point of view if
 
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know if this bill passes we'll
 
02:21:49.309 --> 02:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
certainly certainly consider that thank
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
you very much because we do have this
 
02:21:52.870 --> 02:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
school districts that go on both sides
 
02:21:55.630 --> 02:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
of the Border yes I know yeah and we we
 
02:21:58.590 --> 02:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
have uh yeah a number of states where
 
02:22:00.910 --> 02:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
fact in my community if you're an AB
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
budding Community to havil even if
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
you're on the other side of the river
 
02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
you get to bid on jobs at the same level
 
02:22:10.349 --> 02:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
that local bids are given out so we
 
02:22:14.190 --> 02:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
consider that area as one region one
 
02:22:16.670 --> 02:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
Community fact our school buses go B
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
both sides the r River so okay we have
 
02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:21.560 align:start position:0%

200 students to find out their opinions

contained fresh fruits and vegetables

02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
specific questions for the department at
 
02:26:04.630 --> 02:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
this time yes yes represent cordelli
 
02:26:08.990 --> 02:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um I had questions about the
 
02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh the fiscal note and uh the funding um
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
the uh bill specifies um 600,00
 
02:26:20.349 --> 02:26:20.359 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:26:25.150 --> 02:26:25.160 align:start position:0%
2023 uh year um and it specifies on page
 
02:26:29.269 --> 02:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
two that 40,000 of that is for um
 
02:26:31.309 --> 02:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
Information Systems
 
02:26:36.110 --> 02:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
use uh and set up um but uh there's also
 
02:26:41.550 --> 02:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
an indication of staffing needs in um
 
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
the area of
 
02:26:47.349 --> 02:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
$180,000 for 2023 and Beyond um would
 
02:26:50.670 --> 02:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
that be uh in addition to the
 
02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
$600,000 so the the real cost is more uh
 
02:26:57.030 --> 02:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
in the area of $780,000
 
02:27:00.429 --> 02:27:00.439 align:start position:0%
that's correct representative so we we
 
02:27:04.750 --> 02:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
um anticipate a significant need to
 
02:27:07.710 --> 02:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
accommodate for new transactions in our
 
02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
food nutrition um information technology
 
02:27:14.670 --> 02:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
system which is funded at $40,000 but to
 
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that we are able to provide appr
 
02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
at technical assistance and training to
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
the field monitoring the field to
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
develop um new processes and procedures
 
02:27:27.070 --> 02:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
for the submission of reimbursements the
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
verification of that the provision of
 
02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursements um for verifying the
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
place of origin we do anticipate that
 
02:27:36.750 --> 02:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
two new full-time staff would be
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
required thank you yes followup yes um
 
02:27:43.150 --> 02:27:43.160 align:start position:0%
yes I was wondering also
 
02:27:45.790 --> 02:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
if we've had some discussion about the
 
02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:47.230 align:start position:0%
if we've had some discussion about the
tiers

02:27:47.230 --> 02:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
tiers
 
02:27:49.469 --> 02:27:49.479 align:start position:0%
and um you know where the farm is
 
02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
located and who it's owned by and so
 
02:27:54.230 --> 02:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
forth do you see problems in the current
 
02:27:57.070 --> 02:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
bill with the Department ter
 
02:27:59.790 --> 02:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
determining um who qualifies for what
 
02:28:02.190 --> 02:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
kind of reimbursement so our
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the place of
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
origin is uh via self attestation um
 
02:28:07.710 --> 02:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
that would be something that would be
 
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
included in our monitoring it is not
 
02:28:11.630 --> 02:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
something that the department has done
 
02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
or has experienced doing and would
 
02:28:16.150 --> 02:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
require significant staff capacity to be
 
02:28:17.870 --> 02:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
able to take up that
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility thank you further
 
02:28:23.349 --> 02:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
questions of the department yes uh
 
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative Ford and then represent
 
02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
B thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
for coming for questions um the question
 
02:28:35.190 --> 02:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
I have is with increasing numbers of
 
02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
students getting shall we say their only
 
02:28:41.230 --> 02:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
or their primary food at the school
 
02:28:43.630 --> 02:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
through the school's lunch program what
 
02:28:45.630 --> 02:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
do you see as this kind of thing what
 
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
kind of impact do you you see having on
 
02:28:50.469 --> 02:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
addressing this problem having on
 
02:28:53.950 --> 02:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
addressing uh that need and which may
 
02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:55.710 align:start position:0%
addressing uh that need and which may
continue

02:28:55.710 --> 02:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
continue
 
02:28:58.110 --> 02:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately so if I understand the
 
02:29:00.870 --> 02:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
question correctly um this is limited to
 
02:29:02.550 --> 02:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
those current participants in the
 
02:29:04.630 --> 02:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
national school lunch program so it is
 
02:29:07.870 --> 02:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
not so much expanding access to um
 
02:29:11.469 --> 02:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
School provided lunches but uh incenting
 
02:29:14.349 --> 02:29:14.359 align:start position:0%
uh and reimbursing for those locally
 
02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
sourced vendors but it might then
 
02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
thereby have an improvement of the
 
02:29:20.870 --> 02:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
quality that they're able to offer
 
02:29:23.309 --> 02:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
because they can access fresh vegetables
 
02:29:27.630 --> 02:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
and so forth uh as part of this program
 
02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
potentially thank you represent B thank
 
02:29:33.309 --> 02:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking the
 
02:29:33.319 --> 02:29:34.990 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking the
question

02:29:34.990 --> 02:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:29:39.030 --> 02:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
um mentioned before about USDA grants is
 
02:29:41.710 --> 02:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
there any way the state can apply for
 
02:29:44.510 --> 02:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
those grants at the state level to do
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
this program so we currently participate
 
02:29:50.670 --> 02:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
in the national school lunch program um
 
02:29:52.389 --> 02:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
and that's what was referenced earlier
 
02:29:55.910 --> 02:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
that uh this uh new program proposed in
 
02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
the bill uh would be limited to those
 
02:30:01.030 --> 02:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
participants in a uh reimbursement or
 
02:30:05.190 --> 02:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
grant program in which we uh currently
 
02:30:07.309 --> 02:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
participate thank you very much are
 
02:30:09.790 --> 02:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
there any further questions not seeing
 
02:30:11.630 --> 02:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you if and if
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
I just may I want to draw attention to
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
one additional piece do you mind
 
02:30:18.110 --> 02:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
chairman quickly quickly um so in
 
02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
addition to the new staff I just want to
 
02:30:21.230 --> 02:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
draw attention to the feasibility of the
 
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
implementation timeline so it says
 
02:30:26.469 --> 02:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
summer of 2022 it would take um that
 
02:30:29.030 --> 02:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
implementation timeline is unfeasible uh
 
02:30:31.990 --> 02:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
in order for us to recruit higher and uh
 
02:30:34.110 --> 02:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
Ru out a new program so thank you for
 
02:30:35.710 --> 02:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
your consideration of that important
 
02:30:39.110 --> 02:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
piece of technical assistance thank you
 
02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
not seeing any more people uh that have
 
02:30:44.590 --> 02:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
submitted cards we're going to close
 
02:30:44.600 --> 02:30:45.429 align:start position:0%
submitted cards we're going to close
this

02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%

lot of
 
02:32:03.070 --> 02:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
questions is it one year I don't know if
 
02:32:05.590 --> 02:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's permanent or not and how does the

02:33:15.160 --> 02:33:41.150 align:start position:0%
 
question

02:33:41.150 --> 02:33:41.160 align:start position:0%

House Bill one uh 1655 a bill relative
 
02:34:04.990 --> 02:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
to the natural immunity system health
 
02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
and wellness curriculum in schools could
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
you excuse me for a sec could you put
 
02:34:10.870 --> 02:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
that mic right up the uh so we can hear

of hearing so I speak loud usually so
 
02:34:19.269 --> 02:34:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:20.910 --> 02:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me those in the back of the room
 
02:34:22.389 --> 02:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
if you want to take your conversation in

here thank you go ahead thank you six uh
 
02:34:35.389 --> 02:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1655 seeks to ensure that all
 
02:34:37.269 --> 02:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students shall learn how
 
02:34:39.469 --> 02:34:39.479 align:start position:0%
to strengthen and maintain their body's
 
02:34:42.349 --> 02:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
immune systems through diet nutrition
 
02:34:44.590 --> 02:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
vitamins dietary supplements and
 
02:34:46.389 --> 02:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
physical activities as a mean means of
 
02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
increasing their body's natural
 
02:34:51.190 --> 02:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
protection and immunity against
 
02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:53.640 align:start position:0%
disease it sensibly seeks to gather
 
02:34:56.389 --> 02:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
experts in the field of natural
 
02:34:58.510 --> 02:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
autoimmune system health and wellness
 
02:35:00.349 --> 02:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
and allow them to craft a statewise
 
02:35:02.830 --> 02:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum that can be included in our
 
02:35:04.110 --> 02:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
current health
 
02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
classes it also seeks to establish a
 
02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide advisor in the Department of
 
02:35:11.469 --> 02:35:11.479 align:start position:0%
Education to act as a centralized
 
02:35:13.550 --> 02:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
resource and Champion for the new
 
02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum while I am generally not a
 
02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
big fan of expanding government in this
 
02:35:19.230 --> 02:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
case I feel having someone to oversee
 
02:35:21.469 --> 02:35:21.479 align:start position:0%
standardize and promote this curriculum
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
at least initially would be a prudent
 
02:35:25.269 --> 02:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
investment of tax
 
02:35:28.429 --> 02:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
dollar the bill seeks to
 
02:35:31.230 --> 02:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
create curriculum which specifically
 
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
identifies the critical role proper diet
 
02:35:36.070 --> 02:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
nutrition and exercise play in
 
02:35:38.190 --> 02:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
increasing autoimmune defenses and
 
02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
reducing many of the conditions related
 
02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
to comorbidity in a wide variety of
 
02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:44.349 align:start position:0%
to comorbidity in a wide variety of
pathogenic

02:35:44.349 --> 02:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
pathogenic
 
02:35:47.710 --> 02:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
diseases I realized that we have current
 
02:35:49.670 --> 02:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
health curriculum but I seek a
 
02:35:52.269 --> 02:35:52.279 align:start position:0%
complimentary curriculum that stresses
 
02:35:53.750 --> 02:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
to our children the benefits and
 
02:35:56.190 --> 02:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
importance of developing and maintaining
 
02:35:59.670 --> 02:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
a good immune uh good immune system
 
02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
Health in the coming post pandemic age
 
02:36:05.469 --> 02:36:05.479 align:start position:0%
by teaching our children this criteria
 
02:36:07.110 --> 02:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
we can reduce their chances of
 
02:36:09.790 --> 02:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
Contracting disease reduce the severity
 
02:36:11.950 --> 02:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
of symptoms from disease if they do
 
02:36:14.429 --> 02:36:14.439 align:start position:0%
contract them reduce their need for
 
02:36:17.190 --> 02:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
hospitalization or intens of care as
 
02:36:19.429 --> 02:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
well as helping them avoid conditions
 
02:36:21.830 --> 02:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
that result in
 
02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
comorbidity including this in our school
 
02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
curriculum not only has the potential to
 
02:36:27.710 --> 02:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
strengthen and protect our individual
 
02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
students but also to develop stronger
 
02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
communities and a stronger State I ask
 
02:36:35.150 --> 02:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
you for support of this legislation and
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
we'll try my best to answer any
 
02:36:38.469 --> 02:36:38.479 align:start position:0%
questions you may have thank thank you
 
02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:39.680 align:start position:0%

likeus I'm trying to understand do you
 
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
want this to be added to What's Done in
 
02:36:50.469 --> 02:36:50.479 align:start position:0%
health now or do you want this to be in
 
02:36:53.429 --> 02:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
addition to What's Done in health
 
02:36:56.510 --> 02:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
now um my initial intent was to have it
 
02:36:58.590 --> 02:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
added to what's what's to be done in
 
02:37:00.710 --> 02:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
health now thank
 
02:37:02.830 --> 02:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
you forther question representative
 
02:37:05.469 --> 02:37:05.479 align:start position:0%
Porter thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:37:07.910 --> 02:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative um I know that there's
 
02:37:07.920 --> 02:37:08.990 align:start position:0%
representative um I know that there's
some

02:37:08.990 --> 02:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:37:11.150 --> 02:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
controversial controversy in the
 
02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
scientific Community concerning um the
 
02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
real benefits of vit and dietary
 
02:37:19.389 --> 02:37:19.399 align:start position:0%
supplements and I'm wondering if that
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
will present a conflict um
 
02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
scientifically if it's included in our
 
02:37:28.110 --> 02:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
curriculum if we're including in our
 
02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
curriculum items that are perhaps not
 
02:37:33.190 --> 02:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
scientifically as sound as we would like
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:38.590 --> 02:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
be thank you for your
 
02:37:42.110 --> 02:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
question um in the research I've done in
 
02:37:44.590 --> 02:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
what I've looked at I haven't found any
 
02:37:48.590 --> 02:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
um anyone that's saying that a person
 
02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:49.429 align:start position:0%
um anyone that's saying that a person
that

02:37:49.429 --> 02:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:37:49.439 --> 02:37:52.110 align:start position:0%
that
has

02:37:52.110 --> 02:37:52.120 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:37:55.590 --> 02:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
um poor immune system health or a person
 
02:38:00.429 --> 02:38:00.439 align:start position:0%
that has comorbid morbidities is um at
 
02:38:02.790 --> 02:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
the same level as someone who has good
 
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
immune system health and no
 
02:38:08.110 --> 02:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
comorbidities as far as dealing with
 
02:38:10.630 --> 02:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
diseases go
 
02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:13.389 align:start position:0%
diseases go
so

02:38:13.389 --> 02:38:13.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:38:16.349 --> 02:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
um with that in mind
 
02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
if we know that there are are are things
 
02:38:21.070 --> 02:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
that we can do in other words we know
 
02:38:24.389 --> 02:38:24.399 align:start position:0%
that a good diet uh good
 
02:38:27.990 --> 02:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
nutrition and um exercise help to
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
strengthen the immune system and we know
 
02:38:32.389 --> 02:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
that a person with a strong immune
 
02:38:35.469 --> 02:38:35.479 align:start position:0%
system um has a better chance of dealing
 
02:38:37.469 --> 02:38:37.479 align:start position:0%
with diseases all of them not just one
 
02:38:37.479 --> 02:38:38.670 align:start position:0%
with diseases all of them not just one
specific

02:38:38.670 --> 02:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:40.190 align:start position:0%
specific
one

02:38:40.190 --> 02:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:38:43.630 --> 02:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
um I can't see why that would be a an
 
02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
issue or a problem
 
02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
can I have a followup Mr chair yes yes
 
02:38:51.389 --> 02:38:51.399 align:start position:0%
you may thank you I guess that's not the
 
02:38:53.550 --> 02:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
area of the curriculum that I'm
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
concerned with um I have also done
 
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
research and I know there are many
 
02:39:01.510 --> 02:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
dietary supplements for example I see
 
02:39:03.469 --> 02:39:03.479 align:start position:0%
them advertised all the time that if I
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
took this pill once a day I would
 
02:39:10.110 --> 02:39:10.120 align:start position:0%
suddenly lose 40 pounds um that a lot of
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
those dietary supplements and vitamins
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
are making claims that are not
 
02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:16.190 align:start position:0%
are making claims that are not
scientifically

02:39:16.190 --> 02:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
scientifically
 
02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
proven um
 
02:39:23.830 --> 02:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm worried about teaching our kids
 
02:39:26.990 --> 02:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
that something will help them when there
 
02:39:32.230 --> 02:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
is not scientific fact behind
 
02:39:35.429 --> 02:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
that to prove that it is accurate we
 
02:39:38.269 --> 02:39:38.279 align:start position:0%
know vitamin C helps us do we really
 
02:39:41.469 --> 02:39:41.479 align:start position:0%
know if eishia helps us we don't know
 
02:39:41.479 --> 02:39:44.309 align:start position:0%
know if eishia helps us we don't know
for

02:39:44.309 --> 02:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:46.870 --> 02:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
sure thank you I have the same concerns
 
02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:48.230 align:start position:0%
sure thank you I have the same concerns
actually

02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:39:51.030 --> 02:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm not a
 
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
doctor um I'm not a nutrition list I was
 
02:39:55.840 --> 02:39:57.269 align:start position:0%
doctor um I'm not a nutrition list I was
taught

02:39:57.269 --> 02:39:57.279 align:start position:0%
taught
 
02:40:00.750 --> 02:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
that a good diet good nutrition and
 
02:40:04.190 --> 02:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
exercise help make you healthier and if
 
02:40:05.870 --> 02:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
you're healthy you tend to be able to
 
02:40:07.469 --> 02:40:07.479 align:start position:0%
respond better to
 
02:40:12.110 --> 02:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
diseases um there are quite a few papers
 
02:40:17.389 --> 02:40:17.399 align:start position:0%
specifically on the increase of of
 
02:40:21.870 --> 02:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
um of your symptoms when you do get sick
 
02:40:25.309 --> 02:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
if you have malnutrition or a lack of
 
02:40:28.030 --> 02:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
vitamins or diseases all I'm looking for
 
02:40:29.830 --> 02:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
is to teach our
 
02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:31.429 align:start position:0%
is to teach our
children

02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
what a good diet is what good nutrition
 
02:40:37.269 --> 02:40:37.279 align:start position:0%
is and how that impacts them from an
 
02:40:37.279 --> 02:40:38.550 align:start position:0%
is and how that impacts them from an
immunity

02:40:38.550 --> 02:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
02:40:41.429 --> 02:40:41.439 align:start position:0%
standpoint I think this is a a huge
 
02:40:43.870 --> 02:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity it's the one area that we
 
02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
can actually have an effect on any
 
02:40:49.030 --> 02:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
disease coming at us in the future and
 
02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm really looking to try to um
 
02:40:55.269 --> 02:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
promote that in our schools if we can
 
02:40:57.990 --> 02:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
get our children to understand that and
 
02:41:00.150 --> 02:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
to reduce the number of comorbidities
 
02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
they develop as they grow older this
 
02:41:03.830 --> 02:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
will provide us with a stronger
 
02:41:05.349 --> 02:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
community that can deal better with
 
02:41:07.150 --> 02:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
diseases as they come
 
02:41:10.990 --> 02:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
along further questions represent
 
02:41:13.550 --> 02:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
represent bow then represent
 
02:41:16.030 --> 02:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you Mr chairman
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh than taking the question you know the
 
02:41:21.429 --> 02:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh since you know I'll explain it the
 
02:41:24.550 --> 02:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
state constitution says if we mandate
 
02:41:26.389 --> 02:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
something we have to pay for it the
 
02:41:28.630 --> 02:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
state pays for it so don't you see this
 
02:41:30.550 --> 02:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
as a 28a
 
02:41:34.389 --> 02:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
issue for local school
 
02:41:37.230 --> 02:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
districts that they have to pay for it
 
02:41:40.469 --> 02:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
without and the con Us New Hampshire
 
02:41:42.910 --> 02:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution says if we mandate it we
 
02:41:44.429 --> 02:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
02:41:44.439 --> 02:41:48.230 align:start position:0%
pay for
it

02:41:48.230 --> 02:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're already teaching Health in our
 
02:41:53.429 --> 02:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
schools um this would be an addition to
 
02:41:56.190 --> 02:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
a curriculum that already
 
02:41:59.870 --> 02:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
exists um the additional cost there is a
 
02:42:02.710 --> 02:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
there was a fiscal note attached there
 
02:42:06.030 --> 02:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
would be additional cost to it um some
 
02:42:08.190 --> 02:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
additional cost to
 
02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:10.590 align:start position:0%
additional cost to
it

02:42:10.590 --> 02:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:42:14.030 --> 02:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
the the costs that are
 
02:42:16.510 --> 02:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
there um
 
02:42:19.230 --> 02:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
would need to be budgeted for
 
02:42:23.590 --> 02:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
certain so I I'm thinking that I don't
 
02:42:26.990 --> 02:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
see it as a if it's done at the state
 
02:42:29.349 --> 02:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
level the curriculum is developed at the
 
02:42:33.429 --> 02:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
state level I don't see it as a a a a
 
02:42:38.429 --> 02:42:38.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:41.150 --> 02:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question thank you
 
02:42:42.349 --> 02:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you representative l good
 
02:42:48.630 --> 02:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon almost good afternoon good
 
02:42:50.790 --> 02:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
late M I guess a couple questions if I
 
02:42:52.830 --> 02:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
may two or two different areas in the
 
02:42:55.429 --> 02:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
bill you talking about all public and
 
02:42:57.950 --> 02:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
private schools um what are you
 
02:42:59.230 --> 02:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
specifically talking about in terms of
 
02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:05.190 align:start position:0%
specifically talking about in terms of
private

02:43:05.190 --> 02:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:07.590 --> 02:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
schools what I'm trying to do is get a
 
02:43:11.349 --> 02:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
Statewide curriculum on on uh immune
 
02:43:11.359 --> 02:43:12.429 align:start position:0%
Statewide curriculum on on uh immune
system

02:43:12.429 --> 02:43:12.439 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
Health um and that that the the state
 
02:43:17.870 --> 02:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
would provide the you know material and
 
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum for the private schools I I
 
02:43:22.389 --> 02:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
know that as PRI with private schools
 
02:43:24.269 --> 02:43:24.279 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
02:43:28.269 --> 02:43:28.279 align:start position:0%
um you you can't demand that they have
 
02:43:30.110 --> 02:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
that curriculum but we could provide
 
02:43:34.230 --> 02:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
them with the information for it so from
 
02:43:35.830 --> 02:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
a from a dollar standpoint they they
 
02:43:37.790 --> 02:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
were just using they be accessing our
 
02:43:42.389 --> 02:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:44.309 --> 02:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
schools we would be providing
 
02:43:46.710 --> 02:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
information for them okay from from the
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
second part you you you commented more
 
02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
generically in in the curricula you
 
02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
commented that your your intent uh was
 
02:43:56.190 --> 02:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
to provide a a good diet and good
 
02:43:58.110 --> 02:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
nutrition for imunity for youngsters in
 
02:44:00.269 --> 02:44:00.279 align:start position:0%
the schools that could found
 
02:44:02.110 --> 02:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
foundational base for them to move on in
 
02:44:05.670 --> 02:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that those types
 
02:44:11.670 --> 02:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
of issues are currently discussed in
 
02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
health and wellness programs in our
 
02:44:16.590 --> 02:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
curriculums um in all our high schools
 
02:44:18.429 --> 02:44:18.439 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure K to8 but in all our high
 
02:44:20.230 --> 02:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
school curriculum that's already
 
02:44:24.110 --> 02:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
happening um maybe not to the particular
 
02:44:26.349 --> 02:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
points of interest that you identify but
 
02:44:29.790 --> 02:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
by trained uh teachers who are certified
 
02:44:32.269 --> 02:44:32.279 align:start position:0%
in health and fizzed and nutrition so I
 
02:44:35.269 --> 02:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
I don't I I guess the problem I I like
 
02:44:36.429 --> 02:44:36.439 align:start position:0%
what you're saying in terms of what
 
02:44:38.070 --> 02:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be done I think a lot of that
 
02:44:39.230 --> 02:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
is already being done by the
 
02:44:40.590 --> 02:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
professionals are teaching in the school
 
02:44:43.309 --> 02:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
every day um and and my my dollar
 
02:44:45.469 --> 02:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
concern is different than repr restive
 
02:44:47.110 --> 02:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
across the hall over there my dollar
 
02:44:48.510 --> 02:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
concern is we're talking about a quar
 
02:44:51.870 --> 02:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year for doe to to
 
02:44:54.510 --> 02:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
create a curriculum or higher specialist
 
02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
in nutrition uh when we already have all
 
02:44:59.150 --> 02:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
local schools have people doing that
 
02:45:01.309 --> 02:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
that I guess that's my point I don't
 
02:45:02.750 --> 02:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
sure it's a point of a question but I
 
02:45:04.670 --> 02:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
just wonder why we we want to invest a
 
02:45:06.910 --> 02:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
quarter million dollars for doe to do
 
02:45:08.950 --> 02:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
that to hire the person when the schools
 
02:45:10.110 --> 02:45:10.120 align:start position:0%
are already having that in the health
 
02:45:11.590 --> 02:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
and wellness
 
02:45:13.309 --> 02:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
curriculums well I agree that the
 
02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
schools already have that as a health
 
02:45:17.550 --> 02:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
and and wellness curriculum but I'm also
 
02:45:21.269 --> 02:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
seeing um data end reports that indicate
 
02:45:25.309 --> 02:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
that that there is um undernutrition
 
02:45:28.590 --> 02:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
malnutrition within with children uh so
 
02:45:30.870 --> 02:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how effective it's being
 
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
and and I think that um we need
 
02:45:37.950 --> 02:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
to stress this from a immune system
 
02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint considering what we've gone
 
02:45:43.150 --> 02:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
through in the last two years so I I'm
 
02:45:46.190 --> 02:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'm trying to do is
 
02:45:50.790 --> 02:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
to um increase the promotion of good
 
02:45:53.269 --> 02:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
health and wellness within our school
 
02:45:55.710 --> 02:45:55.720 align:start position:0%
systems thank you repres thank you thank
 
02:45:58.030 --> 02:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Tanner you had
 
02:46:01.429 --> 02:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
your hand up I believe thank you um just
 
02:46:03.790 --> 02:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
as a disclaimer I'm a professional
 
02:46:06.630 --> 02:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
health and physical education teacher
 
02:46:10.349 --> 02:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
and um it is taught in the schools uh
 
02:46:13.950 --> 02:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
it's um taught nutrition is taught and
 
02:46:16.910 --> 02:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
also physical fitness is taught um and
 
02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
wellness is taught and um it's very
 
02:46:23.710 --> 02:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
difficult uh to approach what you're
 
02:46:26.389 --> 02:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
trying to approach I think and seeing
 
02:46:29.630 --> 02:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
immediate results have you considered
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
for example working with the snap
 
02:46:35.950 --> 02:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
program the food nutrition program for
 
02:46:40.110 --> 02:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
uh giving to Poverty to uh areas of
 
02:46:42.150 --> 02:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
places where children can't get enough
 
02:46:45.349 --> 02:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
food I know one school district in my
 
02:46:48.990 --> 02:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
area has a backpack program because they
 
02:46:52.309 --> 02:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
found that kids who have uh limited
 
02:46:54.790 --> 02:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
access to food at home weren't getting
 
02:46:57.550 --> 02:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
food on the weekends adequate nutrition
 
02:46:59.309 --> 02:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
and weren't getting adequate nutrition
 
02:47:01.710 --> 02:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
over vacations and weren't getting
 
02:47:04.990 --> 02:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
adequate nutritions up until this last
 
02:47:07.110 --> 02:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh couple of years where schools have
 
02:47:09.349 --> 02:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
actually taken to providing lunches and
 
02:47:13.389 --> 02:47:13.399 align:start position:0%
breakfast uh and food to to all students
 
02:47:15.510 --> 02:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
um the nutrition wasn't there
 
02:47:18.510 --> 02:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
so you know the curriculum is usually
 
02:47:21.550 --> 02:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
developed at the local level and I think
 
02:47:25.309 --> 02:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh it would be I was wondering if or how
 
02:47:29.469 --> 02:47:29.479 align:start position:0%
much you time you had spent actually
 
02:47:31.790 --> 02:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
with the wellness department at the
 
02:47:33.230 --> 02:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
State Department of Education the
 
02:47:33.240 --> 02:47:34.309 align:start position:0%
State Department of Education the
wellness

02:47:34.309 --> 02:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
wellness
 
02:47:36.590 --> 02:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
coordinator as well as maybe your local
 
02:47:39.190 --> 02:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
school district to see what is in the
 
02:47:41.429 --> 02:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
curriculum and what kind of nutritional
 
02:47:43.590 --> 02:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
benefits they're offering right from the
 
02:47:45.469 --> 02:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
school that would address the problem
 
02:47:48.230 --> 02:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
that uh you seem to be trying to address
 
02:47:52.190 --> 02:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
here I I agree immunity system is you
 
02:47:54.950 --> 02:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
know that's our first line of
 
02:47:57.429 --> 02:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
defense thank thank you very thank you
 
02:47:59.150 --> 02:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
very much are there any further
 
02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:16.190 align:start position:0%

02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:18.150 align:start position:0%
Ellison
indic

02:48:18.150 --> 02:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
indic
 
02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:20.750 align:start position:0%
indic
that

02:48:20.750 --> 02:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:48:23.110 --> 02:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
legislation funding part would go to
 
02:48:26.070 --> 02:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
finance well you you've looked at a part
 
02:48:28.190 --> 02:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
that I've also looked at first of all
 
02:48:32.269 --> 02:48:32.279 align:start position:0%
the effective date is uh conflicts with
 
02:48:36.190 --> 02:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note in terms of uh affected
 
02:48:38.349 --> 02:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
date 60 days after
 
02:48:40.590 --> 02:48:40.600 align:start position:0%
passage and then you're talking about
 
02:48:43.269 --> 02:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
these expenditure needs to make this
 
02:48:45.710 --> 02:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
program work so the something has to be
 
02:48:48.950 --> 02:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
changed here and uh most likely the
 
02:48:51.510 --> 02:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
effective date uh curriculum doesn't
 
02:48:53.110 --> 02:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
happen that
 
02:48:55.510 --> 02:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
quickly and I think you have a very
 
02:48:55.520 --> 02:48:56.550 align:start position:0%
quickly and I think you have a very
excellent

02:48:56.550 --> 02:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
02:48:56.560 --> 02:49:01.990 align:start position:0%
excellent
point

02:49:01.990 --> 02:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:04.389 --> 02:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
concern another committee that's why
 
02:49:06.550 --> 02:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
this is an early bill it would have to
 
02:49:08.990 --> 02:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
go to a second committee and that fisal
 
02:49:11.990 --> 02:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
note would certainly be looked at um and
 
02:49:13.750 --> 02:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the effective date of the bill
 
02:49:15.870 --> 02:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
would also be looked at
 
02:49:18.590 --> 02:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
that yeah thank you you're
 
02:49:20.830 --> 02:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
welcome any further questions yes
 
02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:21.990 align:start position:0%
welcome any further questions yes
represent

02:49:21.990 --> 02:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:49:25.309 --> 02:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
lakus I'm not sure if you're the one to
 
02:49:28.190 --> 02:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
ask this or if the doe is the one to ask
 
02:49:30.830 --> 02:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
this I'm wondering if you know why they
 
02:49:32.910 --> 02:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
feel like they have to have a person
 
02:49:35.710 --> 02:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
there all these additional years once
 
02:49:40.830 --> 02:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:43.309 --> 02:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
curriculum um I'm probably the person to
 
02:49:47.550 --> 02:49:47.560 align:start position:0%
ask this and this is this was um this is
 
02:49:49.150 --> 02:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
the first bill I'm presenting in front
 
02:49:53.510 --> 02:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
of committee This was um the my seventh
 
02:49:57.190 --> 02:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
LSR of the year um it came to me from
 
02:49:59.309 --> 02:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
one of the the people in my district had
 
02:50:01.229 --> 02:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
the IDE you know had an idea they wanted
 
02:50:03.750 --> 02:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
me to try to do something about it so I
 
02:50:06.229 --> 02:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
sat down with them I worked with them um
 
02:50:08.429 --> 02:50:08.439 align:start position:0%
I tried to talk you know I I worked with
 
02:50:10.150 --> 02:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh legislative services and tried to
 
02:50:13.830 --> 02:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
talk to them um there are issues with
 
02:50:15.750 --> 02:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
this bill that I know of there is a
 
02:50:17.910 --> 02:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
misspelling in the bill that both I and
 
02:50:21.349 --> 02:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
and legisl legislative Services missed
 
02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
um I got this bill late coming out of
 
02:50:25.309 --> 02:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
legislative Services did the best I
 
02:50:28.630 --> 02:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
could with you know dealing with it but
 
02:50:31.590 --> 02:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
um I put the language in there and and
 
02:50:33.190 --> 02:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
there's probably some work that could be
 
02:50:36.870 --> 02:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
done on that for sure um it's it it was
 
02:50:39.670 --> 02:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
late I didn't uh have time to actually I
 
02:50:41.150 --> 02:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
was rewriting two other bills so I
 
02:50:44.269 --> 02:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to to to redo this one
 
02:50:44.279 --> 02:50:45.269 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to to to redo this one
um

02:50:45.269 --> 02:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:47.590 --> 02:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
and I certainly have no objection to
 
02:50:49.870 --> 02:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
amending it to to make it a better
 
02:50:53.229 --> 02:50:53.239 align:start position:0%

sorry a little out of breath I just ran
 
04:05:38.670 --> 04:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
up here from the the cafeteria I had to
 
04:05:40.670 --> 04:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
Grapple water real quick during the
 
04:05:44.510 --> 04:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
lunch period but um so House Bill 1561
 
04:05:47.389 --> 04:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
uh relative to um to school nutrition
 
04:05:48.670 --> 04:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
standards so the purpose of this
 
04:05:50.229 --> 04:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
legislation is to have New Hampshire
 
04:05:52.269 --> 04:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
adopt better school nutrition standards
 
04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
than what uh we are currently operating
 
04:05:56.590 --> 04:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
under the federal guidelines are Wolly
 
04:05:58.269 --> 04:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
uh inadequate to meet nutritional needs
 
04:05:59.750 --> 04:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's children New
 
04:06:01.630 --> 04:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should adopt uh some of these
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
science-based standards cited in House
 
04:06:06.870 --> 04:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 1561 will improve uh public and
 
04:06:08.670 --> 04:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
individual health improve educational
 
04:06:11.590 --> 04:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
outcomes and decrease long-term public
 
04:06:14.030 --> 04:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
costs to the state of New Hampshire
 
04:06:15.590 --> 04:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
investing in school meals and improving
 
04:06:17.030 --> 04:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
standards helps with a number of
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
economic and social issues according to
 
04:06:20.910 --> 04:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
a report conducted by the rockfeller
 
04:06:23.389 --> 04:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
foundation every dollar invested in
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
school meals generates about $2 in
 
04:06:27.630 --> 04:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
economic benefits the same report
 
04:06:29.389 --> 04:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
explains quote shifting nutritional
 
04:06:31.830 --> 04:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
quality even further away from foods
 
04:06:33.630 --> 04:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
like processed meat and those high in
 
04:06:36.510 --> 04:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
added sugars and toward meal patterns
 
04:06:39.189 --> 04:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
higher in uh whole grains legumes and
 
04:06:41.710 --> 04:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
vegetables would further help to prevent
 
04:06:43.950 --> 04:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
diet related diseases and also have
 
04:06:46.189 --> 04:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
environmental and climate benefits this
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
change nationally could yield more than
 
04:06:51.510 --> 04:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
1.5 billion additional net value each
 
04:06:53.469 --> 04:06:53.479 align:start position:0%
year the nonpartisan food research and
 
04:06:55.870 --> 04:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
action center you know Frack for short
 
04:06:58.030 --> 04:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
reports that quote based on National
 
04:07:00.110 --> 04:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
Data Economist estimate that the receipt
 
04:07:02.110 --> 04:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
of a free or reduced price School lch
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
reduces obesity rates by at least
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
177% um this could even increase more by
 
04:07:08.349 --> 04:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
improving our stand standards in the
 
04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire healthier
 
04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
students with better nutritional habits
 
04:07:13.870 --> 04:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
will utilize uh they'll utilize less
 
04:07:16.070 --> 04:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
resources in our healthare system uh
 
04:07:18.870 --> 04:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
today and later on in
 
04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
life uh reducing food insecurity at
 
04:07:23.389 --> 04:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
school also helps many Working Families
 
04:07:26.030 --> 04:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
manage their budg budgets and save for
 
04:07:27.469 --> 04:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
other pertinent Investments like
 
04:07:30.189 --> 04:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
retirement or college um better meals
 
04:07:32.229 --> 04:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
improves academic outcomes too according
 
04:07:34.910 --> 04:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
to the food research Action Center um
 
04:07:36.990 --> 04:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
quote children experiencing hunger are
 
04:07:39.149 --> 04:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
more likely to be be hyperactive absent
 
04:07:40.910 --> 04:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
and tardy in addition to having a b
 
04:07:43.149 --> 04:07:43.159 align:start position:0%
behavioral and attention problems more
 
04:07:46.349 --> 04:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
often than other children there appears
 
04:07:49.229 --> 04:07:49.239 align:start position:0%
uh and quote teens experiencing hunger
 
04:07:52.469 --> 04:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
are more likely to have uh to have been
 
04:07:54.109 --> 04:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
suspended from school and have
 
04:07:55.630 --> 04:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
difficulty getting along with other
 
04:07:57.349 --> 04:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
children end quote children with Hunger
 
04:07:59.590 --> 04:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
are also more likely to have repeated a
 
04:08:01.830 --> 04:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
grade receive special education serve
 
04:08:03.630 --> 04:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
services or receive mental health
 
04:08:05.910 --> 04:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
counseling than low-income children who
 
04:08:08.030 --> 04:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
do not experience hunger so these are
 
04:08:10.710 --> 04:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
people of the same socioeconomic level
 
04:08:12.990 --> 04:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
um both from uh poor backgrounds but
 
04:08:14.910 --> 04:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
children who have better meals and who
 
04:08:17.790 --> 04:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
are better wellfed tend to have higher
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
educational outcomes and less problems
 
04:08:22.229 --> 04:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
within the classroom um making students
 
04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
less hungry and fulfilling their
 
04:08:25.149 --> 04:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
nutritional needs will hopefully help
 
04:08:26.590 --> 04:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
those who fall through the cracks which
 
04:08:28.429 --> 04:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
we sadly see in our school system you
 
04:08:32.189 --> 04:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
know every year and every day um sadly
 
04:08:34.950 --> 04:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
our current meals and the poor nutrition
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh promoted by them is uh adding to the
 
04:08:39.830 --> 04:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
cycle of poverty that we try to end in
 
04:08:40.910 --> 04:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
this state whether it's through the New
 
04:08:43.030 --> 04:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire advantage or other things uh
 
04:08:44.510 --> 04:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has always done things
 
04:08:46.790 --> 04:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
better than the federal government so
 
04:08:48.670 --> 04:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
I'm unsure why we would use the federal
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
government's uh poor School nutritional
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
standards if we know that they're
 
04:08:54.269 --> 04:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
heavily influenced by a lot of national
 
04:08:56.070 --> 04:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
lobbying groups if we know that they're
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
not always science-based and that
 
04:08:59.590 --> 04:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're more Guided by um the
 
04:09:01.590 --> 04:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
interests of some businesses or of other
 
04:09:04.229 --> 04:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
special interest groups then why would
 
04:09:05.630 --> 04:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh why would states which can be the
 
04:09:07.189 --> 04:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
Laboratories of democracy not take it
 
04:09:08.590 --> 04:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
upon the M themselves and decide you
 
04:09:10.870 --> 04:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
know that we can create better standards
 
04:09:12.149 --> 04:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
that we're more close to our
 
04:09:13.790 --> 04:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
constituents and to our school districts
 
04:09:16.070 --> 04:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
and that we can better understand their
 
04:09:16.080 --> 04:09:18.189 align:start position:0%
and that we can better understand their
needs

04:09:18.189 --> 04:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
needs
 
04:09:20.710 --> 04:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
um not only that but uh we should we
 
04:09:23.710 --> 04:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
should take control of um of of the
 
04:09:25.309 --> 04:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
needs of our students as we've done you
 
04:09:28.349 --> 04:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
know in the last number of years and um
 
04:09:29.910 --> 04:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
create Innovation and coste effective
 
04:09:32.189 --> 04:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
solutions for granted Staters I think um
 
04:09:33.990 --> 04:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
I think this the investment that this
 
04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
legislation would make in helping the
 
04:09:37.109 --> 04:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Education Implement these
 
04:09:39.710 --> 04:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
new standards will have long-term and
 
04:09:41.309 --> 04:09:41.319 align:start position:0%
short-term benefits for students we're
 
04:09:42.550 --> 04:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
going to be able to keep more students
 
04:09:43.950 --> 04:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
in the classroom we're going to make
 
04:09:46.349 --> 04:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
sure that kids have lower obesity rates
 
04:09:47.550 --> 04:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to make sure that the Health
 
04:09:50.550 --> 04:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
Care system isn't as stressed later on
 
04:09:51.870 --> 04:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
and that we'll have more healthy
 
04:09:53.309 --> 04:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
citizens in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:09:54.670 --> 04:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
and more students we're going to achieve
 
04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
at a higher level um and with that I'll
 
04:09:58.910 --> 04:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh yield to any questions if the
 
04:10:00.670 --> 04:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
chairman permits thank you very much
 
04:10:02.830 --> 04:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
representative represent like
 
04:10:05.630 --> 04:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
us yes I agree with most of what you
 
04:10:07.950 --> 04:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
said but your bill doesn't seem to
 
04:10:10.550 --> 04:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
follow what you actually said you were
 
04:10:12.670 --> 04:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
talking about innovative solutions in
 
04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and following new
 
04:10:17.070 --> 04:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
technology and science and yet you're
 
04:10:21.469 --> 04:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
tying this to a certain extent to USDA
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
USDA um guidelines and stuff which is
 
04:10:27.469 --> 04:10:27.479 align:start position:0%
old science I noticed for instance whole
 
04:10:29.950 --> 04:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
grains doctors have pretty much figured
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
out that while yes whole grains have uh
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
more vitamins they also have more toxins
 
04:10:38.309 --> 04:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
lectins which caus cause inflammation
 
04:10:40.830 --> 04:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
and stuff and a lot of people are on a
 
04:10:43.309 --> 04:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
diet completely off of whole grains
 
04:10:45.070 --> 04:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
because of all the inflammation it
 
04:10:48.590 --> 04:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
caused and so it seems like you're tying
 
04:10:51.109 --> 04:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
this to old science instead of new
 
04:10:51.119 --> 04:10:52.910 align:start position:0%
this to old science instead of new
science

04:10:52.910 --> 04:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
science
 
04:10:55.710 --> 04:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
um and and you were talking about you
 
04:11:01.229 --> 04:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
know being flexible and and and um being
 
04:11:04.030 --> 04:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
able to change and yet you're kind of
 
04:11:07.429 --> 04:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
tying in with these specific stand
 
04:11:09.309 --> 04:11:09.319 align:start position:0%
standards and the other things you
 
04:11:11.309 --> 04:11:11.319 align:start position:0%
talked about vegetables and I would add
 
04:11:13.309 --> 04:11:13.319 align:start position:0%
fruits to that fruits and vegetables
 
04:11:14.830 --> 04:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
that's not even in here and that would
 
04:11:16.950 --> 04:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
be an awesome thing to get more of for
 
04:11:20.229 --> 04:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
students so I'm wondering why you did
 
04:11:22.349 --> 04:11:22.359 align:start position:0%
this approach when your goals seem to be
 
04:11:25.630 --> 04:11:25.640 align:start position:0%
different than what this says um well
 
04:11:26.429 --> 04:11:26.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:11:28.349 --> 04:11:28.359 align:start position:0%
representative leus I I appreciate it
 
04:11:29.670 --> 04:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
and um some of the nutritional things
 
04:11:31.269 --> 04:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
that you cited I'd love to see that and
 
04:11:32.870 --> 04:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
I think you know I assume some of the
 
04:11:35.109 --> 04:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
nutritionists who are here uh would be
 
04:11:37.710 --> 04:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
able to comment into a better better
 
04:11:39.790 --> 04:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
breadth of knowledge I should say depth
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
of knowledge than myself but um uh based
 
04:11:43.469 --> 04:11:43.479 align:start position:0%
on some of the things that I've
 
04:11:44.990 --> 04:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
understood speaking to the state's
 
04:11:46.349 --> 04:11:46.359 align:start position:0%
nutritionist and speaking to
 
04:11:47.710 --> 04:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
nutritionists from the American Heart
 
04:11:49.710 --> 04:11:49.720 align:start position:0%
Association is the vegetable allowance
 
04:11:51.109 --> 04:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
currently required by the federal
 
04:11:53.109 --> 04:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
government is pretty lock step in what's
 
04:11:56.189 --> 04:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
been accepted by um by nutritionists
 
04:11:57.630 --> 04:11:57.640 align:start position:0%
across the country nutritionists from
 
04:11:59.630 --> 04:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
the for example the University of uh
 
04:12:01.469 --> 04:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
Harvard Harvard University who um
 
04:12:02.910 --> 04:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to be sending in uh
 
04:12:04.269 --> 04:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
regarding some of the nutritional bills
 
04:12:05.510 --> 04:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
that I put in they're going to be
 
04:12:07.870 --> 04:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
sending in some testimony to uh to the
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
committee they just got back from their
 
04:12:11.070 --> 04:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
winter break though so they're a little
 
04:12:12.269 --> 04:12:12.279 align:start position:0%
bit delayed but hopefully in the next
 
04:12:13.790 --> 04:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks they will to kind of
 
04:12:15.710 --> 04:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
address some of those concerns that you
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
establish but um um I I think some of
 
04:12:20.349 --> 04:12:20.359 align:start position:0%
the things too is some of the science is
 
04:12:22.469 --> 04:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
older but it's been well established
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
right so I know you mentioned you know
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
for example the whole grains I'm pretty
 
04:12:27.389 --> 04:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
sure in the bill it was around 1990 some
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
of these studies were done or you know
 
04:12:30.469 --> 04:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
the 90s and um some of these things have
 
04:12:32.070 --> 04:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
been well established and they were even
 
04:12:34.070 --> 04:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
tried to be previously adopted by the
 
04:12:36.269 --> 04:12:36.279 align:start position:0%
federal government only for roll backs
 
04:12:39.550 --> 04:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
to happen right and so we we understand
 
04:12:41.189 --> 04:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
I think many nutritionists across I
 
04:12:42.389 --> 04:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say we but nutritionists
 
04:12:43.510 --> 04:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
across the country and across the state
 
04:12:45.550 --> 04:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire understand what the
 
04:12:47.070 --> 04:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
nutritional needs of students are the
 
04:12:48.510 --> 04:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
issue is we have a federal government
 
04:12:51.349 --> 04:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
right now that is um that's not really
 
04:12:53.550 --> 04:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
Meeting those expectations at least in
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
my opinion and I think the state of New
 
04:12:56.910 --> 04:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would do a better job you know
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
not only of looking over this stuff and
 
04:13:01.070 --> 04:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
trying to see you know which which kind
 
04:13:03.790 --> 04:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
of standards are the best ones to adopt
 
04:13:06.309 --> 04:13:06.319 align:start position:0%
but um but also understanding that we
 
04:13:07.910 --> 04:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
can we can adopt better standards than
 
04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
the federal government similar to how
 
04:13:10.670 --> 04:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
the state of uh Massachusetts done to
 
04:13:12.189 --> 04:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
our South and it hasn't really increased
 
04:13:14.870 --> 04:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
costs and it's created better um Better
 
04:13:16.830 --> 04:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
Health outcomes and better educational
 
04:13:18.389 --> 04:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
outcomes for a number of students who
 
04:13:19.590 --> 04:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
depend on these meals in their
 
04:13:21.630 --> 04:13:21.640 align:start position:0%
classrooms so um I would be more than
 
04:13:23.550 --> 04:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
happy though to you know and I think it
 
04:13:25.269 --> 04:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
would be more than uh if the committee
 
04:13:26.309 --> 04:13:26.319 align:start position:0%
would be more than willing to make
 
04:13:27.910 --> 04:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
amendments to the bill to nutritional
 
04:13:30.349 --> 04:13:30.359 align:start position:0%
standards that you might find to be more
 
04:13:33.309 --> 04:13:33.319 align:start position:0%
um easy easily adaptable to our uh
 
04:13:35.229 --> 04:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
Public School District and to work with
 
04:13:36.750 --> 04:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
nutritionists to really find out what
 
04:13:38.229 --> 04:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
those exact numbers are if you have a
 
04:13:40.309 --> 04:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
problem with the current numbers and I
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
think that's I think that's more than a
 
04:13:43.590 --> 04:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable approach to take thank you
 
04:13:45.710 --> 04:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
very much thank you are there further
 
04:13:47.790 --> 04:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
04:13:49.990 --> 04:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you Mr chairman
 
04:13:51.870 --> 04:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
representative Chase how you doing good
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
good to see you representative yeah
 
04:13:56.710 --> 04:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
similar um a couple questions I'm
 
04:14:00.550 --> 04:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
looking at page uh three this is page
 
04:14:02.990 --> 04:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
two but actually page three I guess uh
 
04:14:06.510 --> 04:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
on the waiver request uh the r request
 
04:14:09.950 --> 04:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
talking about no no no school shall be
 
04:14:11.990 --> 04:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
granted a waiver and then it talks about
 
04:14:15.389 --> 04:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
except for these exceptions um and then
 
04:14:17.750 --> 04:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
when I went back to the final part of
 
04:14:22.590 --> 04:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
your your uh bill under the FN section
 
04:14:24.630 --> 04:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
it states looking
 
04:14:27.710 --> 04:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
at almost a half a million dollars
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
annually to process waivers and
 
04:14:33.830 --> 04:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
categorize them um seems
 
04:14:37.070 --> 04:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
like it's talking none and then a few
 
04:14:38.469 --> 04:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
and then they're talking about six staff
 
04:14:40.670 --> 04:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
people to do that have you have you had
 
04:14:42.429 --> 04:14:42.439 align:start position:0%
that Dialogue on numbers with them yep
 
04:14:44.109 --> 04:14:44.119 align:start position:0%
yep I talked to the state's nutritionist
 
04:14:46.429 --> 04:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
about that um I would have to have them
 
04:14:49.149 --> 04:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
speak more to the fiscal note I um I
 
04:14:50.349 --> 04:14:50.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't imagine you know because I
 
04:14:52.550 --> 04:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
believe and you are correct um the six
 
04:14:54.269 --> 04:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
staff members they claimed that they
 
04:14:55.550 --> 04:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
would need six staff members to
 
04:14:57.109 --> 04:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
implement to be able to go through these
 
04:14:58.590 --> 04:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
waiver process and they said especially
 
04:15:00.469 --> 04:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
because there the number of waivers that
 
04:15:03.229 --> 04:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
would be needed if covid-19 was still a
 
04:15:05.630 --> 04:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
major factor to supply chains when this
 
04:15:07.750 --> 04:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
bill would go into effect which would be
 
04:15:09.469 --> 04:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
at the end of the budget cycle for the
 
04:15:12.550 --> 04:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
next bium right so June 1st or no sorry
 
04:15:15.510 --> 04:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
July 1st of uh 2023 which would also
 
04:15:17.229 --> 04:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
give School District some time to
 
04:15:19.229 --> 04:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
implement these kinds of standards um
 
04:15:21.309 --> 04:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
and to see them coming down the pipeline
 
04:15:23.109 --> 04:15:23.119 align:start position:0%
um they'd have to speak more as to why
 
04:15:24.750 --> 04:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
they feel they need six they explain
 
04:15:26.269 --> 04:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
that that's just what they would need
 
04:15:28.429 --> 04:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
based on anticipated volume when we
 
04:15:30.429 --> 04:15:30.439 align:start position:0%
talked they didn't really explain why
 
04:15:31.790 --> 04:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
they thought the volume would be enough
 
04:15:35.189 --> 04:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
for six people to uh to go and you know
 
04:15:37.550 --> 04:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
do these standards uh sorry to to make
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
these um these uh to process these
 
04:15:42.349 --> 04:15:42.359 align:start position:0%
waiver applications so that's something
 
04:15:44.389 --> 04:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
that um it's an ongoing dialogue but the
 
04:15:46.229 --> 04:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
dialogue did happen that's the number
 
04:15:48.149 --> 04:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
that they're pretty set on and um I
 
04:15:49.750 --> 04:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
don't anticipate them changing that
 
04:15:51.790 --> 04:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
number anytime soon follow up Mr
 
04:15:54.510 --> 04:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you sir um Al
 
04:15:56.750 --> 04:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative in in uh I'm the same
 
04:15:59.750 --> 04:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
page I'm looking at line 24 is talking
 
04:16:02.910 --> 04:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
about the the curricular impact uh we
 
04:16:04.910 --> 04:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
you were creating a curriculum for a K
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
to 12 or they would be the St I guess
 
04:16:10.030 --> 04:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
for K 12 instruction now it's my
 
04:16:10.750 --> 04:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that a lot of the
 
04:16:12.510 --> 04:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
nutritional information information
 
04:16:14.070 --> 04:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
because it's a it's a curriculum that
 
04:16:15.830 --> 04:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
would be uh taught in the classroom was
 
04:16:15.840 --> 04:16:16.630 align:start position:0%
would be uh taught in the classroom was
already

04:16:16.630 --> 04:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
ongoing so I don't know that if that's
 
04:16:20.950 --> 04:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
part of their Staffing piece for
 
04:16:20.960 --> 04:16:22.469 align:start position:0%
part of their Staffing piece for
curriculum

04:16:22.469 --> 04:16:22.479 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
04:16:24.870 --> 04:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
or it might be but when we had that
 
04:16:26.269 --> 04:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
conversation that wasn't something that
 
04:16:27.990 --> 04:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
we touched upon but I can certainly um I
 
04:16:29.550 --> 04:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
can reach back out to the nutritionist
 
04:16:31.469 --> 04:16:31.479 align:start position:0%
and I can get back to you on that well
 
04:16:34.149 --> 04:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
just the just the CL Clarity it's all I
 
04:16:37.149 --> 04:16:37.159 align:start position:0%
need on on 3A are you anticipating say
 
04:16:40.750 --> 04:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
that the pro this program is going to uh
 
04:16:44.030 --> 04:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
have hat in hand with the the food piece
 
04:16:45.790 --> 04:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to create a new curriculum
 
04:16:48.670 --> 04:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
for all schools and that's I'm looking
 
04:16:48.680 --> 04:16:49.950 align:start position:0%
for all schools and that's I'm looking
at

04:16:49.950 --> 04:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:16:54.990 --> 04:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
three uh a line 24 through 26 here let
 
04:17:05.790 --> 04:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.800 --> 04:17:14.149 align:start position:0%
 
copy

04:17:14.149 --> 04:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:15.750 --> 04:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
what page is that again representative
 
04:17:17.429 --> 04:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
my apologies it says page two it's
 
04:17:19.910 --> 04:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
actually it's page two on the do the
 
04:17:24.590 --> 04:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
page two it's line 24 through 26 line 24
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
through 26 yeah I think that looks to be
 
04:17:30.630 --> 04:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
current current law okay so so they're
 
04:17:32.469 --> 04:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
not going to be creating that so no
 
04:17:33.429 --> 04:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
that's already that's already
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
established yeah okay it's already in
 
04:17:38.149 --> 04:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
place yep thank you thank you Mr
 
04:17:39.790 --> 04:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
chairman my apologies also
 
04:17:41.630 --> 04:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
representative for the confusion
 
04:17:44.630 --> 04:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative Mullen thank you Mr chair
 
04:17:46.469 --> 04:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
04:17:51.550 --> 04:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
my question um so there's a considerable
 
04:17:54.030 --> 04:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
price tag associated with those six
 
04:17:58.149 --> 04:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
staff members and of note for me is the
 
04:18:00.189 --> 04:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
fact that those staff members would be
 
04:18:03.309 --> 04:18:03.319 align:start position:0%
looking to support 520 public and
 
04:18:07.830 --> 04:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools and also 137
 
04:18:14.269 --> 04:18:14.279 align:start position:0%
nonpublic schools so my uh question
 
04:18:18.109 --> 04:18:18.119 align:start position:0%
is did you consider a way that
 
04:18:21.109 --> 04:18:21.119 align:start position:0%
non-public schools might be
 
04:18:25.030 --> 04:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
held accountable for participating in
 
04:18:27.070 --> 04:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
the costs of those staff members I mean
 
04:18:30.070 --> 04:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
I I just I I don't think I'm incorrect
 
04:18:32.550 --> 04:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Education has no
 
04:18:35.710 --> 04:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the non-public schools
 
04:18:39.630 --> 04:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure I'm looking at the
 
04:18:43.229 --> 04:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
statement from uh the fiscal note the
 
04:18:46.229 --> 04:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
backside of the fiscal note yeah says
 
04:18:49.510 --> 04:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
under this proposed legislation onps
 
04:18:52.510 --> 04:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
would be required to now support up to
 
04:18:55.429 --> 04:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
520 public schools to include chartered
 
04:18:59.670 --> 04:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
Public Schools as well as 137 nonpublic
 
04:19:03.670 --> 04:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
schools so um if you uh representative
 
04:19:06.429 --> 04:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
did not consider that factor I would
 
04:19:08.229 --> 04:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
like to hear from the Department of Ed
 
04:19:08.239 --> 04:19:09.389 align:start position:0%
like to hear from the Department of Ed
on

04:19:09.389 --> 04:19:09.399 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:19:12.510 --> 04:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
where they see themselves in this
 
04:19:14.750 --> 04:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
process with non-public
 
04:19:16.710 --> 04:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
schools yeah and I'm I'm unsure if
 
04:19:18.109 --> 04:19:18.119 align:start position:0%
someone from the Department of Education
 
04:19:19.910 --> 04:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
is here from the nutrition program but I
 
04:19:21.469 --> 04:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
can certainly take down that question
 
04:19:23.349 --> 04:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
and uh follow up with you repres it's
 
04:19:27.389 --> 04:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
okay I'm looking at them they're they're
 
04:19:29.870 --> 04:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
here are there further
 
04:19:32.389 --> 04:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
questions we will get to where you were
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
represent Mullen when
 
04:19:35.640 --> 04:19:38.229 align:start position:0%
represent Mullen when
we're

04:19:38.229 --> 04:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:19:38.239 --> 04:19:39.870 align:start position:0%
we're
represent

04:19:39.870 --> 04:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:19:43.870 --> 04:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
leas yes and in a followup to um
 
04:19:47.070 --> 04:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock on the section
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
on waivers I'm wondering why you just
 
04:19:52.910 --> 04:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
had to waiver to
 
04:19:56.710 --> 04:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
covid-19 um there can be other supply
 
04:20:01.070 --> 04:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
chain issues floods hurricanes whatever
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh do schools not get a waiver for those
 
04:20:07.070 --> 04:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues only for covid
 
04:20:08.630 --> 04:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
um in this legislation way I've written
 
04:20:10.429 --> 04:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
it it's uh the same kind of waiver
 
04:20:12.469 --> 04:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
process that would be done that I think
 
04:20:15.030 --> 04:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
we have established for some of the um
 
04:20:17.950 --> 04:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
some the novelty of the covid-19 um
 
04:20:19.870 --> 04:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
issue that we have going on right now
 
04:20:21.309 --> 04:20:21.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if there's any other
 
04:20:23.030 --> 04:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
waivers from the Department of Education
 
04:20:25.389 --> 04:20:25.399 align:start position:0%
where they wave national food standards
 
04:20:26.870 --> 04:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
or you know currently the state doesn't
 
04:20:29.389 --> 04:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
have any food standards for uh for um
 
04:20:31.469 --> 04:20:31.479 align:start position:0%
for School meals but I don't think we
 
04:20:33.950 --> 04:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
have any process for waving the national
 
04:20:35.349 --> 04:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
standards I'm not sure if the national
 
04:20:36.630 --> 04:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
government does but I think that that's
 
04:20:38.429 --> 04:20:38.439 align:start position:0%
a good question for the uh for the
 
04:20:39.670 --> 04:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
nutritionist from the Department of
 
04:20:41.070 --> 04:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
Education or the department of
 
04:20:42.510 --> 04:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
education's Representative but I'll
 
04:20:44.149 --> 04:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
certainly um if it isn't addressed I'll
 
04:20:45.510 --> 04:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
write that question down I'll follow up
 
04:20:51.990 --> 04:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:54.710 --> 04:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
questions not yes repesent
 
04:20:57.229 --> 04:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:21:00.590 --> 04:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative um in terms of meeting
 
04:21:03.109 --> 04:21:03.119 align:start position:0%
these Target two target three Target
 
04:21:03.119 --> 04:21:04.349 align:start position:0%
these Target two target three Target
four

04:21:04.349 --> 04:21:04.359 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:21:08.670 --> 04:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
levels um that are acquired um in uh
 
04:21:12.189 --> 04:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
future years um is there anything in law
 
04:21:15.910 --> 04:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
that prevents um a district from um
 
04:21:19.830 --> 04:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
meeting these uh targets uh now or uh in
 
04:21:24.830 --> 04:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
bill I don't think there's anything in
 
04:21:29.550 --> 04:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
law that inhibits a school district but
 
04:21:30.990 --> 04:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if we've done anything to
 
04:21:34.189 --> 04:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
enable a school district from doing so
 
04:21:36.189 --> 04:21:36.199 align:start position:0%
um this would certainly it would require
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
it but I'm not sure if anything um and
 
04:21:40.429 --> 04:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
you can correct me Mr Vice chairman or
 
04:21:41.710 --> 04:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
someone from the Department of Education
 
04:21:44.590 --> 04:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm mistaken but um to my
 
04:21:46.149 --> 04:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
understanding the school districts
 
04:21:48.590 --> 04:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
follow the federal guidelines and uh the
 
04:21:49.950 --> 04:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
ru making that comes from the federal
 
04:21:51.670 --> 04:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
government on School
 
04:21:53.670 --> 04:21:53.680 align:start position:0%

04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
question my apologies I should have
 
04:21:58.790 --> 04:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
started with that are there further

handed out written testimony so I'll
 
04:22:51.630 --> 04:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
I'll try not to read um verbatim from
 
04:22:54.510 --> 04:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
from my uh my my written words um but I
 
04:22:57.510 --> 04:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
just want to start by saying um that the
 
04:22:59.229 --> 04:22:59.239 align:start position:0%
American Heart Association greatly
 
04:23:02.550 --> 04:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
supports the passage of this bill um uh
 
04:23:05.590 --> 04:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
our organization um has been working on
 
04:23:09.030 --> 04:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
um child nutrition um policy efforts for
 
04:23:11.229 --> 04:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
a number of years including working
 
04:23:14.309 --> 04:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
closely at the federal level um on the
 
04:23:18.349 --> 04:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
uh healthy hunger free kids act um and
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
this this really starts with that act um
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
signed into law back in 2010 um and then
 
04:23:28.269 --> 04:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
going into effect for um The Years 2012
 
04:23:31.189 --> 04:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
and 2016 on some of the the
 
04:23:33.750 --> 04:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
science-based on nutrition standards for
 
04:23:36.790 --> 04:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
kids um and when this did go go into
 
04:23:39.630 --> 04:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
effect um for for state level school
 
04:23:42.269 --> 04:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
districts um it it was a learning curve
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
it was a a great deal of effort put into
 
04:23:46.510 --> 04:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
it and I applaud School F Food Service
 
04:23:48.990 --> 04:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
directors for doing as much as they have
 
04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
um in in imp um putting into place these
 
04:23:55.229 --> 04:23:55.239 align:start position:0%
uh these guidelines and 99% of schools
 
04:23:57.830 --> 04:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
pre pandemic actually were meeting the
 
04:24:00.070 --> 04:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
standards of the federal government um
 
04:24:02.950 --> 04:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
but what happened um in the last several
 
04:24:05.349 --> 04:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
years is there have been some efforts um
 
04:24:08.030 --> 04:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
to put pressure on the USDA to either
 
04:24:10.309 --> 04:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
roll back some of their um their
 
04:24:13.109 --> 04:24:13.119 align:start position:0%
standards um or to delay the
 
04:24:14.870 --> 04:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
implementation and I think what we're
 
04:24:16.550 --> 04:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
seeing now or I know what we're seeing
 
04:24:18.550 --> 04:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
now is just the fact that the USDA has
 
04:24:20.910 --> 04:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
not enforced some of the the food
 
04:24:23.590 --> 04:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
standards that we are addressing um uh
 
04:24:25.630 --> 04:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
today in the conversation around this
 
04:24:28.830 --> 04:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
bill um mainly de deal dealing with
 
04:24:31.550 --> 04:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
sodium levels um the whole grain levels
 
04:24:33.550 --> 04:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
I know there's a question on and also
 
04:24:36.590 --> 04:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
added sugars um so first of all I just
 
04:24:39.710 --> 04:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
um want to to say on the sodium level
 
04:24:42.070 --> 04:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
what we um what we know is that um
 
04:24:44.389 --> 04:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
children are are eating consuming far
 
04:24:47.070 --> 04:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
too much sodium as all of us are in the
 
04:24:48.469 --> 04:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
foods that we eat a lot of that is
 
04:24:50.469 --> 04:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
because of processed foods but they're
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
still consuming too much sodium even in
 
04:24:55.429 --> 04:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
the school um School Meal program
 
04:24:57.429 --> 04:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
because those targets that were were
 
04:25:00.269 --> 04:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
questioned and discussed a moment ago um
 
04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
that were set to put to be put into
 
04:25:04.990 --> 04:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
place in a staggered um method which is
 
04:25:07.309 --> 04:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
being done with this build as well um
 
04:25:09.429 --> 04:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
we're we're pulled back on at the
 
04:25:13.030 --> 04:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
federal level um so we are looking at
 
04:25:15.469 --> 04:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
this again as um representative Des said
 
04:25:18.109 --> 04:25:18.119 align:start position:0%
of having a New Hampshire standard that
 
04:25:21.710 --> 04:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
starts with the federal um food program
 
04:25:24.070 --> 04:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
standards but expands upon them for
 
04:25:26.070 --> 04:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
these science-based changes that have
 
04:25:28.710 --> 04:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
not been made at the federal level um
 
04:25:31.109 --> 04:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
and uh and obviously I'm not going to
 
04:25:32.550 --> 04:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
get into all the health reasons that's
 
04:25:34.630 --> 04:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
in my testimony because you are are the
 
04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
the education committee um um but it is
 
04:25:38.469 --> 04:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
for health reasons we we just need to
 
04:25:40.910 --> 04:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
really help children grow to be as
 
04:25:42.590 --> 04:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
healthy as they possibly can with the
 
04:25:44.550 --> 04:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
foods that we're serving um particularly
 
04:25:50.790 --> 04:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
in school um uh so we we are looking at
 
04:25:53.710 --> 04:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
meeting the targets that if the federal
 
04:25:55.870 --> 04:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
government does suddenly say we are now
 
04:25:57.830 --> 04:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
going to enforce the targets with all
 
04:26:00.349 --> 04:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
the school lunch programs that we we put
 
04:26:02.990 --> 04:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
into play a timeline um and then you'll
 
04:26:05.790 --> 04:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
notice the words or um by the time that
 
04:26:09.030 --> 04:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
the um USDA makes these changes so we
 
04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
are not in any way saying that schools
 
04:26:13.189 --> 04:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
can't meet these standards now it's just
 
04:26:14.590 --> 04:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
they they they meet the standards when
 
04:26:17.149 --> 04:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
the USDA says okay now this is this is
 
04:26:19.950 --> 04:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
when it goes into play and and um
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
corporations who are making the foods
 
04:26:25.229 --> 04:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
for schools um to serve to students are
 
04:26:28.670 --> 04:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
then also forced to to make those um
 
04:26:31.070 --> 04:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
those uh those changes with their
 
04:26:34.550 --> 04:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
formulations um I am not aware um too
 
04:26:36.910 --> 04:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
much on the the science around toxicity
 
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
of whole grains with but it may very
 
04:26:41.269 --> 04:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
well be with with some individuals and I
 
04:26:42.710 --> 04:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
believe school districts would make
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
allowances for for children's particular
 
04:26:49.510 --> 04:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
individual um food um uh sensitivities
 
04:26:51.590 --> 04:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
as well um but again obviously
 
04:26:53.790 --> 04:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
nutritionist will say um more about that
 
04:26:56.309 --> 04:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
than than I can I'm not a nutritionist
 
04:26:58.469 --> 04:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
um so again sodium is of particular
 
04:27:00.229 --> 04:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
concern to us the whole grains is a
 
04:27:02.590 --> 04:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
concern to us the added sugars I don't
 
04:27:04.070 --> 04:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
believe there were really strong
 
04:27:05.990 --> 04:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
standards put into place around added
 
04:27:08.790 --> 04:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
sugars and again children and all of us
 
04:27:11.149 --> 04:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
are taking in far too many added sugars
 
04:27:13.349 --> 04:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
and um in the the beverages that we're
 
04:27:15.109 --> 04:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
consuming fortunately at the school
 
04:27:18.309 --> 04:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
level we have taken sugary um drinks out
 
04:27:20.870 --> 04:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
of um the the school environment for for
 
04:27:22.990 --> 04:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
the most part which is very good though
 
04:27:25.630 --> 04:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
it's still still kind of there um but
 
04:27:28.229 --> 04:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
this is really in the Foods um that um
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
that would be served to to Children
 
04:27:32.950 --> 04:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
looking at um science-based standards
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
and I believe the um the dietary
 
04:27:37.109 --> 04:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
standards for Americans call for no more
 
04:27:39.510 --> 04:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
than 10% of calories to be from added
 
04:27:41.429 --> 04:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
added sugars in in the foods that that
 
04:27:43.269 --> 04:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
children eat and we'd like schools to be
 
04:27:46.990 --> 04:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
following that as well um I think that
 
04:27:49.070 --> 04:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much covers what I really wanted
 
04:27:53.269 --> 04:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
to um to focus on um and if there is any
 
04:27:55.830 --> 04:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
information that we can provide after
 
04:27:58.429 --> 04:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
this this hearing um or even today if
 
04:28:00.590 --> 04:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's something I just I know of I can
 
04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
answer for you I will um I'm happy to
 
04:28:04.149 --> 04:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
work with the committee on gain more
 
04:28:06.950 --> 04:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
information to you so so thank you very
 
04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
much for taking my testimony I hope that
 
04:28:11.429 --> 04:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
you will consider this bill um and and
 
04:28:12.910 --> 04:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
ways that we can can pass it to make
 
04:28:15.149 --> 04:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
sure we're serving children as close to
 
04:28:18.349 --> 04:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
science um recommended um nutrients as
 
04:28:19.990 --> 04:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
we can in schools thank you very much
 
04:28:23.030 --> 04:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
for your presentation uh are there any
 
04:28:26.349 --> 04:28:26.359 align:start position:0%
questions at this time not seeing thank
 
04:28:30.030 --> 04:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
you we don't have any are there any
 
04:28:35.550 --> 04:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
other folks here that have pink cards

would so we have several people from the
 
04:28:47.950 --> 04:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
Department back there come on up thank
 
04:28:52.950 --> 04:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:55.349 --> 04:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
welcome welcome

support um Kelly Rambo administrator for
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
nutrition programs and
 
04:29:04.720 --> 04:29:07.389 align:start position:0%
nutrition programs and
services

04:29:07.389 --> 04:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:29:09.229 --> 04:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
representa Mullen you want to lead I'm
 
04:29:12.750 --> 04:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
on I'm on okay so um thank you very much
 
04:29:15.750 --> 04:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
for coming and answering questions this
 
04:29:19.790 --> 04:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon so there are references in and
 
04:29:21.830 --> 04:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
around the bill to the Department of
 
04:29:24.670 --> 04:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
Education both from you know the state
 
04:29:27.510 --> 04:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
board and the role of doe in developing
 
04:29:32.030 --> 04:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum to uh the six new potential
 
04:29:34.269 --> 04:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
positions that would have to be created
 
04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
to manage the the new program so my
 
04:29:42.349 --> 04:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
questions are about uh whether or not
 
04:29:45.389 --> 04:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
you can let us know if you currently are
 
04:29:49.389 --> 04:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
doing anything with schools that are
 
04:29:54.070 --> 04:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
non-public and whether or not um you do
 
04:29:56.309 --> 04:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
things with schools that don't
 
04:30:00.309 --> 04:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
participate in the national school lunch
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
program thank you and first we do want
 
04:30:04.590 --> 04:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
to say that we appreciated um
 
04:30:07.109 --> 04:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
representative des's request for and his
 
04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
attention to um the technical assistance
 
04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
previously provided to the by the
 
04:30:16.109 --> 04:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
department um so the the reason why it
 
04:30:18.070 --> 04:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
would require significant additional
 
04:30:19.510 --> 04:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
staff capacity and the department
 
04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
actually submitted to LBA uh an estimate
 
04:30:24.790 --> 04:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
of three to six additional staff is
 
04:30:26.469 --> 04:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
because currently our office of
 
04:30:28.109 --> 04:30:28.119 align:start position:0%
nutrition programs and services
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
implements federal regulations that
 
04:30:33.429 --> 04:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
follow federal funds this would add
 
04:30:36.269 --> 04:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
state regulations to nonparticipants ANS
 
04:30:38.070 --> 04:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
in the national school lunch program
 
04:30:39.870 --> 04:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
that are more stringent than the
 
04:30:41.630 --> 04:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
existing Federal requirements so this
 
04:30:44.229 --> 04:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't establish um in a sense it
 
04:30:46.870 --> 04:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
establishes New Hampshire's uh unique
 
04:30:49.550 --> 04:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
requirements but it actually a as
 
04:30:53.189 --> 04:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
previously testified to um identifies
 
04:30:55.429 --> 04:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
Target levels in the areas of sodium
 
04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
grains and sugars um that were set by
 
04:31:00.830 --> 04:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
the USDA but were not executed
 
04:31:04.189 --> 04:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
implemented required by the USDA um for
 
04:31:06.070 --> 04:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
their stated reasons of concern around
 
04:31:08.309 --> 04:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
supply chain and decreasing
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
participation um in uh School provided
 
04:31:14.389 --> 04:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
lunches because of um student concern
 
04:31:17.510 --> 04:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
around taste uh so so hopefully that
 
04:31:20.469 --> 04:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
provides some clarity in addition to um
 
04:31:22.149 --> 04:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
now implementing both a federal
 
04:31:24.910 --> 04:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory schema and a new State uh set
 
04:31:27.229 --> 04:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
of requirements we would need to as
 
04:31:30.109 --> 04:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
stated evaluate provide and then report
 
04:31:33.070 --> 04:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
upon uh waivers to these state
 
04:31:35.870 --> 04:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
requirements we do currently implement
 
04:31:39.630 --> 04:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
covid-19 related USDA waivers and report
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
that to USDA but those are all under the
 
04:31:46.389 --> 04:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
federal regulatory schema um and then
 
04:31:48.149 --> 04:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
just one additional Point uh that we'd
 
04:31:49.990 --> 04:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
bring up is around the implementation
 
04:31:51.990 --> 04:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
timeline and ensuring that we draw
 
04:31:54.710 --> 04:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
attention to the 60 days after passage
 
04:31:56.630 --> 04:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
implementation timeline which we would
 
04:32:00.149 --> 04:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
find um not feasible to implement uh and
 
04:32:01.790 --> 04:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
then specifically to your question
 
04:32:03.830 --> 04:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
around um non-public schools currently
 
04:32:05.670 --> 04:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
non-public schools some nonu Public
 
04:32:07.670 --> 04:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
Schools participate through their SA
 
04:32:10.950 --> 04:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
saus or leas but there are no State
 
04:32:14.229 --> 04:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
nutrition requirements um applied to
 
04:32:16.750 --> 04:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
nonparticipants um participants or
 
04:32:16.760 --> 04:32:19.269 align:start position:0%
nonparticipants um participants or
non-public

04:32:19.269 --> 04:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
non-public
 
04:32:22.389 --> 04:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
schools thank you you have a followup go
 
04:32:26.870 --> 04:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
ahead yes thank you Mr chair so um in
 
04:32:26.880 --> 04:32:29.429 align:start position:0%
ahead yes thank you Mr chair so um in
your

04:32:29.429 --> 04:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:32.590 --> 04:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
experience do you have a sense of how
 
04:32:36.030 --> 04:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
the nonpublic world would feel
 
04:32:40.229 --> 04:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
feel about these regulations being
 
04:32:42.910 --> 04:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
placed upon
 
04:32:45.229 --> 04:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
them we have not conferred with the
 
04:32:47.309 --> 04:32:47.319 align:start position:0%
nonpublic school Community or individual
 
04:32:49.990 --> 04:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
non-public school leaders or teachers um
 
04:32:53.429 --> 04:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
about the uh what it would take for them
 
04:32:55.870 --> 04:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
to uniquely Implement these requirements
 
04:32:58.510 --> 04:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
but they are um observably significant
 
04:32:58.520 --> 04:33:01.269 align:start position:0%
but they are um observably significant
new

04:33:01.269 --> 04:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.310 --> 04:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
requirements thank you I I have a
 
04:33:07.590 --> 04:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
question for you uh then represent boom
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
um this bill references that the
 
04:33:12.949 --> 04:33:12.959 align:start position:0%
department shall be responsible for
 
04:33:16.189 --> 04:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
preparing and uh Distributing a
 
04:33:19.310 --> 04:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
curriculum associated with this bill it
 
04:33:21.590 --> 04:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
also states that the State Board shall
 
04:33:24.590 --> 04:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
develop rules according to
 
04:33:26.349 --> 04:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
541a uh
 
04:33:29.869 --> 04:33:29.879 align:start position:0%
regarding uh the Rel relative policies
 
04:33:34.029 --> 04:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
associated with this bill so my question
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
is um
 
04:33:38.429 --> 04:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
in looking at the development of
 
04:33:42.429 --> 04:33:42.439 align:start position:0%
curriculum when the department has been
 
04:33:45.269 --> 04:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
engaged seeing that curriculum is primar
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
primarily a responsibility of the local
 
04:33:47.520 --> 04:33:48.629 align:start position:0%
primarily a responsibility of the local
school

04:33:48.629 --> 04:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:33:51.789 --> 04:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
district how long and does your process
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
take in order to develop a curriculum
 
04:33:57.070 --> 04:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about standards I'm
 
04:33:58.510 --> 04:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
talking about the
 
04:34:01.109 --> 04:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
curriculum how long will it take you to
 
04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
develop a curriculum if you in fact work
 
04:34:07.390 --> 04:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
with School District Personnel put
 
04:34:09.150 --> 04:34:09.160 align:start position:0%
together a task force come up with
 
04:34:10.910 --> 04:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations and then get approval
 
04:34:13.750 --> 04:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
for that curriculum uh from the state
 
04:34:18.310 --> 04:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
board um and rules the same thing is it
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
is it realistic to believe that this is
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
all going to be ready to go within a
 
04:34:24.990 --> 04:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
one-year period of
 
04:34:28.869 --> 04:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
time so currently we do not um develop
 
04:34:31.551 --> 04:34:31.561 align:start position:0%
and disseminate curriculum um in any
 
04:34:34.830 --> 04:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
area it is a local uh decision what
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum to adopt the State Board of
 
04:34:38.949 --> 04:34:38.959 align:start position:0%
Education approves state standards as
 
04:34:41.390 --> 04:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
you stated so um that would be a
 
04:34:44.269 --> 04:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
significant um shift in the roles
 
04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
between state and local
 
04:34:48.750 --> 04:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
governments so and followup the State
 
04:34:52.029 --> 04:34:52.039 align:start position:0%
Board in this bill is responsible for
 
04:34:54.429 --> 04:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
developing a curriculum I.E the
 
04:34:57.029 --> 04:34:57.039 align:start position:0%
department and that is a shift from
 
04:34:58.629 --> 04:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
where we've been in terms of other
 
04:35:00.869 --> 04:35:00.879 align:start position:0%
topics like history government
 
04:35:03.990 --> 04:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
mathematics Etc correct we do not create
 
04:35:06.789 --> 04:35:06.799 align:start position:0%
or um endorse or disseminate curriculum
 
04:35:06.799 --> 04:35:08.269 align:start position:0%
or um endorse or disseminate curriculum
thank

04:35:08.269 --> 04:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:35:11.910 --> 04:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
you uh represent B you were next thank
 
04:35:14.070 --> 04:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank take a question to
 
04:35:15.750 --> 04:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative Mull's
 
04:35:17.349 --> 04:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
question which I didn't hear an answer
 
04:35:20.670 --> 04:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
to Is what about public schools that do
 
04:35:23.949 --> 04:35:23.959 align:start position:0%
not participate in the federal food
 
04:35:26.310 --> 04:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
program which there off
 
04:35:30.230 --> 04:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
some yep so there um and that was
 
04:35:31.789 --> 04:35:31.799 align:start position:0%
constituted in the
 
04:35:34.310 --> 04:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
466 uh non-public schools currently
 
04:35:37.429 --> 04:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
participating in an SL SLP in about 520
 
04:35:39.551 --> 04:35:39.561 align:start position:0%
total schools um so those schools that
 
04:35:42.670 --> 04:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
are not current total Public Schools
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
those schools not currently
 
04:35:46.949 --> 04:35:46.959 align:start position:0%
participating um would be required to
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
comply with new state requirements um
 
04:35:53.670 --> 04:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of their participation in the
 
04:35:56.551 --> 04:35:56.561 align:start position:0%
nslp program um in regardless of their
 
04:35:58.349 --> 04:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
receipt of federal
 
04:36:03.310 --> 04:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
funds follow up yes thank you um one of
 
04:36:05.269 --> 04:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
the reasons schools aren't participa
 
04:36:08.349 --> 04:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
ating because nobody was eating the food
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
that was being required so how is this
 
04:36:17.590 --> 04:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:20.949 --> 04:36:20.959 align:start position:0%
food I I can't really speak to um how it
 
04:36:25.470 --> 04:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:27.470 --> 04:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
taste do you have another question
 
04:36:30.150 --> 04:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
represent B no you're good
 
04:36:32.750 --> 04:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli uh thank you Mr
 
04:36:34.590 --> 04:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you again for being
 
04:36:38.310 --> 04:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
here um going back to the section on
 
04:36:41.429 --> 04:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
rules um on bottom of page two and top
 
04:36:44.429 --> 04:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
of Page Three um it requires the
 
04:36:46.910 --> 04:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
department to come up with rules um
 
04:36:51.070 --> 04:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
including a model physical activity
 
04:36:54.189 --> 04:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
policy that uh I would like to ask about
 
04:36:58.230 --> 04:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
as well as um a rule regarding technical
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:04.000 --> 04:37:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
requirements

04:37:05.830 --> 04:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:37:07.629 --> 04:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
um do you have any thoughts on the
 
04:37:10.551 --> 04:37:10.561 align:start position:0%
development of uh either of those rules
 
04:37:13.310 --> 04:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
because developing a rule related to
 
04:37:17.629 --> 04:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:20.429 --> 04:37:20.439 align:start position:0%
unusual I I'm not entirely sure what's
 
04:37:23.629 --> 04:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
encapsulated in the intent of uh what
 
04:37:24.750 --> 04:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
What's meant to be covered by State
 
04:37:26.390 --> 04:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
Board of Education rulemakings and
 
04:37:28.590 --> 04:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps um representative desay what
 
04:37:31.230 --> 04:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
could better clarify the intent behind
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh the topics to be
 
04:37:34.000 --> 04:37:35.709 align:start position:0%
uh the topics to be
covered

04:37:35.709 --> 04:37:35.719 align:start position:0%
covered
 
04:37:37.551 --> 04:37:37.561 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify perhaps what
 
04:37:40.390 --> 04:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli is going after
 
04:37:43.510 --> 04:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
um we get regulation from F federal
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
government when we establish statute
 
04:37:49.269 --> 04:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
rule is made to support that statute to
 
04:37:51.910 --> 04:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
align and parallel with the
 
04:37:54.150 --> 04:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
statute I think he's trying to say and I
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
don't want to put words in his mouth but
 
04:38:00.429 --> 04:38:00.439 align:start position:0%
policy we don't develop rules for
 
04:38:04.590 --> 04:38:04.600 align:start position:0%
policy I think it's that clear um is
 
04:38:07.789 --> 04:38:07.799 align:start position:0%
that where you were thank
 
04:38:11.109 --> 04:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
you you put the words in my mouth
 
04:38:15.070 --> 04:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
nicely okay further questions yes
 
04:38:15.080 --> 04:38:16.470 align:start position:0%
nicely okay further questions yes
represent

04:38:16.470 --> 04:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:38:18.990 --> 04:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
whitcock thank you Mr chairman good
 
04:38:21.310 --> 04:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon again um couple questions
 
04:38:24.629 --> 04:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
going back to a follow up on um
 
04:38:28.551 --> 04:38:28.561 align:start position:0%
represent mullen's uh initial thinking
 
04:38:29.750 --> 04:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh when you're when they're talking
 
04:38:33.150 --> 04:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
about the other uh schools it's about 60
 
04:38:36.551 --> 04:38:36.561 align:start position:0%
I guess from the 460 520 that are not
 
04:38:39.470 --> 04:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
participating now um does the department
 
04:38:40.670 --> 04:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
a couple questions do the department
 
04:38:42.349 --> 04:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
have any knowledge or why they aren't
 
04:38:44.830 --> 04:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
participating besides the the one that
 
04:38:48.150 --> 04:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
was presented um and secondly how would
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
you how would you monitor you're talking
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
about expand monitoring of the 137
 
04:38:55.269 --> 04:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
nonpublic schools how do you do
 
04:38:58.910 --> 04:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
that so it would be a significant um
 
04:39:00.869 --> 04:39:00.879 align:start position:0%
expansion of our current monitoring
 
04:39:02.709 --> 04:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
responsibilities which again apply only
 
04:39:06.590 --> 04:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
to participants and um are only for the
 
04:39:08.789 --> 04:39:08.799 align:start position:0%
existing Federal requirements so we we
 
04:39:11.310 --> 04:39:11.320 align:start position:0%
both add a significant number of
 
04:39:13.629 --> 04:39:13.639 align:start position:0%
participants about a 40% increase in the
 
04:39:16.869 --> 04:39:16.879 align:start position:0%
number of schools monitored um or or or
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
subject to Lea monitoring um or are
 
04:39:22.029 --> 04:39:22.039 align:start position:0%
monitoring of school districts just to
 
04:39:25.629 --> 04:39:25.639 align:start position:0%
be clear um but perhaps uh Kelly if you
 
04:39:28.910 --> 04:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
want to speak to reasons why some uh
 
04:39:30.390 --> 04:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
public schools and school districts
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
choose not to participate in an
 
04:39:33.840 --> 04:39:36.310 align:start position:0%
choose not to participate in an
SLP

04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
SLP
 
04:39:38.830 --> 04:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um there are
 
04:39:40.350 --> 04:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
some schools that that do not
 
04:39:42.430 --> 04:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
participate um that that's their choice
 
04:39:45.590 --> 04:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
alone and to McKenzie's point before um
 
04:39:48.150 --> 04:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
it could be due to the fact that the
 
04:39:50.190 --> 04:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
regulations that have been made the
 
04:39:54.070 --> 04:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
participation has declined due to um the
 
04:39:56.590 --> 04:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
students taste pallets let's say so to
 
04:39:59.670 --> 04:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
speak um for for those particular
 
04:40:03.230 --> 04:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
schools okay thank you one follow yes
 
04:40:05.310 --> 04:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
thank you president chair um the last
 
04:40:07.868 --> 04:40:07.878 align:start position:0%
one the standards that you said that the
 
04:40:10.670 --> 04:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
department follows under the ons
 
04:40:13.390 --> 04:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
program the USDA
 
04:40:16.628 --> 04:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
regulations um how do they
 
04:40:19.590 --> 04:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
compare uh significantly or not to the
 
04:40:21.470 --> 04:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations that represent of the
 
04:40:24.990 --> 04:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:27.350 --> 04:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
regulations so you'll note in the in the
 
04:40:30.590 --> 04:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
build text um it it articulates Target
 
04:40:34.150 --> 04:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
levels um that are across the board I
 
04:40:35.990 --> 04:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
think one in excess of the current
 
04:40:38.590 --> 04:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
Target level so USDA set these Target
 
04:40:40.590 --> 04:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
levels there was a plan to move forward
 
04:40:42.190 --> 04:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
and Implement these Target levels that
 
04:40:45.788 --> 04:40:45.798 align:start position:0%
USDA did not execute um in part because
 
04:40:49.708 --> 04:40:49.718 align:start position:0%
of the current Supply supply chain
 
04:40:52.868 --> 04:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
constraints that would be exacerbated um
 
04:40:54.628 --> 04:40:54.638 align:start position:0%
by that I think it's also important to
 
04:40:57.390 --> 04:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
note that the supply chain um may or may
 
04:41:00.350 --> 04:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
not be responsive uh if our state
 
04:41:02.230 --> 04:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
requirements change because they are
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
used to National requirements
 
04:41:08.430 --> 04:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chair thank you any
 
04:41:08.440 --> 04:41:09.510 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chair thank you any
further

04:41:09.510 --> 04:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:41:12.390 --> 04:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
questions uh I have one last one for go

04:41:31.470 --> 04:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:35.070 --> 04:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
just um if what time we have here that's
 
04:41:37.030 --> 04:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
okay I can ask we may have the time for
 
04:41:39.150 --> 04:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
that okay uh I do have one for the
 
04:41:42.628 --> 04:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
Department um in looking at this bill
 
04:41:45.628 --> 04:41:45.638 align:start position:0%
and being responsible for the food
 
04:41:48.150 --> 04:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
service programs at the department have
 
04:41:50.470 --> 04:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
you seen any legislation similar to this
 
04:41:53.948 --> 04:41:53.958 align:start position:0%
in other states here in our country and
 
04:41:58.390 --> 04:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
if so um have you identified any issues
 
04:42:01.230 --> 04:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
or any both positive and negative that
 
04:42:03.230 --> 04:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
have come out of this program that we
 
04:42:05.470 --> 04:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
should know about
 
04:42:08.110 --> 04:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
we do not have any um best practices or
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
lessons learned from other states that
 
04:42:11.708 --> 04:42:11.718 align:start position:0%
have considered such proposals that's
 
04:42:13.788 --> 04:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
something that we could look into in our
 
04:42:17.190 --> 04:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
network of um similarly situated State
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
Education Agency nutrition
 
04:42:23.310 --> 04:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
programs thank you are there further
 
04:42:25.708 --> 04:42:25.718 align:start position:0%
questions of the
 
04:42:27.788 --> 04:42:27.798 align:start position:0%
department okay what we're going to do
 
04:42:29.708 --> 04:42:29.718 align:start position:0%
is to representative desay are you
 
04:42:31.590 --> 04:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
willing to come back to the chair and
 
04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
take another grueling
 
04:42:42.910 --> 04:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:47.628 --> 04:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
okay this hot thank you repres chair lad
 
04:42:49.750 --> 04:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative Dees for
 
04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question I promise you it's
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
not grueling um on page I guess it would
 
04:42:59.868 --> 04:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
be the actual text of the bill line 21
 
04:43:02.470 --> 04:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
nutrition standards for all foods sold
 
04:43:05.230 --> 04:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
outside of school meals um I'm thinking
 
04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
of bake sales carb nights pizza
 
04:43:15.270 --> 04:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
parties um are those now off the
 
04:43:17.830 --> 04:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
table I think that that's more related
 
04:43:20.670 --> 04:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
to um to fundraisers if uh if I remember
 
04:43:23.190 --> 04:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
correctly um so for example if like a
 
04:43:25.990 --> 04:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
school club wants to sell let's say well
 
04:43:27.670 --> 04:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
this is an issue we actually ran into in
 
04:43:29.430 --> 04:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
my high school so I can speak from
 
04:43:30.910 --> 04:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
experience being there you know just
 
04:43:33.270 --> 04:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
about six years ago is um there's only a
 
04:43:35.350 --> 04:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
certain allotment how much like pizza
 
04:43:37.310 --> 04:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
you can sell like club events or you
 
04:43:38.590 --> 04:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
know chocolate bars you can sell as a
 
04:43:40.670 --> 04:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
fundraiser right unhealthy food that you
 
04:43:43.150 --> 04:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
can sell so we used to have our Quiz Bow
 
04:43:44.510 --> 04:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
team which actually held our state
 
04:43:48.310 --> 04:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
championship in the lob every year um we
 
04:43:50.230 --> 04:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
would sell candy bars and other clubs
 
04:43:51.990 --> 04:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
because we would do our we took
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
precedence and we'd sell candy bars
 
04:43:54.708 --> 04:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
twice a year other clubs wouldn't be
 
04:43:57.150 --> 04:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
able to sell candy bars because our club
 
04:44:00.070 --> 04:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
utilized um the most uh the the
 
04:44:02.270 --> 04:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
allotment of candy that could be sold by
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
clubs during uh school hours I'm not
 
04:44:06.150 --> 04:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
sure I don't think it would affect the
 
04:44:08.910 --> 04:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
school district allowing clubs to sell
 
04:44:11.270 --> 04:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
for example like outside of school hours
 
04:44:13.470 --> 04:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
um to utilize facilities to have their
 
04:44:15.030 --> 04:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
own kind of private fundraisers or to
 
04:44:16.948 --> 04:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
get supplemental funding for a sports
 
04:44:18.270 --> 04:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
team I think it's just specific for
 
04:44:19.868 --> 04:44:19.878 align:start position:0%
what's happening during the school hours
 
04:44:22.030 --> 04:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
I could be mistaken though um that
 
04:44:23.510 --> 04:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
almost might be a better question for
 
04:44:27.670 --> 04:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education um
 
04:44:31.150 --> 04:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
so okay I understand your reluctance
 
04:44:31.160 --> 04:44:33.350 align:start position:0%
so okay I understand your reluctance
that's

04:44:33.350 --> 04:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:44:33.360 --> 04:44:36.390 align:start position:0%
that's
fine

04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:38.948 --> 04:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
okay well there's nothing else you know
 
04:44:40.788 --> 04:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
thank you and I have a lot of notes to
 
04:44:43.030 --> 04:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh to to attend to probably this evening
 
04:44:46.110 --> 04:44:46.120 align:start position:0%
and over the next few days so um but you
 
04:44:48.510 --> 04:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
have one more hand over represent or is
 
04:44:51.110 --> 04:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
that for me yes sir good um represent I
 
04:44:52.868 --> 04:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I'm clear on this
 
04:44:55.470 --> 04:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
as I look at this bill and and because
 
04:44:57.550 --> 04:44:57.560 align:start position:0%
think about what uh the representative
 
04:44:59.628 --> 04:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
across the room just
 
04:45:03.030 --> 04:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
said am I correct to assume that the
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
only information that that
 
04:45:07.788 --> 04:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
representative the Shay's uh bill is
 
04:45:10.590 --> 04:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
changing from current law is just the
 
04:45:12.590 --> 04:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
ones that italics inv
 
04:45:15.590 --> 04:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
Bol it's just I didn't get the last part
 
04:45:18.390 --> 04:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
no that wrong no I I I say I didn't hear
 
04:45:20.470 --> 04:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
what you said okay it's just the the
 
04:45:24.030 --> 04:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
italics part and the Bold the Bold
 
04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
italics is that the only part that
 
04:45:27.708 --> 04:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
represented the Shay's bill is actually
 
04:45:29.670 --> 04:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
changing no okay so the whole thing I
 
04:45:31.470 --> 04:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
don't think so okay the whole piece
 
04:45:33.230 --> 04:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a whole lot that's new
 
04:45:34.830 --> 04:45:34.840 align:start position:0%

thank you very much Mr chair and it's a
 
05:19:21.510 --> 05:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
pleasure to uh to be with uh with all of
 
05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
you esteemed uh committee colleagues
 
05:19:25.868 --> 05:19:25.878 align:start position:0%
this afternoon uh I know it's been a
 
05:19:27.750 --> 05:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
long day and we've got a couple of luno
 
05:19:30.590 --> 05:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
bills to uh to get through uh next and
 
05:19:33.110 --> 05:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
so we'll try to make these as uh as
 
05:19:36.310 --> 05:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
painless and as uh expeditious as
 
05:19:39.190 --> 05:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
possible so um again thank you it's
 
05:19:40.910 --> 05:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
great to join you for the record my name
 
05:19:42.708 --> 05:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
is Dave luno representing the people of
 
05:19:47.070 --> 05:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
hopkington and conquered um House Bill
 
05:19:49.948 --> 05:19:49.958 align:start position:0%
1684 uh is a simple bill and it's a
 
05:19:52.270 --> 05:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill and it's a bill
 
05:19:54.430 --> 05:19:54.440 align:start position:0%
that has integrity and
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
accountability and calls for honesty
 
05:19:59.708 --> 05:19:59.718 align:start position:0%
from our executive branch leaders who
 
05:20:01.910 --> 05:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
write budgets and spend tax
 
05:20:04.070 --> 05:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
money and it's a bill that will give
 
05:20:06.708 --> 05:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
lawmakers the chance to question these
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
Executives about how they spend or how
 
05:20:12.430 --> 05:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
they want to spend taxpayer money to
 
05:20:15.110 --> 05:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's being spent wisely
 
05:20:17.390 --> 05:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that we're not getting
 
05:20:20.310 --> 05:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
on a runaway
 
05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
train the education Freedom account
 
05:20:24.948 --> 05:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
program has the potential has the
 
05:20:27.750 --> 05:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
potential to become a train wreck and
 
05:20:30.190 --> 05:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
that's not good for anybody just in the
 
05:20:32.788 --> 05:20:32.798 align:start position:0%
first year of the program progam it's a
 
05:20:36.750 --> 05:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
Runway a runaway train in June back in
 
05:20:39.470 --> 05:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
June just a few months ago the
 
05:20:41.430 --> 05:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education recommended a
 
05:20:44.830 --> 05:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
budget for the education Freedom account
 
05:20:51.230 --> 05:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:54.030 --> 05:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
$129,000 but by November the cost had
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
already shot up to over $8
 
05:20:58.948 --> 05:20:58.958 align:start position:0%
million so how did this
 
05:21:01.708 --> 05:21:01.718 align:start position:0%
happen the department used participation
 
05:21:04.510 --> 05:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
rates based on similar program in
 
05:21:06.948 --> 05:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
Arizona the department had estimated
 
05:21:09.948 --> 05:21:09.958 align:start position:0%
that 75% of the students who participate
 
05:21:12.548 --> 05:21:12.558 align:start position:0%
would directly exit their public school
 
05:21:16.670 --> 05:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
for an EFA another 15% would uh who
 
05:21:18.470 --> 05:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
would already um would already be
 
05:21:20.868 --> 05:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
attending uh private schools when they
 
05:21:23.708 --> 05:21:23.718 align:start position:0%
take uh when they when they take an EFA
 
05:21:26.548 --> 05:21:26.558 align:start position:0%
and final 10% would be from
 
05:21:28.230 --> 05:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
homeschools According to the
 
05:21:30.830 --> 05:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
Department's budget information document
 
05:21:32.430 --> 05:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
the the savings Advantage for New
 
05:21:34.830 --> 05:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers is when an EFA
 
05:21:37.270 --> 05:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
student comes directly from their Public
 
05:21:39.948 --> 05:21:39.958 align:start position:0%
School presumably saving the local
 
05:21:42.110 --> 05:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer from having to pay
 
05:21:44.190 --> 05:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
their per pupil cost to educate the
 
05:21:47.110 --> 05:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
student and not costing the state any
 
05:21:49.590 --> 05:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
more than what it was already paying for
 
05:21:51.788 --> 05:21:51.798 align:start position:0%
that student in terms of
 
05:21:53.830 --> 05:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
adequacy dollars coming from the
 
05:21:57.390 --> 05:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and the cost for
 
05:21:59.670 --> 05:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
the private and homeschool students who
 
05:22:02.030 --> 05:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
take the EFA would not lead to any
 
05:22:04.948 --> 05:22:04.958 align:start position:0%
savings for local taxpayers and would in
 
05:22:07.150 --> 05:22:07.160 align:start position:0%
fact be new costs for the state
 
05:22:09.948 --> 05:22:09.958 align:start position:0%
amounting to between $4,000 and 8,000
 
05:22:11.910 --> 05:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
per student also coming from the
 
05:22:14.150 --> 05:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and that's all
 
05:22:16.510 --> 05:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
presented in the Department's um uh
 
05:22:19.830 --> 05:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
comprehensive long-term uh Financial
 
05:22:21.830 --> 05:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
projection but unfortunately that's not
 
05:22:24.548 --> 05:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
what happened as we learned in November
 
05:22:27.670 --> 05:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
only 177% of EFA students came from
 
05:22:29.948 --> 05:22:29.958 align:start position:0%
their Public Schools not
 
05:22:33.708 --> 05:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
75% and a whopping 83% were already
 
05:22:36.350 --> 05:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
students in private and home schools
 
05:22:37.830 --> 05:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
these students who had already made the
 
05:22:39.750 --> 05:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
choice to leave their Public Schools
 
05:22:42.350 --> 05:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
weren't costing the state a dime but now
 
05:22:45.150 --> 05:22:45.160 align:start position:0%
we're all paying for it so where could
 
05:22:46.590 --> 05:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
it go from
 
05:22:49.310 --> 05:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
here there are approximately and I'm
 
05:22:52.548 --> 05:22:52.558 align:start position:0%
rounding approximately 170,000 New
 
05:22:54.190 --> 05:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students who attend public
 
05:22:57.150 --> 05:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
schools grades K through 12 and there's
 
05:23:00.350 --> 05:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
another approximately 16,000 students
 
05:23:02.868 --> 05:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
who attend private schools and 3,000 who
 
05:23:02.878 --> 05:23:03.670 align:start position:0%
who attend private schools and 3,000 who
are

05:23:03.670 --> 05:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:23:05.868 --> 05:23:05.878 align:start position:0%
homeschooled and uh those numbers come
 
05:23:09.430 --> 05:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
from a from the doe um uh comprehensive
 
05:23:12.510 --> 05:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
model analysis as well and of those
 
05:23:14.708 --> 05:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
students in private and home schools
 
05:23:14.718 --> 05:23:15.628 align:start position:0%
students in private and home schools
maybe

05:23:15.628 --> 05:23:15.638 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
05:23:18.590 --> 05:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
75% are Income eligible under the
 
05:23:22.190 --> 05:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
current EFA law given this the director
 
05:23:24.390 --> 05:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
of legislative budget assistant office
 
05:23:26.868 --> 05:23:26.878 align:start position:0%
projects State exposure to be closer to
 
05:23:31.510 --> 05:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
$75 million a year a far cry from the 29
 
05:23:35.150 --> 05:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry $75 million a year a far cry
 
05:23:38.150 --> 05:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
from the 129,000
 
05:23:41.110 --> 05:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
projected the LBA concludes with a
 
05:23:43.548 --> 05:23:43.558 align:start position:0%
statement just to clarify this is in no
 
05:23:45.990 --> 05:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
way an estimate of the actual State
 
05:23:49.150 --> 05:23:49.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact and only illustrates the
 
05:23:51.948 --> 05:23:51.958 align:start position:0%
potential State exposure versus what doe
 
05:23:56.030 --> 05:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
assumptions are for non-public school
 
05:23:58.310 --> 05:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
students so this is where we can do
 
05:24:01.788 --> 05:24:01.798 align:start position:0%
better H Bill 1684 would stop The
 
05:24:04.470 --> 05:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
Runaway Train the department would be in
 
05:24:06.270 --> 05:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
the position to present and defend a
 
05:24:09.788 --> 05:24:09.798 align:start position:0%
budget that goes to the state objectives
 
05:24:12.230 --> 05:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
of the program for instance to provide
 
05:24:14.548 --> 05:24:14.558 align:start position:0%
students from low-income backgrounds
 
05:24:17.070 --> 05:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
access to educational op education
 
05:24:19.470 --> 05:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities outside of their public
 
05:24:21.788 --> 05:24:21.798 align:start position:0%
schools and the department could be
 
05:24:23.990 --> 05:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
questioned by lawmakers to make sure
 
05:24:26.350 --> 05:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money is actually being used to
 
05:24:28.910 --> 05:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
open doors for students and
 
05:24:31.030 --> 05:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
families I hope the committee will look
 
05:24:33.350 --> 05:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
favorably on truth and budgeting budget
 
05:24:35.470 --> 05:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
integrity and the obligation to spend
 
05:24:38.110 --> 05:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money wisely thank you for your
 
05:24:39.628 --> 05:24:39.638 align:start position:0%
time this afternoon I'm happy to take
 
05:24:39.638 --> 05:24:48.390 align:start position:0%
time this afternoon I'm happy to take
any

05:24:48.390 --> 05:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:51.390 --> 05:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
questions I have two questions if that's
 
05:24:54.510 --> 05:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
okay actually I have more but
 
05:24:54.520 --> 05:24:56.310 align:start position:0%
okay actually I have more but
I'll

05:24:56.310 --> 05:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
I'll
 
05:24:59.628 --> 05:24:59.638 align:start position:0%
um the parents who are homeschool you're
 
05:25:02.788 --> 05:25:02.798 align:start position:0%
talking about the increase cost um
 
05:25:05.030 --> 05:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
coming from the parents that the state
 
05:25:07.510 --> 05:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
is now having to spend more money for
 
05:25:09.788 --> 05:25:09.798 align:start position:0%
those homeschool parents aren't those
 
05:25:12.708 --> 05:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
homeschool parents paying taxes the same
 
05:25:15.310 --> 05:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
as everybody else and aren't they right
 
05:25:17.510 --> 05:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
now actually saving the local public
 
05:25:20.470 --> 05:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
schools money by not being in the public
 
05:25:22.070 --> 05:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
schools that's money that the public
 
05:25:23.510 --> 05:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
schools would have had to spend for
 
05:25:25.548 --> 05:25:25.558 align:start position:0%
those students but they're homeschooled
 
05:25:28.310 --> 05:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me that this is a a
 
05:25:31.750 --> 05:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
benefit and and if you're you often talk
 
05:25:35.548 --> 05:25:35.558 align:start position:0%
about fairness seems to me fair if a
 
05:25:37.510 --> 05:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
parent is paying all the taxes of
 
05:25:39.670 --> 05:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
everybody else the least they can get is
 
05:25:42.150 --> 05:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
the amount that the state spends for
 
05:25:44.030 --> 05:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
Education they're not taking the amount
 
05:25:47.910 --> 05:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
the local school spends so I mean I
 
05:25:47.920 --> 05:25:51.310 align:start position:0%
the local school spends so I mean I
don't

05:25:51.310 --> 05:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:53.670 --> 05:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
understand I don't understand how you
 
05:25:56.310 --> 05:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
can why you're coming down against the
 
05:25:59.708 --> 05:25:59.718 align:start position:0%
poor people who are are you know asking
 
05:26:02.390 --> 05:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
for this money when the state is running
 
05:26:06.230 --> 05:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
$120 million surplus at the moment why
 
05:26:08.030 --> 05:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
are we taking money away from poor
 
05:26:10.868 --> 05:26:10.878 align:start position:0%
people poor students who weren't able to
 
05:26:12.868 --> 05:26:12.878 align:start position:0%
get the appropriate education in their
 
05:26:15.628 --> 05:26:15.638 align:start position:0%
schools and ended up homeschooling or
 
05:26:18.670 --> 05:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
private schooling so um not coming down
 
05:26:21.190 --> 05:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
on that at all just it's completely
 
05:26:24.070 --> 05:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
completely inconsistent with the program
 
05:26:25.750 --> 05:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
as presented by the Department of
 
05:26:28.868 --> 05:26:28.878 align:start position:0%
Education where 75% of the students were
 
05:26:30.628 --> 05:26:30.638 align:start position:0%
going to be direct exits from their
 
05:26:32.750 --> 05:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
local public schools and provide
 
05:26:35.548 --> 05:26:35.558 align:start position:0%
immediate um uh reduction in local
 
05:26:38.190 --> 05:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayer obligations I'm not saying
 
05:26:41.868 --> 05:26:41.878 align:start position:0%
anything about about um whether or not
 
05:26:44.788 --> 05:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
whether or not homeschoolers should be
 
05:26:46.190 --> 05:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
should be getting these or private
 
05:26:47.990 --> 05:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
school kids should be getting these but
 
05:26:59.510 --> 05:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:59.520 --> 05:27:06.190 align:start position:0%
 
commissioner

05:27:06.190 --> 05:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:10.390 --> 05:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
oh your mic yeah as I understood the
 
05:27:13.470 --> 05:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
process when implementing the voucher
 
05:27:18.350 --> 05:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
system that only that the facult the
 
05:27:21.590 --> 05:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
school system got to retain 20% of the
 
05:27:24.868 --> 05:27:24.878 align:start position:0%
money from the local thing 80% went to
 
05:27:27.948 --> 05:27:27.958 align:start position:0%
the but all of the state and federal
 
05:27:30.510 --> 05:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
money went to the school system from
 
05:27:32.150 --> 05:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
from which that student so they still
 
05:27:35.390 --> 05:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
got all of that money with no cuts and
 
05:27:37.990 --> 05:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't have to instruct a student
 
05:27:42.470 --> 05:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't sound as destructive as it
 
05:27:44.628 --> 05:27:44.638 align:start position:0%
sounds as you presented and I don't mean
 
05:27:46.230 --> 05:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
that in a majority thing about what you
 
05:27:48.948 --> 05:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
said it's just the numbers it it sounds
 
05:27:51.548 --> 05:27:51.558 align:start position:0%
to me like the impact is
 
05:27:54.070 --> 05:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
less can I interject for just a second
 
05:27:57.750 --> 05:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
please yes uh the the the numbers you're
 
05:28:01.230 --> 05:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
just uh mentioning and alluding to come
 
05:28:02.510 --> 05:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
from HB
 
05:28:05.230 --> 05:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
607 okay yeah it's a different bill
 
05:28:07.190 --> 05:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
that's the local education Freedom
 
05:28:09.670 --> 05:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
account first okay the freedom account I
 
05:28:12.590 --> 05:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
would be happy to to address what the
 
05:28:18.030 --> 05:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:20.270 --> 05:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
incremental oh
 
05:28:29.390 --> 05:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:29.400 --> 05:28:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
off

05:28:41.750 --> 05:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:41.760 --> 05:28:44.390 align:start position:0%
 
I

05:28:44.390 --> 05:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:59.310 --> 05:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:59.320 --> 05:29:29.310 align:start position:0%
 
bit

05:29:29.310 --> 05:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:29.320 --> 05:29:32.350 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:29:32.350 --> 05:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:32.360 --> 05:29:36.350 align:start position:0%
 
hello

05:29:36.350 --> 05:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:40.548 --> 05:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
hello thanks thanks oliv just thanks
 
05:29:43.310 --> 05:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
Oliver yeah th this uh this works good
 
05:29:47.030 --> 05:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
thanks um so there there is a provision
 
05:29:51.310 --> 05:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
in hb2 stemming from the hb20 language
 
05:29:55.030 --> 05:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
that that does provide for a um for for
 
05:29:58.270 --> 05:29:58.280 align:start position:0%
um for school districts where an EFA
 
05:30:00.910 --> 05:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
student is a direct exit out of that
 
05:30:03.510 --> 05:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
school district where there's a um where
 
05:30:06.708 --> 05:30:06.718 align:start position:0%
there's a a taper of the um of the
 
05:30:09.990 --> 05:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy um loss inadequacy dollars from
 
05:30:12.590 --> 05:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
the state and that tapers off I forget
 
05:30:14.788 --> 05:30:14.798 align:start position:0%
after two or three years something like
 
05:30:20.070 --> 05:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
that um um there also the um I'm not an
 
05:30:24.430 --> 05:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
expert on the uh the idea the federal
 
05:30:28.110 --> 05:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
dollars but um but if the students gone
 
05:30:29.708 --> 05:30:29.718 align:start position:0%
from the public school districts I don't
 
05:30:32.030 --> 05:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
I don't believe believe that the uh that
 
05:30:33.830 --> 05:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
the school district continues to receive
 
05:30:41.788 --> 05:30:41.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:45.750 --> 05:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
Ida not not in not in the hb2 EFA
 
05:30:49.110 --> 05:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
program so so I we're referencing 607
 
05:30:51.030 --> 05:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
again I think the 6 in 607 they are
 
05:30:53.910 --> 05:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
still in the ADM but not in yeah yeah
 
05:30:55.830 --> 05:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
but but I but those are good questions
 
05:30:57.788 --> 05:30:57.798 align:start position:0%
but along those same same lines
 
05:31:00.750 --> 05:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative Ford um
 
05:31:03.788 --> 05:31:03.798 align:start position:0%
I think what um what what this
 
05:31:12.150 --> 05:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:15.788 --> 05:31:15.798 align:start position:0%
that thanks that the that the thank you
 
05:31:18.070 --> 05:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
very much that the draw of the program
 
05:31:21.190 --> 05:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily from um from public
 
05:31:24.270 --> 05:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
schools as it was presented being 75%
 
05:31:26.830 --> 05:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
being a draw from from public schools
 
05:31:30.390 --> 05:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's 83% at least from this initial
 
05:31:33.190 --> 05:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
Year's experience coming from non-public
 
05:31:36.310 --> 05:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
school students and uh and that's really
 
05:31:38.708 --> 05:31:38.718 align:start position:0%
where State impact
 
05:31:41.150 --> 05:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
costs uh become significant because if
 
05:31:43.230 --> 05:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
it's a if it's from a public school it's
 
05:31:45.948 --> 05:31:45.958 align:start position:0%
a push the state either sends the
 
05:31:47.670 --> 05:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
adequacy payment to the public school or
 
05:31:50.190 --> 05:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
to the EA but when the student comes
 
05:31:52.510 --> 05:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
from a private school or a home school
 
05:31:54.830 --> 05:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's a new obligation that the state
 
05:31:57.590 --> 05:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
is taking on uh out of the education
 
05:32:00.150 --> 05:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
trust fund which isn't like just sort of
 
05:32:03.150 --> 05:32:03.160 align:start position:0%
of money growing on trees the EFA is a
 
05:32:05.990 --> 05:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
is a budgeted amount and it's budgeted
 
05:32:09.190 --> 05:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
based on the um the um the the
 
05:32:10.430 --> 05:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
projections that come from the
 
05:32:13.310 --> 05:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
Department of of education for public
 
05:32:16.230 --> 05:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
schools and the projection that comes
 
05:32:17.990 --> 05:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education for
 
05:32:21.948 --> 05:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
efas and so when an EFA is is under
 
05:32:25.548 --> 05:32:25.558 align:start position:0%
budgeted by by nearly $8 million as it
 
05:32:28.350 --> 05:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
was this time um that puts a that puts a
 
05:32:30.430 --> 05:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
strain on the education trust fund that
 
05:32:38.948 --> 05:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:41.150 --> 05:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
handle further questions from the
 
05:32:43.750 --> 05:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
presenter from the committee represent
 
05:32:48.868 --> 05:32:48.878 align:start position:0%

05:33:22.910 --> 05:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
and3 do those numbers include phas as
 
05:33:26.670 --> 05:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
well for local school
 
05:33:29.670 --> 05:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
districts oh good question on that I
 
05:33:32.070 --> 05:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
don't think they do because I took those
 
05:33:35.310 --> 05:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
directly out of the
 
05:33:40.070 --> 05:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
um I took those directly out of the the
 
05:33:43.390 --> 05:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
Department's um uh budget spreadsheets
 
05:33:45.910 --> 05:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
which I which I sent around so so for
 
05:33:48.150 --> 05:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
example the the
 
05:33:53.830 --> 05:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
129,000 is uh is um is the sum of the uh
 
05:33:55.948 --> 05:33:55.958 align:start position:0%
i' I've circled a a package of numbers
 
05:33:57.990 --> 05:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
and you could see public uh public
 
05:34:00.310 --> 05:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
school to non-public option non public
 
05:34:02.430 --> 05:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
school and then home education it's the
 
05:34:05.350 --> 05:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
sum of those um those three three
 
05:34:06.868 --> 05:34:06.878 align:start position:0%
numbers there so it doesn't include the
 
05:34:10.830 --> 05:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
taper but but then again the the taper
 
05:34:14.868 --> 05:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
um rather than affecting 75% of the uh
 
05:34:18.548 --> 05:34:18.558 align:start position:0%
of the students is only affecting 133%
 
05:34:21.708 --> 05:34:21.718 align:start position:0%
of the U I'm sorry 17% of the students
 
05:34:25.350 --> 05:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
so um so it would it would likely be a
 
05:34:28.070 --> 05:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
much more diminus uh number but but
 
05:34:29.310 --> 05:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
something that certainly should be
 
05:34:29.320 --> 05:34:34.470 align:start position:0%
something that certainly should be
considered

05:34:34.470 --> 05:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:37.270 --> 05:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
05:34:42.590 --> 05:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
um since these um amounts uh affect uh
 
05:34:44.470 --> 05:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
22 and
 
05:34:48.030 --> 05:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
23 um1
 
05:34:51.830 --> 05:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
129,000 uh dollar uh for
 
05:34:56.110 --> 05:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
22 um what happens to the children who
 
05:35:00.430 --> 05:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
have received uh EFA funds already ready
 
05:35:07.430 --> 05:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:10.750 --> 05:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
$129,000 yeah so again I think that's uh
 
05:35:12.310 --> 05:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's an important uh
 
05:35:14.750 --> 05:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
consideration to make because uh if the
 
05:35:17.590 --> 05:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh if the mone's already you know um you
 
05:35:20.070 --> 05:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
know left the education trust fund for
 
05:35:22.788 --> 05:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
the for the efas it's uh not likely
 
05:35:24.070 --> 05:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to claw that
 
05:35:27.990 --> 05:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
back and um and I think um certainly uh
 
05:35:29.830 --> 05:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
provision could be could be put in place
 
05:35:32.910 --> 05:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
place where where where maybe that cap
 
05:35:37.470 --> 05:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
starts in um in in FY 23 or something
 
05:35:50.510 --> 05:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:52.910 --> 05:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
that yeah thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:35:54.350 --> 05:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
representative luno for taking my
 
05:35:57.230 --> 05:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
question and um and thank you for
 
05:35:59.390 --> 05:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
flagging the numbers that you flagged
 
05:36:01.750 --> 05:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
because it's a very legitimate uh
 
05:36:03.510 --> 05:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
situation that does need attention but I
 
05:36:04.670 --> 05:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
want to follow up a little bit on
 
05:36:07.948 --> 05:36:07.958 align:start position:0%
representative cordell's concern which I
 
05:36:10.190 --> 05:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
share I think you share we all share is
 
05:36:13.190 --> 05:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
to would a measure that like this or an
 
05:36:15.390 --> 05:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
amended measure like this move forward
 
05:36:18.350 --> 05:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
what happens to the students that are
 
05:36:20.310 --> 05:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
commit the current or prospective
 
05:36:23.948 --> 05:36:23.958 align:start position:0%
students that are looking at EFA
 
05:36:27.270 --> 05:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities and uh there are obviously
 
05:36:29.830 --> 05:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
there are the reasons that students from
 
05:36:31.868 --> 05:36:31.878 align:start position:0%
wherever they come from are their
 
05:36:34.110 --> 05:36:34.120 align:start position:0%
families are opting for efas or for
 
05:36:36.430 --> 05:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
safety reasons or whatever is best for
 
05:36:39.390 --> 05:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
the student so if if you given any
 
05:36:41.590 --> 05:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
thought as to to follow up on the
 
05:36:42.910 --> 05:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
previous question if you given any
 
05:36:46.390 --> 05:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
thought as the criteria for severing
 
05:36:49.990 --> 05:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
students from the EFA program who uh are
 
05:36:52.708 --> 05:36:52.718 align:start position:0%
in that because I think that if this
 
05:36:54.110 --> 05:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
moves forward then there would have to
 
05:36:57.230 --> 05:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
be a process and criteria for severing
 
05:36:59.390 --> 05:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
students from the program is there been
 
05:37:01.750 --> 05:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
any consideration or a plan for that you
 
05:37:03.708 --> 05:37:03.718 align:start position:0%
know not really I think that's a great
 
05:37:06.350 --> 05:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
question representative Moffett um uh
 
05:37:07.990 --> 05:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that's something that uh
 
05:37:09.990 --> 05:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
that I'd be delighted to work with uh
 
05:37:12.230 --> 05:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
with this Committee in in terms of of
 
05:37:14.350 --> 05:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
putting together and again when you when
 
05:37:16.750 --> 05:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
you take a look at the the you know the
 
05:37:19.868 --> 05:37:19.878 align:start position:0%
recur the the the the theme of this
 
05:37:22.510 --> 05:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
effort it's to stop a train
 
05:37:25.110 --> 05:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
wreck uh I think we would probably all
 
05:37:28.990 --> 05:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
agree if uh if if this um you know went
 
05:37:33.510 --> 05:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
to to to you know perhaps the uh uh to
 
05:37:36.868 --> 05:37:36.878 align:start position:0%
the to the extent of uh of of of of
 
05:37:41.510 --> 05:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
State exposure that the LBA had um had
 
05:37:44.190 --> 05:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
identified that that that would be an
 
05:37:46.990 --> 05:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
unsustainable and and untenable position
 
05:37:49.390 --> 05:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
so I think it would be important to uh
 
05:37:52.230 --> 05:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
to stop it before it gets that far so
 
05:37:55.310 --> 05:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
it's obviously gotten gotten uh gotten
 
05:37:57.030 --> 05:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
pretty far out of hand even in this
 
05:38:00.990 --> 05:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
first year 129,000 to almost $8.1
 
05:38:05.350 --> 05:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
million so um and uh and and and not as
 
05:38:08.510 --> 05:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
a result of Public School uh student
 
05:38:11.150 --> 05:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
exits but as a result of private and
 
05:38:14.470 --> 05:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
home um uh participation in the uh in
 
05:38:17.430 --> 05:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
the program so um so I think there's
 
05:38:19.830 --> 05:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
probably a number of ways that that
 
05:38:22.470 --> 05:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
could um could could provide support for
 
05:38:25.670 --> 05:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
these um for these students uh uh also
 
05:38:29.070 --> 05:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind that um that that these
 
05:38:31.070 --> 05:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
students and their families and I and I
 
05:38:36.468 --> 05:38:36.478 align:start position:0%
certainly am am not trying to to to um
 
05:38:39.990 --> 05:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
underestimate the the the the struggle
 
05:38:43.150 --> 05:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
and and commitment and effort that
 
05:38:47.430 --> 05:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
families put in to uh to educating their
 
05:38:50.150 --> 05:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
um their their children but uh but these
 
05:38:51.948 --> 05:38:51.958 align:start position:0%
weren't these weren't kids that that
 
05:38:53.230 --> 05:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
were just pulled out of their public
 
05:38:55.708 --> 05:38:55.718 align:start position:0%
schools these are students who who had
 
05:38:59.628 --> 05:38:59.638 align:start position:0%
been in a non-public school situation
 
05:39:03.948 --> 05:39:03.958 align:start position:0%
prior to the uh the um um U offering of
 
05:39:06.030 --> 05:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
the EFA
 
05:39:11.430 --> 05:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:15.150 --> 05:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
you I wonder your objection to having
 
05:39:17.190 --> 05:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
every single student in the state if
 
05:39:19.350 --> 05:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
that's what if that's who decides to use
 
05:39:21.708 --> 05:39:21.718 align:start position:0%
this to use this because isn't the state
 
05:39:24.190 --> 05:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to provide the opportunity for
 
05:39:26.350 --> 05:39:26.360 align:start position:0%
an adequate education for every single
 
05:39:29.830 --> 05:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
student and isn't $4,000 an awful small
 
05:39:32.510 --> 05:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
amount to have to pay to provide that if
 
05:39:34.788 --> 05:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
every single student decides this if our
 
05:39:36.868 --> 05:39:36.878 align:start position:0%
train goes down the track far enough
 
05:39:39.110 --> 05:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
that every single student decides to use
 
05:39:42.310 --> 05:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
it aren't we in effect saving money if
 
05:39:44.310 --> 05:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
money is what you're worried about and
 
05:39:46.030 --> 05:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
if educating students is what you're
 
05:39:48.830 --> 05:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
worried about then that's a pretty cheap
 
05:39:52.110 --> 05:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
education yeah I'd say I'd say $4,000
 
05:39:54.430 --> 05:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
does get you a pretty cheap education
 
05:39:56.230 --> 05:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
and we'll uh we'll talk about that some
 
05:39:58.590 --> 05:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
more I think in the next um in the next
 
05:40:00.110 --> 05:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
bill we're going to we're going to hear
 
05:40:04.628 --> 05:40:04.638 align:start position:0%
this afternoon but um but uh to be to be
 
05:40:06.868 --> 05:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
uh to be clear the state does not have
 
05:40:08.548 --> 05:40:08.558 align:start position:0%
an obligation a constitutional
 
05:40:11.350 --> 05:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
obligation to to provide an adequate
 
05:40:13.350 --> 05:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
education for every child in New
 
05:40:15.150 --> 05:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it has an it has a
 
05:40:17.670 --> 05:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to cherish
 
05:40:20.190 --> 05:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
Public Schools that's those are the
 
05:40:22.788 --> 05:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
exact words from the Constitution and
 
05:40:24.510 --> 05:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
that's very different than what you're
 
05:40:24.520 --> 05:40:27.670 align:start position:0%
that's very different than what you're
talking

05:40:27.670 --> 05:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:30.670 --> 05:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
about yes um um I just wonder what the
 
05:40:32.590 --> 05:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
definition of public schools because it
 
05:40:34.670 --> 05:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
seems to me that if the public is paying
 
05:40:38.110 --> 05:40:38.120 align:start position:0%
for the education it is a public school
 
05:40:40.030 --> 05:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
whether it is a building funded by a
 
05:40:47.708 --> 05:40:47.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:50.590 --> 05:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
state that sounded like debate to me
 
05:40:52.788 --> 05:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
that was a question I said I wonder at
 
05:40:54.628 --> 05:40:54.638 align:start position:0%
that at your
 
05:40:58.230 --> 05:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
definition so what is your definition of
 
05:41:00.030 --> 05:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
public education yeah I think the
 
05:41:02.350 --> 05:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
definition of public schools is pretty
 
05:41:04.830 --> 05:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
well understood it's uh pretty well
 
05:41:06.868 --> 05:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
defined in
 
05:41:10.628 --> 05:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
statute and um uh and I think there's
 
05:41:13.350 --> 05:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
there's pretty clear definition uh
 
05:41:15.788 --> 05:41:15.798 align:start position:0%
between Public School Public Charter
 
05:41:19.110 --> 05:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
School um uh I think homeschooling is in
 
05:41:21.910 --> 05:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
the statute I think private schools are
 
05:41:25.868 --> 05:41:25.878 align:start position:0%
also in in statute so um so I I I think
 
05:41:28.990 --> 05:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uh definition on that
 
05:41:30.750 --> 05:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
but uh but I'm not an attorney
 
05:41:33.350 --> 05:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative leakas so uh so I would
 
05:41:38.150 --> 05:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
certainly um um you know defer to uh to
 
05:41:39.750 --> 05:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know an an attorney from the
 
05:41:42.310 --> 05:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
Department if um if attorney Fenton is
 
05:41:47.030 --> 05:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:49.910 --> 05:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon I do thank you uh chairman L I
 
05:41:53.190 --> 05:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
can't even see him that may be a good
 
05:41:55.510 --> 05:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
thing repres little yeah we have that
 
05:41:58.150 --> 05:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
problem here it's uh dodging um I just
 
05:42:00.150 --> 05:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I'm accurate on
 
05:42:03.868 --> 05:42:03.878 align:start position:0%
this the EFA and if if I get representa
 
05:42:05.150 --> 05:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
light if I get the wrong bill please
 
05:42:09.070 --> 05:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
stop me um using your numbers the EFA
 
05:42:12.230 --> 05:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
that that's currently inv vog uh that
 
05:42:15.708 --> 05:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
has expended this money was actually
 
05:42:17.708 --> 05:42:17.718 align:start position:0%
identifi for a small number of
 
05:42:19.868 --> 05:42:19.878 align:start position:0%
youngsters um hopefully a small number
 
05:42:21.708 --> 05:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
of youngsters that were coming from
 
05:42:24.990 --> 05:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
Public School uh and looking the data
 
05:42:27.310 --> 05:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
you have here and the things I've read
 
05:42:30.868 --> 05:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
myself you're talking 83 84% I'd heard
 
05:42:33.230 --> 05:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
um those youngsters were not even in the
 
05:42:37.230 --> 05:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
public schools so the deficit is cost is
 
05:42:39.628 --> 05:42:39.638 align:start position:0%
caused if I understand this correctly by
 
05:42:41.270 --> 05:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
folks that were not ever enrolled at
 
05:42:43.830 --> 05:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
that time in the public school so is
 
05:42:46.070 --> 05:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
that accurate that's that's correct okay
 
05:42:48.628 --> 05:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
so the second part is on these two
 
05:42:50.390 --> 05:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
numbers you have here the 129 which may
 
05:42:51.868 --> 05:42:51.878 align:start position:0%
be a legitimate number for the the
 
05:42:53.150 --> 05:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
number that the commissioner had thought
 
05:42:55.830 --> 05:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
might participate um so basically just
 
05:42:58.628 --> 05:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
funding people who weren't here but the
 
05:43:01.190 --> 05:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
8 $8 million you have identified as the
 
05:43:03.750 --> 05:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
actual cost as of this writing this
 
05:43:06.070 --> 05:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
document how where does that deficit
 
05:43:08.190 --> 05:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
come from where how no where's the
 
05:43:09.830 --> 05:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
repayment or the
 
05:43:12.310 --> 05:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
funding for that money come from thank
 
05:43:13.708 --> 05:43:13.718 align:start position:0%
you for the uh for the question
 
05:43:16.030 --> 05:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock um and that's
 
05:43:19.350 --> 05:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
that's um sort of what I was what I was
 
05:43:22.110 --> 05:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
um um you know talking about when I was
 
05:43:23.910 --> 05:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh when I was addressing representative
 
05:43:26.430 --> 05:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
Ford's question that the education trust
 
05:43:29.750 --> 05:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
fund which is used to provide all of the
 
05:43:33.750 --> 05:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
state's adequacy um payments to to all
 
05:43:38.150 --> 05:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
of our school districts uh and uh and uh
 
05:43:41.230 --> 05:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
provides the uh the funding of uh of
 
05:43:44.270 --> 05:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
efas that's a limited fund that's it's
 
05:43:47.350 --> 05:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
not the it's um it's it's something
 
05:43:50.350 --> 05:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
that's budgeted by the the finance uh
 
05:43:52.868 --> 05:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
committee uh perhaps representative
 
05:43:55.310 --> 05:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
walls might uh might might be able to
 
05:43:58.390 --> 05:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
shed shed a little bit of process light
 
05:44:01.110 --> 05:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh on it but um the education trust fund
 
05:44:04.788 --> 05:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
is not the state's general fund um it's
 
05:44:08.190 --> 05:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
um it's it's um it's budgeted based on
 
05:44:11.510 --> 05:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
what the doe uh projects as being its
 
05:44:14.708 --> 05:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
Public School adequacy payment needs for
 
05:44:19.030 --> 05:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
the banum plus uh any additional needs
 
05:44:21.910 --> 05:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
that um that are funded through the the
 
05:44:26.070 --> 05:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
ETF uh including U the the education
 
05:44:29.030 --> 05:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts and so when a budget is
 
05:44:29.040 --> 05:44:31.110 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts and so when a budget is
off

05:44:31.110 --> 05:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
off
 
05:44:35.150 --> 05:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
by almost by $8 million in uh in this
 
05:44:38.030 --> 05:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
case uh either an additional
 
05:44:39.830 --> 05:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation has to be made from the
 
05:44:41.910 --> 05:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
general fund to be put into the
 
05:44:44.910 --> 05:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
education trust fund or uh or something
 
05:44:47.430 --> 05:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
else get squeezed and uh one of the
 
05:44:49.510 --> 05:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
things that that have been have been
 
05:44:52.670 --> 05:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
squeezed in the past is um is special
 
05:44:54.910 --> 05:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
education Aid which used to be called
 
05:44:56.510 --> 05:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid in New Hampshire I
 
05:44:58.708 --> 05:44:58.718 align:start position:0%
believe the title was changed just a few
 
05:45:03.270 --> 05:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh years ago but um but um uh when when
 
05:45:05.230 --> 05:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
funds are not sufficient in the
 
05:45:07.910 --> 05:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
education trust fund to reimburse uh
 
05:45:10.030 --> 05:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
school districts for special education
 
05:45:12.230 --> 05:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
costs that gets
 
05:45:14.510 --> 05:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
pro-rated so there's an example of where
 
05:45:16.310 --> 05:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
it gets
 
05:45:21.150 --> 05:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:24.030 --> 05:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
chairman yes I'm wondering in the those
 
05:45:26.468 --> 05:45:26.478 align:start position:0%
that came from private schools or P or
 
05:45:29.350 --> 05:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
um home schools and those that came from
 
05:45:29.360 --> 05:45:31.750 align:start position:0%
um home schools and those that came from
from

05:45:31.750 --> 05:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:45:34.628 --> 05:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
um town schools I'm
 
05:45:37.468 --> 05:45:37.478 align:start position:0%
wondering have you looked at how many of
 
05:45:39.750 --> 05:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
them had originally been or a family
 
05:45:42.150 --> 05:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
member had originally been in the public
 
05:45:45.590 --> 05:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
schools and had had left before that
 
05:45:47.430 --> 05:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
because they weren't getting an adequate
 
05:45:50.150 --> 05:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
education so thank you I I have not
 
05:45:52.110 --> 05:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
because that information has not been
 
05:45:53.750 --> 05:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
released by the department I'm not even
 
05:45:55.868 --> 05:45:55.878 align:start position:0%
sure it was collected by the department
 
05:45:58.948 --> 05:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
but I would be very interested in uh in
 
05:46:01.590 --> 05:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
and having a better understanding of uh
 
05:46:04.110 --> 05:46:04.120 align:start position:0%
of exactly what those circumstances uh
 
05:46:08.350 --> 05:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
were or are and um and um but and thank
 
05:46:10.510 --> 05:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
you very much and I hope you'd uh you'd
 
05:46:13.030 --> 05:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
you'd support the department providing
 
05:46:13.040 --> 05:46:13.750 align:start position:0%
you'd support the department providing
that

05:46:13.750 --> 05:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:46:23.150 --> 05:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:27.788 --> 05:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:27.798 --> 05:46:57.708 align:start position:0%
 
much

05:46:57.708 --> 05:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:57.718 --> 05:47:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
for

05:47:03.510 --> 05:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:07.350 --> 05:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
did I do this right oh I did um good
 
05:47:09.270 --> 05:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon representatives and thank you
 
05:47:11.548 --> 05:47:11.558 align:start position:0%

1684 education Freedom accounts is
 
05:47:18.510 --> 05:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
access to the freedom for parents and
 
05:47:20.150 --> 05:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
Guardians to choose the best learning
 
05:47:22.270 --> 05:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
environment for their CH for their child
 
05:47:22.280 --> 05:47:23.750 align:start position:0%
environment for their CH for their child
or

05:47:23.750 --> 05:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:47:27.708 --> 05:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:30.430 --> 05:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
freedom of the parents and Guardians to
 
05:47:32.110 --> 05:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
choose the best learning environment for
 
05:47:33.590 --> 05:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
their child or children it is the
 
05:47:35.230 --> 05:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
freedom to have a small percentage of
 
05:47:37.548 --> 05:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
the tuition rate of a child to have the
 
05:47:39.708 --> 05:47:39.718 align:start position:0%
option to attend private or Charter
 
05:47:42.110 --> 05:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
Schools or even homeschooling without
 
05:47:44.670 --> 05:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
education Freedom we are expected that
 
05:47:46.270 --> 05:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
learning as a one- siiz
 
05:47:50.468 --> 05:47:50.478 align:start position:0%
fits-all approach is is the only major
 
05:47:53.310 --> 05:47:53.320 align:start position:0%
option did you know that house spill
 
05:47:55.910 --> 05:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
1684 would cut the opportunity for at
 
05:47:55.920 --> 05:47:57.350 align:start position:0%
1684 would cut the opportunity for at
about

05:47:57.350 --> 05:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:48:00.190 --> 05:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
1,856 children children down to 26
 
05:48:02.350 --> 05:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
children in
 
05:48:04.948 --> 05:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
total where is the fairness and equality
 
05:48:07.430 --> 05:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
in that 100% normally received in
 
05:48:10.708 --> 05:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
funding by by the public education
 
05:48:14.468 --> 05:48:14.478 align:start position:0%
system of that only 30% would go towards
 
05:48:16.510 --> 05:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
the families for the education Freedom
 
05:48:19.548 --> 05:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
account 70% of the funding Still Remains
 
05:48:21.670 --> 05:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
in the public homeschool District of
 
05:48:23.430 --> 05:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
that child which means they have
 
05:48:26.468 --> 05:48:26.478 align:start position:0%
additional funding for one less child
 
05:48:29.868 --> 05:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
house bill would cut that down again
 
05:48:32.510 --> 05:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
1,856 students currently being able to
 
05:48:35.110 --> 05:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
have the education freedom to attend the
 
05:48:37.190 --> 05:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
best learning environment for them would
 
05:48:40.430 --> 05:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
cut down to 26 will any one of you be
 
05:48:42.350 --> 05:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
one of the ones to tell them that they
 
05:48:44.468 --> 05:48:44.478 align:start position:0%
cannot get their best educational
 
05:48:47.190 --> 05:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
advancements I sure hope that I wouldn't
 
05:48:49.468 --> 05:48:49.478 align:start position:0%
be one of those this program is not only
 
05:48:51.230 --> 05:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
an amazing opportunity for students
 
05:48:52.548 --> 05:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire but it's
 
05:48:54.270 --> 05:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
necessary for their educational best
 
05:48:56.750 --> 05:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
interests now let me take a brief moment
 
05:48:58.910 --> 05:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
to explain a personal situation for
 
05:49:01.270 --> 05:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
myself and my children I'm a parent of
 
05:49:04.270 --> 05:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
two Nash School District children one of
 
05:49:07.310 --> 05:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
which has a 504 and the other has an i
 
05:49:09.510 --> 05:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
one of my children does exceptionally
 
05:49:12.350 --> 05:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
well in public education the other child
 
05:49:14.548 --> 05:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
however struggles they've struggled
 
05:49:16.310 --> 05:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
through the course of this pandemic
 
05:49:18.270 --> 05:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
they've struggled with un enforcement of
 
05:49:20.910 --> 05:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
the 504 program which has led me to a
 
05:49:22.430 --> 05:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
place where I feel that the best
 
05:49:25.030 --> 05:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
educational investment for my child is
 
05:49:26.948 --> 05:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
not the public school system for our
 
05:49:29.990 --> 05:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
youngest it may or may not be a montau
 
05:49:32.670 --> 05:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
based school or a charter school or even
 
05:49:35.670 --> 05:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
a private school at that matter or even
 
05:49:38.190 --> 05:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
homeschooling here is the problem I am a
 
05:49:41.150 --> 05:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
single parent I make less than most of
 
05:49:42.788 --> 05:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
the most of the people that are
 
05:49:45.430 --> 05:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
qualified to appropriately send their
 
05:49:47.868 --> 05:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
child to private or charter schools
 
05:49:49.510 --> 05:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
because a lot of people that are in
 
05:49:52.030 --> 05:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
those Realms that uh representative luno
 
05:49:53.708 --> 05:49:53.718 align:start position:0%
had mentioned before that were already
 
05:49:56.628 --> 05:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
in the private or Charter section they
 
05:49:58.830 --> 05:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
were able to afford that without
 
05:50:00.868 --> 05:50:00.878 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts and the
 
05:50:02.948 --> 05:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund my children
 
05:50:05.270 --> 05:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
will not only not be able to attend
 
05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
those schools it's not even an option
 
05:50:09.350 --> 05:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
for a family Like
 
05:50:12.590 --> 05:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
Mine by limiting the budget on this
 
05:50:14.750 --> 05:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
particular bill you are limiting not
 
05:50:17.070 --> 05:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
just the budgetary options like I said
 
05:50:19.510 --> 05:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
before out of 100% of what the
 
05:50:21.948 --> 05:50:21.958 align:start position:0%
homeschool District receives in funding
 
05:50:24.390 --> 05:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
only 30% of that goes towards the
 
05:50:27.110 --> 05:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account for the family
 
05:50:31.390 --> 05:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
only 30% that still leaves 70% of the
 
05:50:33.750 --> 05:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
total amount for that tuition cost to
 
05:50:35.190 --> 05:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
remain in the district and they're
 
05:50:37.830 --> 05:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
teaching one less student that seems
 
05:50:39.990 --> 05:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
like a very good benefit to me when you
 
05:50:42.270 --> 05:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
think about the public education system
 
05:50:44.150 --> 05:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
currently the public education system is
 
05:50:46.788 --> 05:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
designed for a one-size fits-all out of
 
05:50:46.798 --> 05:50:48.430 align:start position:0%
designed for a one-size fits-all out of
those

05:50:48.430 --> 05:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:50:51.548 --> 05:50:51.558 align:start position:0%
1,856 children in the program right
 
05:50:55.310 --> 05:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
now do you really feel that only 26 of
 
05:50:56.830 --> 05:50:56.840 align:start position:0%
those families know what's best for
 
05:51:00.310 --> 05:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
their children no there are so many more
 
05:51:02.030 --> 05:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
and by limiting the opportunity to
 
05:51:03.788 --> 05:51:03.798 align:start position:0%
participate in an education Freedom
 
05:51:05.868 --> 05:51:05.878 align:start position:0%
account by putting a budget and a small
 
05:51:08.548 --> 05:51:08.558 align:start position:0%
budget is irrational and completely
 
05:51:10.150 --> 05:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
unconscionable when you think about what
 
05:51:12.430 --> 05:51:12.440 align:start position:0%
is the best interest of the children I
 
05:51:13.990 --> 05:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
want to close with I know that
 
05:51:15.990 --> 05:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative luno had stated earlier
 
05:51:18.030 --> 05:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
the words consist inconsistency and
 
05:51:20.350 --> 05:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
train wreck given the inconsistency in
 
05:51:22.788 --> 05:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
many districts throughout this past two
 
05:51:25.510 --> 05:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
years and what the public education
 
05:51:28.350 --> 05:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
system has unveiled to the parents with
 
05:51:30.788 --> 05:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
within those Educational Systems it is
 
05:51:32.830 --> 05:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
already an educational train wreck for
 
05:51:34.628 --> 05:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
students who do not fit into the public
 
05:51:36.910 --> 05:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
education one siiz fits-all please vote
 
05:51:44.230 --> 05:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:44.240 --> 05:51:47.270 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:51:47.270 --> 05:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:53.708 --> 05:51:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:55.788 --> 05:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you for being
 
05:51:58.990 --> 05:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
here um when you mentioned the seven and
 
05:52:02.868 --> 05:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
30 and um the child is not there to
 
05:52:05.510 --> 05:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
educate um
 
05:52:09.510 --> 05:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
are are you referring to 70 being local
 
05:52:12.868 --> 05:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
funds versus 30% being State funds or
 
05:52:15.750 --> 05:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
how are you arrived at that split so I
 
05:52:18.390 --> 05:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
actually worked very hard um as a parent
 
05:52:20.190 --> 05:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
to advocate for Education Freedom
 
05:52:22.390 --> 05:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
accounts to begin with and the funding
 
05:52:24.070 --> 05:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
that they receive from the state level
 
05:52:26.788 --> 05:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
and the local level 100% of that goes
 
05:52:28.990 --> 05:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
into the education of the child is my
 
05:52:31.190 --> 05:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
understanding Now with an education
 
05:52:33.070 --> 05:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
Freedom account if that same child
 
05:52:36.030 --> 05:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
enters into an education Freedom account
 
05:52:39.590 --> 05:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
30% of that 100% is the only amount that
 
05:52:41.590 --> 05:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
goes with the child for the education
 
05:52:43.948 --> 05:52:43.958 align:start position:0%
Freedom account itself the other
 
05:52:46.670 --> 05:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
remaining 70% still stays within the
 
05:52:48.190 --> 05:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
within the budget that goes to the
 
05:52:51.830 --> 05:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
homeschool District or the District home
 
05:52:54.628 --> 05:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
where the school is where the child
 
05:52:57.628 --> 05:52:57.638 align:start position:0%
resides does that answer your question
 
05:52:57.638 --> 05:53:03.150 align:start position:0%
resides does that answer your question
okay

05:53:03.150 --> 05:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:27.150 --> 05:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:27.160 --> 05:53:29.390 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:53:29.390 --> 05:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:53:31.510 --> 05:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you all for having me
 
05:53:34.670 --> 05:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
and my children here today um we're here
 
05:53:39.110 --> 05:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
in opposition of this bill um we are
 
05:53:42.070 --> 05:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
participants in the EFA program and we
 
05:53:44.310 --> 05:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
were homeschoolers prior to this but my
 
05:53:46.910 --> 05:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
children were also in public school
 
05:53:49.430 --> 05:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
prior to that we had to remove them two
 
05:53:51.990 --> 05:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
of my children have Tourette Syndrome my
 
05:53:53.910 --> 05:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
oldest daughter who you'll hear from in
 
05:53:57.070 --> 05:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
a moment um was in a coma and has memory
 
05:53:58.990 --> 05:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
issues public public school just didn't
 
05:54:02.350 --> 05:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
work for her and the Tourette's really
 
05:54:04.510 --> 05:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
put a hindrance on my children's my
 
05:54:06.990 --> 05:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
other children's education in the public
 
05:54:09.070 --> 05:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
school system so we moved to
 
05:54:11.910 --> 05:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
homeschooling and the EFA money has
 
05:54:15.190 --> 05:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
given us the opportunity to get them
 
05:54:17.350 --> 05:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
working computers classes that we
 
05:54:19.910 --> 05:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have had access to um my
 
05:54:22.750 --> 05:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
husband and I are both disabled and so
 
05:54:25.350 --> 05:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
our income is very limited and so this
 
05:54:28.390 --> 05:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
money has been such a blessing to us us
 
05:54:31.390 --> 05:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to give our children the kind
 
05:54:34.390 --> 05:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
of education that they deserve and I
 
05:54:37.670 --> 05:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of talk about budgets and
 
05:54:39.390 --> 05:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
and money and things like that to the
 
05:54:42.548 --> 05:54:42.558 align:start position:0%
public schools but my children deserve
 
05:54:45.708 --> 05:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
just as much of a chance to have a
 
05:54:47.948 --> 05:54:47.958 align:start position:0%
quality education as children who are
 
05:54:49.430 --> 05:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
attending Public
 
05:54:54.110 --> 05:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
Schools um I'm sorry that I don't have
 
05:54:58.670 --> 05:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
numbers or impact reports to give to you
 
05:55:01.110 --> 05:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you that personally this
 
05:55:04.230 --> 05:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
bill would absolutely hurt my family
 
05:55:06.350 --> 05:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
firstly I don't even understand how we
 
05:55:09.150 --> 05:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
can talk about limiting to a budget of a
 
05:55:11.510 --> 05:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
hundred something thousand dollars when
 
05:55:13.430 --> 05:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
all of these other students have already
 
05:55:15.350 --> 05:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
gotten their dispersements I mean does
 
05:55:16.590 --> 05:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
that mean that I'm going to have to pay
 
05:55:17.948 --> 05:55:17.958 align:start position:0%
the money back that we've already used
 
05:55:19.788 --> 05:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
towards their education from the EA
 
05:55:21.868 --> 05:55:21.878 align:start position:0%
funds are they going to come after our
 
05:55:24.350 --> 05:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
tax money that we had already paid into
 
05:55:28.110 --> 05:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
this fund to repay it um I understand
 
05:55:30.910 --> 05:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
understand that we want to work with the
 
05:55:32.548 --> 05:55:32.558 align:start position:0%
public schools and I appreciate that
 
05:55:34.030 --> 05:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
they're there for the children that need
 
05:55:37.150 --> 05:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
them but this EFA fund is imperative to
 
05:55:39.628 --> 05:55:39.638 align:start position:0%
my children's education and continues to
 
05:55:43.110 --> 05:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
be imperative to all of the 1800 plus
 
05:55:46.270 --> 05:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
children who have chosen to take part of
 
05:55:49.548 --> 05:55:49.558 align:start position:0%
the AFA program because they are also
 
05:55:52.430 --> 05:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
searching for the right fit in their
 
05:55:54.990 --> 05:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
education choices and that is what the
 
05:55:56.910 --> 05:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
efas have allowed for
 
05:55:56.920 --> 05:56:08.310 align:start position:0%
efas have allowed for
us

05:56:08.310 --> 05:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:26.868 --> 05:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:26.878 --> 05:56:28.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:56:28.510 --> 05:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:56:28.520 --> 05:56:33.670 align:start position:0%
you
good

05:56:33.670 --> 05:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:35.590 --> 05:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon I believe that this bill
 
05:56:37.270 --> 05:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
should not be passed because I believe
 
05:56:38.910 --> 05:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
that everyone should be able to get the
 
05:56:40.788 --> 05:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
education that they need and should be
 
05:56:42.310 --> 05:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
provided with the things that they need
 
05:56:44.788 --> 05:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
to get the best education they can this
 
05:56:48.070 --> 05:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
bill will limit that and limiting that
 
05:56:51.190 --> 05:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
will affect many people that cannot
 
05:56:53.990 --> 05:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
afford public or private schools so I
 
05:56:56.788 --> 05:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
believe that this
 
05:56:56.798 --> 05:57:03.750 align:start position:0%
believe that this
bill

05:57:03.750 --> 05:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:05.430 --> 05:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
I believe that this bill should not get
 
05:57:07.670 --> 05:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
passed because it will affect several
 
05:57:10.468 --> 05:57:10.478 align:start position:0%
people that are that cannot afford
 
05:57:12.750 --> 05:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
public school or canot attend private
 
05:57:15.910 --> 05:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
school because of said disabilities or
 
05:57:17.788 --> 05:57:17.798 align:start position:0%
other problems that will prevent them
 
05:57:22.270 --> 05:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
from going to other schools so passing
 
05:57:25.430 --> 05:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
this bill will take so much from people
 
05:57:27.468 --> 05:57:27.478 align:start position:0%
who cannot go to public or private
 
05:57:31.190 --> 05:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
schools or can't afford to so passing
 
05:57:36.230 --> 05:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
this bill will take education away from
 
05:57:38.708 --> 05:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
so many children and I don't think that
 
05:57:41.830 --> 05:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
anybody wants their kid to not have an
 
05:57:43.788 --> 05:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
education I don't think anybody in this
 
05:57:46.628 --> 05:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
room would want that so I believe that
 
05:57:48.788 --> 05:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
this bill should not get passed so that
 
05:57:53.910 --> 05:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
we can all be educated and be able to
 
05:57:58.628 --> 05:57:58.638 align:start position:0%
have an education so that we can
 
05:58:03.670 --> 05:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
you know live so the money that we use
 
05:58:06.590 --> 05:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
for taxes is going to public schools and
 
05:58:08.030 --> 05:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
private schools which you also have to
 
05:58:11.868 --> 05:58:11.878 align:start position:0%
pay for just to get into so I don't
 
05:58:14.708 --> 05:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
understand why we should limit what we
 
05:58:17.628 --> 05:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
get and it's not going to affect the
 
05:58:19.750 --> 05:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
public or the private schools like
 
05:58:21.948 --> 05:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
intake because they're not limiting the
 
05:58:23.510 --> 05:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
money that the public and the private
 
05:58:26.310 --> 05:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
schools are taking in why should they
 
05:58:30.628 --> 05:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:34.310 --> 05:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:37.270 --> 05:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
speak I need money so I can get a new
 
05:58:39.270 --> 05:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
working computer for school please don't
 
05:58:41.468 --> 05:58:41.478 align:start position:0%
take my money
 
05:58:44.788 --> 05:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
away hang on one
 
05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:56.638 --> 05:59:26.788 align:start position:0%
 
1684

05:59:26.788 --> 05:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:26.798 --> 05:59:49.548 align:start position:0%
 
to

05:59:49.548 --> 05:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:52.310 --> 05:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
I'm shalomar inar I am the program and
 
05:59:53.750 --> 05:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
Outreach coordinator for the children's
 
05:59:53.760 --> 05:59:54.990 align:start position:0%
Outreach coordinator for the children's
scholarship

05:59:54.990 --> 05:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
05:59:57.670 --> 05:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
fund Matt Southerton director of policy
 
05:59:58.830 --> 05:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
in compliance for a children's
 
05:59:58.840 --> 06:00:01.350 align:start position:0%
in compliance for a children's
scholarship

06:00:01.350 --> 06:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:03.468 --> 06:00:03.478 align:start position:0%
fund uh I don't know if you just want me
 
06:00:06.510 --> 06:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
to jump into this I have a few issues to
 
06:00:08.548 --> 06:00:08.558 align:start position:0%
clear up that might uh help the
 
06:00:11.948 --> 06:00:11.958 align:start position:0%
committee uh so I think that the data
 
06:00:15.070 --> 06:00:15.080 align:start position:0%
that you were examining from earlier is
 
06:00:16.270 --> 06:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
a bit
 
06:00:18.948 --> 06:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
outdated the data that we have now shows
 
06:00:20.990 --> 06:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
approximately half of the students that
 
06:00:24.270 --> 06:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
are um participating in the EFA program
 
06:00:27.510 --> 06:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
are uh a former public school students
 
06:00:31.708 --> 06:00:31.718 align:start position:0%
students so that uh I think that the
 
06:00:33.590 --> 06:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
number used earlier was
 
06:00:36.948 --> 06:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
177% we have it a little under 50% you
 
06:00:39.190 --> 06:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
might uh check with the Department of
 
06:00:42.468 --> 06:00:42.478 align:start position:0%
Education to see if they can confirm
 
06:00:46.110 --> 06:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
that I think that uh we might want to
 
06:00:48.830 --> 06:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
examine the context when you speak about
 
06:00:52.788 --> 06:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
money um you know you're debating $8
 
06:00:55.430 --> 06:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
million and an education trust fund
 
06:00:59.788 --> 06:00:59.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:02.510 --> 06:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
another issue that when I examined this
 
06:01:04.750 --> 06:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
bill at first that sort of came to my
 
06:01:08.788 --> 06:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
mind was that this bill appears to be
 
06:01:11.270 --> 06:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
retroactive so we're wondering if this
 
06:01:14.868 --> 06:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass would this bill be
 
06:01:18.230 --> 06:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
defunding 1,00 students low-income
 
06:01:21.110 --> 06:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
families that currently receive the EFA
 
06:01:23.708 --> 06:01:23.718 align:start position:0%
so how would we go about collecting that
 
06:01:25.468 --> 06:01:25.478 align:start position:0%
money back from students that receed
 
06:01:28.070 --> 06:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
that funding because approximately 70%
 
06:01:31.150 --> 06:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:35.590 --> 06:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
awarded um it looks like in fiscal year
 
06:01:39.468 --> 06:01:39.478 align:start position:0%
22 you would limit the funding to three
 
06:01:39.478 --> 06:01:41.270 align:start position:0%
22 you would limit the funding to three
$3,300

06:01:41.270 --> 06:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
$3,300
 
06:01:44.030 --> 06:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
th000 so that would defund
 
06:01:47.270 --> 06:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
approximately 1152
 
06:01:51.510 --> 06:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
students so again how would we go about
 
06:01:53.190 --> 06:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
telling those
 
06:01:55.830 --> 06:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
students that they would no longer be
 
06:01:58.868 --> 06:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
eligible for those funds
 
06:02:01.070 --> 06:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
um in fiscal year
 
06:02:03.590 --> 06:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
22 it would defund
 
06:02:06.590 --> 06:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
1816 students again I don't know how we
 
06:02:09.350 --> 06:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
would go about collecting those
 
06:02:09.360 --> 06:02:11.990 align:start position:0%
would go about collecting those
funds

06:02:11.990 --> 06:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
funds
 
06:02:16.070 --> 06:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
um oh another point that we were not
 
06:02:17.230 --> 06:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure that the committee
 
06:02:19.670 --> 06:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
knows is that in order to be eligible
 
06:02:22.628 --> 06:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
for the EFA you have to be eligible to
 
06:02:25.468 --> 06:02:25.478 align:start position:0%
go to public school in New Hampshire so
 
06:02:26.990 --> 06:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
people were talking about you know
 
06:02:30.070 --> 06:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
you're your possible exposure
 
06:02:34.350 --> 06:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
to um you know costs in the future well
 
06:02:36.628 --> 06:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
you already have this exposure because
 
06:02:38.270 --> 06:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
the students that are eligible for the
 
06:02:40.350 --> 06:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
EFA are eligible to go to public school
 
06:02:42.070 --> 06:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
students right so I've worked with
 
06:02:44.628 --> 06:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
charter schools for 20 years and we see
 
06:02:46.150 --> 06:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
students going to the charter school
 
06:02:47.548 --> 06:02:47.558 align:start position:0%
going back to the traditional public
 
06:02:50.230 --> 06:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
school and back and forth so populations
 
06:02:52.910 --> 06:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
are somewhat transient you know we see
 
06:02:55.230 --> 06:02:55.240 align:start position:0%
them moving back and forth so I think
 
06:02:57.590 --> 06:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
that the the data that you have is is is
 
06:03:00.150 --> 06:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
very very preliminary data it's very
 
06:03:04.070 --> 06:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
very early for a a program that you know
 
06:03:05.150 --> 06:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
is really
 
06:03:07.708 --> 06:03:07.718 align:start position:0%
revolutionary and I don't think that
 
06:03:10.350 --> 06:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps we knew that the need was going
 
06:03:13.750 --> 06:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
to be so great and that that this this
 
06:03:15.390 --> 06:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
program would be able to launch so
 
06:03:17.830 --> 06:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
quickly and I am very thankful that it
 
06:03:20.150 --> 06:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
did because I know that last year I was
 
06:03:22.430 --> 06:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
receiving dozens and dozens of calls
 
06:03:25.070 --> 06:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
from parents in my office um really
 
06:03:28.030 --> 06:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
imploring for for um
 
06:03:29.510 --> 06:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know spaces for their students in
 
06:03:32.030 --> 06:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
charter schools and and I have family
 
06:03:33.750 --> 06:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
that teaches in traditional Public
 
06:03:35.070 --> 06:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
Schools so I'm a strong supporter as
 
06:03:36.910 --> 06:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
well so anyway I just wanted to clear up
 
06:03:40.628 --> 06:03:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:43.390 --> 06:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
shelar thank you good afternoon Mr chair
 
06:03:45.510 --> 06:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
and honorable members of the committee
 
06:03:47.788 --> 06:03:47.798 align:start position:0%
um before I I proceed with some of the
 
06:03:49.270 --> 06:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
information that I have here I do want
 
06:03:50.830 --> 06:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
to let you know I speak directly with
 
06:03:53.830 --> 06:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
the parents that have been um enrolled
 
06:03:55.910 --> 06:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the program I am I guess what you
 
06:03:58.190 --> 06:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
would call the boots on the ground I am
 
06:04:01.190 --> 06:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
face Toof face talking on the phone
 
06:04:02.990 --> 06:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
meeting with these parents and the
 
06:04:06.590 --> 06:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
students and so I see firsthand the need
 
06:04:09.390 --> 06:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
um for this program to exist we have so
 
06:04:11.548 --> 06:04:11.558 align:start position:0%
many families that have received well
 
06:04:14.708 --> 06:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
past the amount that this C proposes and
 
06:04:16.788 --> 06:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
these families have already used their
 
06:04:20.190 --> 06:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
EFA funds um and like Matt was saying if
 
06:04:22.670 --> 06:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
we have to go ahead and retroactive umly
 
06:04:24.670 --> 06:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
pay this back how would these families
 
06:04:26.670 --> 06:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
that are 300% below the poverty level
 
06:04:28.628 --> 06:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
expected to to pay this back that's kind
 
06:04:31.350 --> 06:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
of cruel to do that um families that
 
06:04:33.708 --> 06:04:33.718 align:start position:0%
need this program different types of
 
06:04:35.430 --> 06:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
kids that are behind grade love on
 
06:04:38.190 --> 06:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
struggling in their Public Schools um
 
06:04:39.868 --> 06:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
but they thrive in the smaller classroom
 
06:04:41.390 --> 06:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
at other schools whether it's a micro
 
06:04:44.430 --> 06:04:44.440 align:start position:0%
School a home school a private school um
 
06:04:46.150 --> 06:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
there are kids that and we all have to
 
06:04:48.070 --> 06:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
admit this come on everybody let's admit
 
06:04:50.708 --> 06:04:50.718 align:start position:0%
it in every school especially in the
 
06:04:52.350 --> 06:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
public school systems there are kids
 
06:04:54.190 --> 06:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
that are falling through the cracks and
 
06:04:55.910 --> 06:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're catching those kids and we're
 
06:04:58.270 --> 06:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
helping these kids because it's not fair
 
06:04:59.868 --> 06:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
that these children have to suffer and
 
06:05:01.830 --> 06:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
go throughout their lives feeling
 
06:05:03.510 --> 06:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
inadequate and feeling like they can't
 
06:05:05.750 --> 06:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're stupid they can't make it they
 
06:05:07.510 --> 06:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
can't do it because they're not getting
 
06:05:09.628 --> 06:05:09.638 align:start position:0%
the education that meets the needs that
 
06:05:12.910 --> 06:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
they have not the ones that is is is as
 
06:05:15.150 --> 06:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
a whole as a student that's saying okay
 
06:05:16.750 --> 06:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
every student is this
 
06:05:19.230 --> 06:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
way the kids whose's learning styles
 
06:05:21.350 --> 06:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
that make remote learning extremely
 
06:05:22.868 --> 06:05:22.878 align:start position:0%
difficult we know with the pandemic with
 
06:05:24.468 --> 06:05:24.478 align:start position:0%
everything that's been going on I think
 
06:05:26.270 --> 06:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest reasons why we got
 
06:05:27.948 --> 06:05:27.958 align:start position:0%
more parents in and more families than
 
06:05:29.910 --> 06:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
what we expected is a lot of these kids
 
06:05:31.708 --> 06:05:31.718 align:start position:0%
just don't weren't doing well with the
 
06:05:33.310 --> 06:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
remote learning I'm going to tell you a
 
06:05:35.670 --> 06:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
little secret I tried to do the online
 
06:05:38.310 --> 06:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
courses with college and I am horrible
 
06:05:40.190 --> 06:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
at it call me traditional or whatever
 
06:05:42.468 --> 06:05:42.478 align:start position:0%
but I need to be sited in a classroom
 
06:05:44.030 --> 06:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
and I do better when I have the teacher
 
06:05:46.310 --> 06:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
that can answer my questions so I can
 
06:05:48.270 --> 06:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
only imagine what it's like for these
 
06:05:50.070 --> 06:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
kids who just even though they're
 
06:05:51.430 --> 06:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
techsavvy it's like they're born
 
06:05:53.708 --> 06:05:53.718 align:start position:0%
nowadays knowing how to use a phone but
 
06:05:56.190 --> 06:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
still it's still difficult for them and
 
06:05:58.070 --> 06:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
expecting them to continue doing so if
 
06:06:00.548 --> 06:06:00.558 align:start position:0%
they're not thriving is not fair to the
 
06:06:03.788 --> 06:06:03.798 align:start position:0%
child either we also deal with kids um
 
06:06:05.070 --> 06:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
that we have kids that are experiencing
 
06:06:07.830 --> 06:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
racism and bullying um in their current
 
06:06:10.750 --> 06:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
schools at CSF we've seen many cases
 
06:06:12.548 --> 06:06:12.558 align:start position:0%
over the years about kids who have been
 
06:06:14.270 --> 06:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
bullied and discriminated against
 
06:06:16.948 --> 06:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
because of their skin color and we as an
 
06:06:18.948 --> 06:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
organization have been so fortunate to
 
06:06:20.430 --> 06:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
be able to bless these children and
 
06:06:22.270 --> 06:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
these families with the funds to be able
 
06:06:24.468 --> 06:06:24.478 align:start position:0%
to go to a school where they have
 
06:06:26.708 --> 06:06:26.718 align:start position:0%
blossomed however today I we have a
 
06:06:29.230 --> 06:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
story for you that happened recently and
 
06:06:31.510 --> 06:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
that has shaken us to the core at
 
06:06:35.190 --> 06:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
CSF the EFA program must be allowed to
 
06:06:37.948 --> 06:06:37.958 align:start position:0%
continue Kaden is a 12-year-old old
 
06:06:40.868 --> 06:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
child in seventh grade up until recently
 
06:06:42.868 --> 06:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
he was in a national public school stud
 
06:06:42.878 --> 06:06:43.750 align:start position:0%
he was in a national public school stud
uh

06:06:43.750 --> 06:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:06:46.468 --> 06:06:46.478 align:start position:0%
school he was assaulted by two other
 
06:06:49.190 --> 06:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
students while a third student took a
 
06:06:52.590 --> 06:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
video and uploaded it to Tik Tok which
 
06:06:54.868 --> 06:06:54.878 align:start position:0%
incidentally showed a teacher standing
 
06:06:58.110 --> 06:06:58.120 align:start position:0%
by not intervening Kaden was dragged to
 
06:07:00.590 --> 06:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
the ground and then his head was
 
06:07:02.990 --> 06:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
repeatedly stomped on by these other
 
06:07:05.430 --> 06:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
students and still no one
 
06:07:07.590 --> 06:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
intervened school authorities told the
 
06:07:09.150 --> 06:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
parents well the teachers are not
 
06:07:10.590 --> 06:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to intervene and are instructed
 
06:07:12.390 --> 06:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
to wait for the school resource officer
 
06:07:15.510 --> 06:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
to come and arrive and break up the
 
06:07:19.430 --> 06:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
assault how is this a
 
06:07:21.628 --> 06:07:21.638 align:start position:0%
thing had it not been for the existence
 
06:07:24.270 --> 06:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
of the EFA program Kaden's grandfather
 
06:07:25.990 --> 06:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
would have to had leave Kaden at the
 
06:07:28.670 --> 06:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
mercy of these bullies and a system that
 
06:07:31.788 --> 06:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
is unwilling to protect him so this
 
06:07:34.670 --> 06:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
program helps thousands of students and
 
06:07:37.270 --> 06:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
some are like Kaden who need emergency
 
06:07:41.030 --> 06:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
access to resources of the EFA program I
 
06:07:43.910 --> 06:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
ask that um you guys reconsider this
 
06:07:46.390 --> 06:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
bill and think about yes we have a
 
06:07:48.270 --> 06:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
bottom line there is money money's
 
06:07:49.628 --> 06:07:49.638 align:start position:0%
always going to what is is to say money
 
06:07:51.910 --> 06:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
makes the world go round but we also
 
06:07:54.510 --> 06:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
have kids and we need to think of their
 
06:07:56.548 --> 06:07:56.558 align:start position:0%
future not just in terms of public
 
06:07:59.350 --> 06:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
school in terms of Education as a whole
 
06:07:59.360 --> 06:08:12.590 align:start position:0%
school in terms of Education as a whole
thank

06:08:12.590 --> 06:08:12.600 align:start position:0%

received uh quite a few applications um
 
06:08:27.990 --> 06:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
did you receive applications that um you
 
06:08:31.750 --> 06:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
were not uh able to process because of
 
06:08:34.948 --> 06:08:34.958 align:start position:0%
Eligibility such as the income
 
06:08:38.670 --> 06:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
restrictions yes do you have an idea on
 
06:08:41.990 --> 06:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
numbers he's the numbers
 
06:08:44.750 --> 06:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
guy uh we did
 
06:08:47.390 --> 06:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
receive we did receive a number of
 
06:08:49.110 --> 06:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
applications that we were unable to
 
06:08:50.670 --> 06:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
process they did not meet those
 
06:08:55.708 --> 06:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:55.718 --> 06:09:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
100

06:09:02.070 --> 06:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:05.670 --> 06:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman L um sir let me go
 
06:09:08.270 --> 06:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
back to your your comment about the
 
06:09:11.628 --> 06:09:11.638 align:start position:0%
change in the uh number of
 
06:09:14.150 --> 06:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
50% uh compared to what we initially
 
06:09:15.788 --> 06:09:15.798 align:start position:0%
received on the information from the
 
06:09:18.548 --> 06:09:18.558 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh and my
 
06:09:21.310 --> 06:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
question is you indicated they were they
 
06:09:23.190 --> 06:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
had been previously enrolled in public
 
06:09:26.350 --> 06:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
school I think that's what you said that
 
06:09:29.510 --> 06:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:32.548 --> 06:09:32.558 align:start position:0%
number so that that
 
06:09:36.788 --> 06:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
number that number came from where
 
06:09:36.798 --> 06:09:39.030 align:start position:0%
number that number came from where
uh

06:09:39.030 --> 06:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:09:41.030 --> 06:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
hello I'm I'm might have a high time
 
06:09:44.310 --> 06:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
hearing you as well oh I'm sorry Jen uh
 
06:09:46.310 --> 06:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
did they explain to you what was wrong
 
06:09:49.910 --> 06:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
it look is it a loose connection up
 
06:09:52.390 --> 06:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
there yeah he did something in the back
 
06:09:55.628 --> 06:09:55.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:55.638 --> 06:10:12.230 align:start position:0%
 
one

06:10:12.230 --> 06:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:15.590 --> 06:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
all right so when a student no worries
 
06:10:17.510 --> 06:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
so when a student applies for the EFA
 
06:10:18.830 --> 06:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
they have to fill out a number of
 
06:10:22.230 --> 06:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
financial forms Etc one of those is have
 
06:10:25.230 --> 06:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
they attended a you know are they uh a
 
06:10:28.628 --> 06:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
currently a home school or a a public
 
06:10:30.868 --> 06:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
school student and and that all goes
 
06:10:33.548 --> 06:10:33.558 align:start position:0%
into the i4c system the Department of
 
06:10:35.910 --> 06:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
Education has all that data so that's
 
06:10:38.708 --> 06:10:38.718 align:start position:0%
that's how we uh you know we know where
 
06:10:41.070 --> 06:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
they're coming from and then we can load
 
06:10:44.150 --> 06:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
that up to the Department of
 
06:10:55.548 --> 06:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:55.558 --> 06:11:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
may

06:11:02.070 --> 06:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:03.708 --> 06:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely I don't have that with
 
06:11:05.190 --> 06:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
me right now but I can certainly get
 
06:11:13.670 --> 06:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:13.680 --> 06:11:17.230 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:11:17.230 --> 06:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:17.240 --> 06:11:24.670 align:start position:0%
 
right

06:11:24.670 --> 06:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:27.390 --> 06:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
yeah right right absolutely so I guess
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
and and and the department could give
 
06:11:31.468 --> 06:11:31.478 align:start position:0%
you exact numbers and and so could we I
 
06:11:41.150 --> 06:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:49.110 --> 06:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:49.120 --> 06:11:53.310 align:start position:0%
 
ahead

06:11:53.310 --> 06:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:55.468 --> 06:11:55.478 align:start position:0%
oh oh
 
06:11:55.478 --> 06:11:57.190 align:start position:0%
oh oh
absolutely

06:11:57.190 --> 06:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
06:12:00.230 --> 06:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely oh for sure absolutely
 
06:12:02.670 --> 06:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
and uh it is important to remember that
 
06:12:04.590 --> 06:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
uh the the students are coming and going
 
06:12:06.030 --> 06:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
all the time right so this is just a
 
06:12:14.990 --> 06:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:17.390 --> 06:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
right yeah absolutely we'll have K
 
06:12:20.830 --> 06:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:23.110 --> 06:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's further
 
06:12:25.830 --> 06:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing from the committee
 
06:12:28.310 --> 06:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:12:44.628 --> 06:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:46.788 --> 06:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no why don't you Brian why
 
06:12:48.230 --> 06:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
don't you go over and just bring a chair
 
06:12:53.230 --> 06:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
up and sit right speaking to the you can
 
06:12:54.628 --> 06:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
take one of those chairs right in front
 
06:12:58.390 --> 06:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:00.110 --> 06:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
yeah it was working was just staticky
 
06:13:00.120 --> 06:13:02.110 align:start position:0%
yeah it was working was just staticky
right

06:13:02.110 --> 06:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:13:04.270 --> 06:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
yeah all
 
06:13:07.110 --> 06:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
right uh thank you very much uh Mr
 
06:13:08.990 --> 06:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
chairman for the record Brian Hawkins
 
06:13:11.708 --> 06:13:11.718 align:start position:0%
represented Nea New Hampshire today um I
 
06:13:15.708 --> 06:13:15.718 align:start position:0%
think uh we're here uh we think the idea
 
06:13:20.270 --> 06:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
of HB 1684 to budget for this program uh
 
06:13:23.910 --> 06:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
which is a separate program um uh is a
 
06:13:25.670 --> 06:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
is a good idea during the budget process
 
06:13:28.468 --> 06:13:28.478 align:start position:0%
last year of the Senate um inserted the
 
06:13:30.990 --> 06:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
contents of Senate Bill 130 uh into the
 
06:13:33.990 --> 06:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
trailer bill of the budget um we think
 
06:13:36.110 --> 06:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
that this short changed the thorough
 
06:13:38.670 --> 06:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis that we assume the house
 
06:13:40.750 --> 06:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
would have done had they Advanced House
 
06:13:43.750 --> 06:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 20 last year uh which was a similar
 
06:13:46.270 --> 06:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
similar piece of legislation as you know
 
06:13:47.628 --> 06:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
uh and had it gone through the normal
 
06:13:51.150 --> 06:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
legislative process um as you know uh
 
06:13:54.310 --> 06:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
the house never did its own uh impact
 
06:13:57.910 --> 06:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
analysis of hb20 or Senate Bill 130 U
 
06:14:00.390 --> 06:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
because they were never fully voted on
 
06:14:03.150 --> 06:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
uh by the Full House as a standalone and
 
06:14:05.910 --> 06:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
so they were never sent to house finance
 
06:14:05.920 --> 06:14:06.750 align:start position:0%
so they were never sent to house finance
um

06:14:06.750 --> 06:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:09.750 --> 06:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh the lack of dedicated
 
06:14:11.948 --> 06:14:11.958 align:start position:0%
time in a finance committee left the
 
06:14:14.390 --> 06:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
department of education's estimates on
 
06:14:16.750 --> 06:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
participation rate and cost without the
 
06:14:18.628 --> 06:14:18.638 align:start position:0%
added scrutiny of the legislative budget
 
06:14:21.350 --> 06:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
Assistance office um as had been done a
 
06:14:24.750 --> 06:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
few years ago with Senate Bill 193 uh
 
06:14:25.948 --> 06:14:25.958 align:start position:0%
which the legislature ultimately
 
06:14:30.350 --> 06:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
rejected Ed um there were uh amendments
 
06:14:32.708 --> 06:14:32.718 align:start position:0%
to that bill that explored different
 
06:14:37.350 --> 06:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
types of caps uh uh to that to that
 
06:14:38.230 --> 06:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
piece of
 
06:14:41.590 --> 06:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
legislation um today uh this is a much
 
06:14:43.990 --> 06:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
more expansive law than than that bill
 
06:14:47.590 --> 06:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
was uh and we have a snapshot now of the
 
06:14:51.548 --> 06:14:51.558 align:start position:0%
uh estimates versus the reality
 
06:14:53.788 --> 06:14:53.798 align:start position:0%
um and you know we're seeing now that
 
06:14:56.948 --> 06:14:56.958 align:start position:0%
there's a you know basically this 6200
 
06:15:00.350 --> 06:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
per over or underestimate of the first
 
06:15:04.510 --> 06:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
year of the program um and uh I I won't
 
06:15:05.990 --> 06:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
go through all the same statistics I
 
06:15:07.788 --> 06:15:07.798 align:start position:0%
think representative luno represented
 
06:15:10.910 --> 06:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
those um before but next year's estimate
 
06:15:15.990 --> 06:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
is 3.3 million um I think why that is uh
 
06:15:18.390 --> 06:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
particularly important is because these
 
06:15:20.708 --> 06:15:20.718 align:start position:0%
are the numbers that are carried on
 
06:15:24.190 --> 06:15:24.200 align:start position:0%
the um on the balance sheet for the
 
06:15:27.150 --> 06:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
State uh this is what the state assumes
 
06:15:29.788 --> 06:15:29.798 align:start position:0%
when it uh assumes a BAL Surplus
 
06:15:32.510 --> 06:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
statement um when it assumes that it has
 
06:15:35.948 --> 06:15:35.958 align:start position:0%
passed a balanced budget so it's I think
 
06:15:37.708 --> 06:15:37.718 align:start position:0%
it's important
 
06:15:39.948 --> 06:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
process-wise that the legislature take a
 
06:15:42.150 --> 06:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
look at budgeting this program going
 
06:15:47.030 --> 06:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
forward um and uh so that that is a
 
06:15:48.990 --> 06:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
concept we're we're very supportive of
 
06:15:50.750 --> 06:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
in other states where they have a
 
06:15:56.190 --> 06:15:56.200 align:start position:0%
program like this um it has started uh
 
06:15:58.708 --> 06:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
those numbers have expanded quite a bit
 
06:16:01.390 --> 06:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
but those expansions have largely come
 
06:16:04.270 --> 06:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
because the legislature in those states
 
06:16:06.390 --> 06:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
have ex has expanded the
 
06:16:08.990 --> 06:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility um in New Hampshire we
 
06:16:11.110 --> 06:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
started out with a very expansive
 
06:16:13.910 --> 06:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria um as was stated
 
06:16:15.788 --> 06:16:15.798 align:start position:0%
earlier you just have to be a student
 
06:16:19.030 --> 06:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
who is eligible to be a K12 student in
 
06:16:21.990 --> 06:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that's a very uh expansive
 
06:16:25.468 --> 06:16:25.478 align:start position:0%
uh uh group of students so um so
 
06:16:27.788 --> 06:16:27.798 align:start position:0%
starting out like that and especially if
 
06:16:30.270 --> 06:16:30.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature is considering expanding
 
06:16:30.280 --> 06:16:31.150 align:start position:0%
the legislature is considering expanding
the

06:16:31.150 --> 06:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:16:34.270 --> 06:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility um as was I think mentioned
 
06:16:36.750 --> 06:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
or alluded to earlier having those
 
06:16:39.468 --> 06:16:39.478 align:start position:0%
budgeted amounts so you know what it is
 
06:16:41.350 --> 06:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
the state is looking at going forward
 
06:16:43.590 --> 06:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
would is important so I'll close my
 
06:16:45.830 --> 06:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
testimony there and uh happy to take any
 
06:16:48.110 --> 06:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much Mr Hawkins
 
06:16:49.750 --> 06:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
06:16:52.670 --> 06:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
for for the
 
06:16:55.070 --> 06:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
presenter not seeing any questions oh
 
06:17:11.110 --> 06:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:13.230 --> 06:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
um well I think there are a number of
 
06:17:15.548 --> 06:17:15.558 align:start position:0%
programs in the state that have that
 
06:17:18.230 --> 06:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
require an appropriation and so and I
 
06:17:20.110 --> 06:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
think that I think the question needs to
 
06:17:21.590 --> 06:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
be looked at and I think this is why
 
06:17:23.190 --> 06:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's important to go through the the
 
06:17:26.750 --> 06:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
full budgeting process with this is well
 
06:17:29.270 --> 06:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know where where did those estimates
 
06:17:33.708 --> 06:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
a on determining what is uh an
 
06:17:36.830 --> 06:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount uh fortunately um the
 
06:17:39.750 --> 06:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
legislature has different tools at its
 
06:17:43.430 --> 06:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
disposal if there's a program needed uh
 
06:17:45.150 --> 06:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
if there's more funding needed for a
 
06:17:47.548 --> 06:17:47.558 align:start position:0%
particular program there are options
 
06:17:50.390 --> 06:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
that that that the executive department
 
06:17:52.948 --> 06:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
has to go before the fiscal committee or
 
06:17:55.070 --> 06:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
some other type of committee to make an
 
06:17:56.708 --> 06:17:56.718 align:start position:0%
argument why there need to be further
 
06:17:59.590 --> 06:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
funding so I think I think it goes to
 
06:18:02.468 --> 06:18:02.478 align:start position:0%
the and sometimes those are approved
 
06:18:04.468 --> 06:18:04.478 align:start position:0%
sometimes those are not approved but it
 
06:18:06.270 --> 06:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
it it forces I think the executive
 
06:18:10.070 --> 06:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
branch to hold to hold to its amounts
 
06:18:13.190 --> 06:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
and justify if need be you know why
 
06:18:16.310 --> 06:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
those need to be exceeded so thank you
 
06:18:21.708 --> 06:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:24.910 --> 06:18:24.920 align:start position:0%

and uh and before um bill and I sort of
 
06:26:33.990 --> 06:26:34.000 align:start position:0%

the second Bill we have heard that we
 
06:26:52.110 --> 06:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
are going to be setting up a
 
06:26:54.628 --> 06:26:54.638 align:start position:0%
subcommittee a work session I've
 
06:26:56.788 --> 06:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
announced earlier today the members
 
06:26:58.628 --> 06:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
which will be on the subcommittee for
 
06:27:01.150 --> 06:27:01.160 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill and that

subcommittee will meet its first time on
 
06:27:06.468 --> 06:27:06.478 align:start position:0%
January the
 
06:27:10.510 --> 06:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
24th and I believe that one is in the 10
 
06:27:12.830 --> 06:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
a.m. 10 amm and then we have the other
 
06:27:15.548 --> 06:27:15.558 align:start position:0%
committee meeting which is dealing with
 
06:27:18.468 --> 06:27:18.478 align:start position:0%
tuition or or excuse me degrees offered
 
06:27:20.590 --> 06:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
at the community college level that will
 
06:27:22.990 --> 06:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
be at uh 1:00 in the afternoon on the
 
06:27:25.510 --> 06:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
24th so we have a two-hour session set
 
06:27:29.788 --> 06:27:29.798 align:start position:0%
there I'm sure due to the the uh amount
 
06:27:32.350 --> 06:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
of information and data and data points
 
06:27:33.590 --> 06:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to look at in terms
 
06:27:36.750 --> 06:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
of this bill along with policy uh it's
 
06:27:38.990 --> 06:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
going to take more than one meeting of a
 
06:27:40.788 --> 06:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session what we will
 
06:27:43.230 --> 06:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
do then is invite those with technical
 
06:27:46.708 --> 06:27:46.718 align:start position:0%
support and those who want to listen and
 
06:27:48.628 --> 06:27:48.638 align:start position:0%
and observe you're welcome to come to
 
06:27:50.948 --> 06:27:50.958 align:start position:0%
the sub committee meeting uh then it
 
06:27:53.070 --> 06:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
will be brought back from uh the
 
06:27:55.990 --> 06:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for recommendation uh at an
 
06:27:58.788 --> 06:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
executive meeting to when we do uh
 
06:28:01.708 --> 06:28:01.718 align:start position:0%
dispense with 1680 so that in the
 
06:28:03.830 --> 06:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
nutshell is where we're going I think
 
06:28:05.628 --> 06:28:05.638 align:start position:0%
it's the best way to address something
 
06:28:08.390 --> 06:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's so comprehensive and and got so
 
06:28:10.628 --> 06:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
much longlasting
 
06:28:14.830 --> 06:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh need in this state and um so I look
 
06:28:17.948 --> 06:28:17.958 align:start position:0%
forward I myself uh have not had an
 
06:28:19.350 --> 06:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get down the nuts and
 
06:28:22.150 --> 06:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
bolts of this I hope that we can get the
 
06:28:26.708 --> 06:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
the 30,000 view right now and uh and
 
06:28:28.750 --> 06:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
then later on during the subcommittee
 
06:28:31.468 --> 06:28:31.478 align:start position:0%
get down into the weeds that's excellent
 
06:28:33.670 --> 06:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you very much for that I
 
06:28:36.510 --> 06:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
think that's a that's a a great way to
 
06:28:39.510 --> 06:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
do this and that's um that's bill and my
 
06:28:43.590 --> 06:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
my intention this afternoon to um uh to
 
06:28:45.910 --> 06:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
introduce this uh talk about it at the
 
06:28:48.830 --> 06:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
30,000 foot level we did pass out a
 
06:28:52.190 --> 06:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
couple handouts um uh after I uh begin
 
06:28:55.110 --> 06:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
the introduction uh Bill's going to walk
 
06:28:58.868 --> 06:28:58.878 align:start position:0%
us through the this document right here
 
06:29:01.788 --> 06:29:01.798 align:start position:0%
uh which um which cruises us through the
 
06:29:06.350 --> 06:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
30 ,000 foot view of the bill um I also
 
06:29:09.070 --> 06:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
uh we also handed out a a section by
 
06:29:11.830 --> 06:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
section summary of the bill we do not
 
06:29:14.390 --> 06:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
have intention to go through this today
 
06:29:16.868 --> 06:29:16.878 align:start position:0%
but um uh but we we I think this would
 
06:29:18.430 --> 06:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
probably be one of the first things we
 
06:29:21.628 --> 06:29:21.638 align:start position:0%
tee up uh once we get into uh the work
 
06:29:23.788 --> 06:29:23.798 align:start position:0%
sessions but uh but we thought we'd hand
 
06:29:26.230 --> 06:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
it out today for everybody body's um

introduction um so um just want to take
 
06:32:08.750 --> 06:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
a few minutes to uh to uh set the
 
06:32:10.910 --> 06:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
backdrop here and talk about some of the
 
06:32:12.990 --> 06:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
recent work and challenges that uh that
 
06:32:15.190 --> 06:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
have faced this legislature when it
 
06:32:16.948 --> 06:32:16.958 align:start position:0%
comes to how New Hampshire funds its
 
06:32:20.708 --> 06:32:20.718 align:start position:0%
schools but but starting at the top uh I
 
06:32:22.510 --> 06:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
think we all know you've heard me say it
 
06:32:24.310 --> 06:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
countless times but we've all read it
 
06:32:26.670 --> 06:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
too New Hampshire students perform among
 
06:32:28.110 --> 06:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
the best in the
 
06:32:30.830 --> 06:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
country you know on average in New
 
06:32:33.468 --> 06:32:33.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're like top four top five
 
06:32:37.590 --> 06:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
top six uh as a state uh in terms of in
 
06:32:42.430 --> 06:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
terms of of uh student performance um uh
 
06:32:46.590 --> 06:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
but um but unfortunately the way we fund
 
06:32:50.510 --> 06:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
our schools is um is not fair for our
 
06:32:54.070 --> 06:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
students or for taxpayers and um and as
 
06:32:56.670 --> 06:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
a result of that
 
06:33:00.070 --> 06:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
um while we're good on average as a
 
06:33:02.948 --> 06:33:02.958 align:start position:0%
state it's just not happening everywhere
 
06:33:05.150 --> 06:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
and um and one of the things that we
 
06:33:08.070 --> 06:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
looked at um about a year and a half ago
 
06:33:10.670 --> 06:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
during the commission's work was uh was
 
06:33:12.948 --> 06:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
10 years of data collected by the
 
06:33:16.788 --> 06:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and um all sorts
 
06:33:18.948 --> 06:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
of data but but particularly student
 
06:33:22.230 --> 06:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
student outcome data and uh uh one of
 
06:33:24.150 --> 06:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
the real eye openening I I think this
 
06:33:25.830 --> 06:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
was one of of the real eye openening
 
06:33:29.388 --> 06:33:29.398 align:start position:0%
findings that uh that that data varies
 
06:33:33.270 --> 06:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
widely and um uh while our average
 
06:33:35.468 --> 06:33:35.478 align:start position:0%
student performance Statewide is very
 
06:33:37.868 --> 06:33:37.878 align:start position:0%
strong the average student performance
 
06:33:37.878 --> 06:33:39.030 align:start position:0%
strong the average student performance
in

06:33:39.030 --> 06:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:33:41.750 --> 06:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester and this isn't this isn't a
 
06:33:44.830 --> 06:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
shot against Manchester's teachers or
 
06:33:47.230 --> 06:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
their administrators or the
 
06:33:50.310 --> 06:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
representatives um uh uh it's it's a
 
06:33:51.750 --> 06:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
shot at how New Hampshire funds the
 
06:33:53.230 --> 06:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
schools but the average student in
 
06:33:55.830 --> 06:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester perform per at the fifth
 
06:33:58.708 --> 06:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
percentile that means 95 out of every
 
06:34:00.868 --> 06:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
hundred students in New Hampshire
 
06:34:04.468 --> 06:34:04.478 align:start position:0%
performs better than the average student
 
06:34:04.478 --> 06:34:05.230 align:start position:0%
performs better than the average student
in

06:34:05.230 --> 06:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:34:09.110 --> 06:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester at the same time you head out
 
06:34:12.430 --> 06:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh towards the Sea Coast things change
 
06:34:14.510 --> 06:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
dramatically the average student in
 
06:34:19.430 --> 06:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:21.948 --> 06:34:21.958 align:start position:0%
percentile fifth percentile and 90th
 
06:34:24.030 --> 06:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
percentile and a lot of this is as a
 
06:34:27.110 --> 06:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
direct result of of how we fund our
 
06:34:30.150 --> 06:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
schools local property tax rates vary
 
06:34:33.310 --> 06:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
widely too uh from in some places less
 
06:34:37.670 --> 06:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
than $3 per thousand um and uh to uh to
 
06:34:42.070 --> 06:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
over $20 per thousand and um you know
 
06:34:44.150 --> 06:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
while while some uh
 
06:34:46.628 --> 06:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
districts uh for example the one that I
 
06:34:49.670 --> 06:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
live in hopkington uh work super super
 
06:34:53.388 --> 06:34:53.398 align:start position:0%
hard uh spend close to $20 per thousand
 
06:34:56.628 --> 06:34:56.638 align:start position:0%
uh and we just barely can uh can afford
 
06:34:58.750 --> 06:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
a satisfactory school budget we do have
 
06:35:02.868 --> 06:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
a a fairly High performing um uh outcome
 
06:35:04.670 --> 06:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
there's other districts that are working
 
06:35:06.590 --> 06:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
a lot harder than we
 
06:35:09.510 --> 06:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
are a district that might be 15 20
 
06:35:12.628 --> 06:35:12.638 align:start position:0%
minutes up the road and uh and uh
 
06:35:15.110 --> 06:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
working harder than $20 per thousand and
 
06:35:17.230 --> 06:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
still come up well short of what they
 
06:35:19.548 --> 06:35:19.558 align:start position:0%
need to uh to provide an adequate
 
06:35:22.948 --> 06:35:22.958 align:start position:0%
education for um for their schools um
 
06:35:24.070 --> 06:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's not because they don't want to
 
06:35:25.430 --> 06:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
they're work working super hard to try
 
06:35:27.430 --> 06:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
to do that they just can't get there
 
06:35:29.310 --> 06:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
with the property valuations that they
 
06:35:33.868 --> 06:35:33.878 align:start position:0%
have so that sort of brings us to to
 
06:35:36.830 --> 06:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
recent work in this in this area I think
 
06:35:40.150 --> 06:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of people remember five years ago
 
06:35:42.270 --> 06:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
uh I think it was about five years ago
 
06:35:44.670 --> 06:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
um there was an effort to uh to phase
 
06:35:47.788 --> 06:35:47.798 align:start position:0%
out stabilization grants and where it
 
06:35:51.230 --> 06:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
would be chipped away reduced at a at a
 
06:35:54.990 --> 06:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
4% a year over 25 years and uh that
 
06:35:58.388 --> 06:35:58.398 align:start position:0%
backfired pretty quickly um because uh
 
06:36:00.110 --> 06:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
because these stabilization grants which
 
06:36:02.948 --> 06:36:02.958 align:start position:0%
were put into the formula uh in in I
 
06:36:02.958 --> 06:36:03.670 align:start position:0%
were put into the formula uh in in I
think

06:36:03.670 --> 06:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:36:06.750 --> 06:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
2011 uh really were there to shore up a
 
06:36:09.150 --> 06:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
formula that didn't meet the needs of uh
 
06:36:13.990 --> 06:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
of many of our um uh uh most um um
 
06:36:17.230 --> 06:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
vulnerable districts and uh and so so I
 
06:36:19.350 --> 06:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
think mayor Grenier probably wore out a
 
06:36:21.190 --> 06:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
couple sets of tires you probably
 
06:36:24.350 --> 06:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
remember this driving down to lob 207
 
06:36:26.430 --> 06:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
talking about what Berlin was facing and
 
06:36:28.388 --> 06:36:28.398 align:start position:0%
the challenges that they were facing
 
06:36:30.150 --> 06:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
with uh with stabilization being shipped
 
06:36:32.070 --> 06:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
away so so that got rectified and
 
06:36:34.628 --> 06:36:34.638 align:start position:0%
stabilization got put back in at
 
06:36:38.548 --> 06:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
100% um three years ago um uh chairman
 
06:36:41.548 --> 06:36:41.558 align:start position:0%
lad and I uh worked together uh on House
 
06:36:45.548 --> 06:36:45.558 align:start position:0%
Bill 709 and uh and uh we introduced a
 
06:36:47.628 --> 06:36:47.638 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity Aid which had
 
06:36:50.910 --> 06:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
been long ago in a uh into funding
 
06:36:53.468 --> 06:36:53.478 align:start position:0%
formula and uh an enhanced Aid to
 
06:36:56.030 --> 06:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
districts with higher concentrations of
 
06:37:00.548 --> 06:37:00.558 align:start position:0%
um of lower income families um all these
 
06:37:02.830 --> 06:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
Provisions made their way into the uh
 
06:37:07.310 --> 06:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
the fy20 fy21 budget on a one-time basis
 
06:37:11.030 --> 06:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
and the uh the uh uh the state um uh
 
06:37:13.868 --> 06:37:13.878 align:start position:0%
actually at at for at the time had the
 
06:37:18.070 --> 06:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
largest single year uh in uh increase in
 
06:37:22.468 --> 06:37:22.478 align:start position:0%
um in U um uh contributions from the
 
06:37:24.990 --> 06:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund 625
 
06:37:28.628 --> 06:37:28.638 align:start position:0%
million and then last year um House Bill
 
06:37:33.708 --> 06:37:33.718 align:start position:0%
608 sponsored by uh by chairman lad um
 
06:37:35.910 --> 06:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
sought to uh to also work within the
 
06:37:37.948 --> 06:37:37.958 align:start position:0%
current framework of uh of school
 
06:37:39.788 --> 06:37:39.798 align:start position:0%
funding and it ran into a lot of
 
06:37:41.628 --> 06:37:41.638 align:start position:0%
challenges I mean Rick you and I talked
 
06:37:44.990 --> 06:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
about that that bill quite a bit and uh
 
06:37:48.948 --> 06:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
and uh removing stabilization uh posed a
 
06:37:52.430 --> 06:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
lot of uh a lot of problems given the uh
 
06:37:54.388 --> 06:37:54.398 align:start position:0%
given the current um you know fing
 
06:37:56.150 --> 06:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
framework that that we see and then
 
06:37:58.468 --> 06:37:58.478 align:start position:0%
there were additional bills Senate Bill
 
06:38:00.468 --> 06:38:00.478 align:start position:0%
135 130
 
06:38:04.388 --> 06:38:04.398 align:start position:0%
158 uh and even House Bill too that um
 
06:38:06.910 --> 06:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
that uh put put actually considerable
 
06:38:09.830 --> 06:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
State dollars into into the education
 
06:38:13.990 --> 06:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
trust fund $685 million and um and at a
 
06:38:16.830 --> 06:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
at a new record and uh for um for
 
06:38:20.310 --> 06:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
support for public schools and FY 23 but
 
06:38:23.110 --> 06:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
the problem is the framework doesn't
 
06:38:28.868 --> 06:38:28.878 align:start position:0%
work um uh and um and what uh what we
 
06:38:31.750 --> 06:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
found um during uh during during
 
06:38:36.030 --> 06:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
commission work um is that um is that is
 
06:38:39.230 --> 06:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has very much a a
 
06:38:43.030 --> 06:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
flat costing and a flat funding model
 
06:38:46.388 --> 06:38:46.398 align:start position:0%
that fails to take into consideration
 
06:38:49.468 --> 06:38:49.478 align:start position:0%
the um the the the characteristics and
 
06:38:51.868 --> 06:38:51.878 align:start position:0%
needs that our school districts across
 
06:38:56.070 --> 06:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
the state have and we can take two very
 
06:38:57.468 --> 06:38:57.478 align:start position:0%
two districts that are very close
 
06:39:00.788 --> 06:39:00.798 align:start position:0%
together Benford and Manchester it costs
 
06:39:03.190 --> 06:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
more to educate a thousand kids in
 
06:39:05.190 --> 06:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester than it does a thousand kids
 
06:39:05.200 --> 06:39:06.590 align:start position:0%
Manchester than it does a thousand kids
in

06:39:06.590 --> 06:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:39:09.190 --> 06:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
Bedford but New Hampshire school funding
 
06:39:12.868 --> 06:39:12.878 align:start position:0%
formula doesn't recognize that and U and
 
06:39:15.270 --> 06:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't recognize that from a costing
 
06:39:18.430 --> 06:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
perspective or a funding perspective
 
06:39:20.430 --> 06:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire pushes both these
 
06:39:23.110 --> 06:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
two things together you cost it on a
 
06:39:25.708 --> 06:39:25.718 align:start position:0%
flat basis and then everybody gets the
 
06:39:28.548 --> 06:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
funding from the State against that cost
 
06:39:30.548 --> 06:39:30.558 align:start position:0%
whether you're Manchester or
 
06:39:33.670 --> 06:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
Bedford um so
 
06:39:36.990 --> 06:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
um what uh what we're here to talk about
 
06:39:40.708 --> 06:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
today is a is a new way to look at um at
 
06:39:42.468 --> 06:39:42.478 align:start position:0%
school funding and it's new for New
 
06:39:45.110 --> 06:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's not new um nationally
 
06:39:48.190 --> 06:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
other other states notably Massachusetts
 
06:39:51.548 --> 06:39:51.558 align:start position:0%
are um are on their on their way to um
 
06:39:54.110 --> 06:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh to a funding model similar to this
 
06:39:55.350 --> 06:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
but it's called the foundation
 
06:40:00.070 --> 06:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity program and it um it uh uh
 
06:40:03.110 --> 06:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
it does two things very very well it
 
06:40:07.388 --> 06:40:07.398 align:start position:0%
recognizes the cost differences that um
 
06:40:10.548 --> 06:40:10.558 align:start position:0%
that that each district has given their
 
06:40:11.868 --> 06:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
given the characteristics of the
 
06:40:13.628 --> 06:40:13.638 align:start position:0%
students and the and the district and
 
06:40:16.628 --> 06:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
the communities they serve um but it
 
06:40:19.150 --> 06:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
also applies the state's limited
 
06:40:22.510 --> 06:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
resources to where they're needed most
 
06:40:26.310 --> 06:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
and um uh and and uh
 
06:40:29.468 --> 06:40:29.478 align:start position:0%
uh and that helps to write the ship that
 
06:40:33.510 --> 06:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
helps to improve fairness for both
 
06:40:36.150 --> 06:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
students in terms of student outcomes
 
06:40:39.670 --> 06:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
and taxpayers in terms of um in terms of
 
06:40:44.030 --> 06:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh tax affordability so we're um we're
 
06:40:47.750 --> 06:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
looking to uh again run through the um
 
06:40:51.150 --> 06:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
uh the foundation opportunity program uh
 
06:40:54.830 --> 06:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
at a fairly high level um where uh we're
 
06:40:57.230 --> 06:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
very excited that uh that this committee
 
06:41:00.270 --> 06:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
has decided to uh to bring this into uh
 
06:41:04.070 --> 06:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
work sessions beginning on the 24th and
 
06:41:07.030 --> 06:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
um and I'd like to hand it over to uh to
 
06:41:10.910 --> 06:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
my my good friend Bill ardinger to uh to
 
06:41:12.948 --> 06:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
take us through uh what the foundation
 
06:41:15.350 --> 06:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity program is all
 
06:41:17.548 --> 06:41:17.558 align:start position:0%
about and we will be happy to take
 
06:41:20.388 --> 06:41:20.398 align:start position:0%
questions together and and again thank
 
06:41:22.510 --> 06:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman for this opportunity to
 
06:41:24.510 --> 06:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill and then consider it
 
06:41:27.310 --> 06:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
more carefully in a study committee I
 
06:41:30.150 --> 06:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
will try to leave my remarks brief and
 
06:41:32.150 --> 06:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
not get too much into the weeds provide
 
06:41:33.548 --> 06:41:33.558 align:start position:0%
that that'll be tough for you won't it
 
06:41:35.628 --> 06:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
Bill yes it's it's been hard for me all
 
06:41:39.708 --> 06:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
my life so uh I'll start with a simple
 
06:41:43.388 --> 06:41:43.398 align:start position:0%
uh thing that the commission focused on
 
06:41:45.948 --> 06:41:45.958 align:start position:0%
the commission looked at New Hampshire
 
06:41:49.150 --> 06:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
among the highest outcomes of public
 
06:41:53.430 --> 06:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
schools in the nation on average among
 
06:41:56.468 --> 06:41:56.478 align:start position:0%
the highest spending per
 
06:42:00.788 --> 06:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
pupil in the nation on average however
 
06:42:03.110 --> 06:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
when you take that lens with the help of
 
06:42:06.270 --> 06:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
an expert and look around the state what
 
06:42:10.070 --> 06:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
you see is that there are opportunity
 
06:42:13.030 --> 06:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
gaps I went to school in Claremont when
 
06:42:17.468 --> 06:42:17.478 align:start position:0%
we had very good businesses there they
 
06:42:20.270 --> 06:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
closed after my wife and I my met my
 
06:42:22.070 --> 06:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
wife in high school after we had
 
06:42:25.310 --> 06:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
graduated and moved on the quality
 
06:42:27.270 --> 06:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
available of public education in new
 
06:42:30.750 --> 06:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
Hamp in Claremont fell what this study
 
06:42:33.788 --> 06:42:33.798 align:start position:0%
clearly identified with data on outcomes
 
06:42:36.708 --> 06:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
that wasn't available 20 years ago is
 
06:42:38.670 --> 06:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
that there's a gap between the
 
06:42:41.830 --> 06:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a quality traditional
 
06:42:44.430 --> 06:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
public education in Claremont and other
 
06:42:47.948 --> 06:42:47.958 align:start position:0%
communities compared to other places
 
06:42:51.030 --> 06:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
like say Hanover and other communities
 
06:42:54.310 --> 06:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
it is that opportunity Gap
 
06:42:59.270 --> 06:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
that this complicated Bill focuses on
 
06:43:01.788 --> 06:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
and takes the precious state budget
 
06:43:05.270 --> 06:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
dollars that are currently in the budget
 
06:43:07.310 --> 06:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
in the first year in the Surplus
 
06:43:11.830 --> 06:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
statement and Rea portions those dollars
 
06:43:14.590 --> 06:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
to try to give those school districts
 
06:43:18.388 --> 06:43:18.398 align:start position:0%
what they need to close the opportunity
 
06:43:21.830 --> 06:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
Gap and help the students who are
 
06:43:25.110 --> 06:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
attending public schools there remember
 
06:43:28.468 --> 06:43:28.478 align:start position:0%
our traditional common Public Schools
 
06:43:30.430 --> 06:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
like the one my wife and I went to at
 
06:43:33.990 --> 06:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
Stevens and Claremont educate over
 
06:43:37.468 --> 06:43:37.478 align:start position:0%
95% of New Hampshire's children that's
 
06:43:40.910 --> 06:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
the way we help children have access to
 
06:43:44.868 --> 06:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
good happy lives but we know now based
 
06:43:46.910 --> 06:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
on the work of the commission and the
 
06:43:48.830 --> 06:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
expert analysis that we receive by
 
06:43:50.670 --> 06:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
hiring a national expert that
 
06:43:53.990 --> 06:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity gaps exist we've all known
 
06:43:55.948 --> 06:43:55.958 align:start position:0%
this as people who care about New
 
06:43:58.230 --> 06:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in our hearts we know there's
 
06:44:00.190 --> 06:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
a difference between the public
 
06:44:03.510 --> 06:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
education available in one place and
 
06:44:07.430 --> 06:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
that available and say Claremont our job
 
06:44:09.190 --> 06:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
and we had a wonderful who's a member of
 
06:44:11.788 --> 06:44:11.798 align:start position:0%
this committee who's not here uh Mel
 
06:44:14.190 --> 06:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
Meer representative Mel Miler who I had
 
06:44:15.788 --> 06:44:15.798 align:start position:0%
never worked with before I was on this
 
06:44:18.190 --> 06:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
commission and I've come to have great
 
06:44:21.510 --> 06:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
faith in his heart and what he said is
 
06:44:23.270 --> 06:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
even though and my wife and I we move
 
06:44:26.030 --> 06:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
back we lived in conquer we raised our
 
06:44:28.708 --> 06:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
three children in conquer my wife served
 
06:44:30.670 --> 06:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
as uh president of the conquered school
 
06:44:33.030 --> 06:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
board for 10 years and then she worked
 
06:44:35.830 --> 06:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
on naming one of our K through five
 
06:44:38.350 --> 06:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
schools Christa mlli school I see that
 
06:44:41.030 --> 06:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
picture we all care about public schools
 
06:44:44.230 --> 06:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
many of us have gone through them uh
 
06:44:47.868 --> 06:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
what I find is that I can't sit there
 
06:44:50.468 --> 06:44:50.478 align:start position:0%
even though conquer has a particular
 
06:44:53.030 --> 06:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
quality of good Public Schools I can't
 
06:44:55.310 --> 06:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
sit there knowing There's an opportunity
 
06:44:58.910 --> 06:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
Gap in Claremont and representative
 
06:45:02.548 --> 06:45:02.558 align:start position:0%
Miler said New Hampshire's children are
 
06:45:05.990 --> 06:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
all of our children we have to work on
 
06:45:09.230 --> 06:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
our school funding system to help aid
 
06:45:12.750 --> 06:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
get directed to try and minimize
 
06:45:16.548 --> 06:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity gaps so that all students
 
06:45:18.750 --> 06:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity in New Hampshire
 
06:45:21.270 --> 06:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
that they need to live a good life I'll
 
06:45:23.548 --> 06:45:23.558 align:start position:0%
say that uh and Dave knows this and and
 
06:45:25.548 --> 06:45:25.558 align:start position:0%
represent land I've been around the
 
06:45:29.830 --> 06:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
state a long time I have helped uh Stan
 
06:45:32.270 --> 06:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
Arnold when he was Department of Revenue
 
06:45:34.548 --> 06:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
Commissioner helped uh Governor Shaheen
 
06:45:38.070 --> 06:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
with the ABC program in 1999 and 2000
 
06:45:40.468 --> 06:45:40.478 align:start position:0%
right after the second Claremont 2 case
 
06:45:43.590 --> 06:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
came down I've worked with uh Senator
 
06:45:46.350 --> 06:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
Fred King from colbrook one of the most
 
06:45:48.548 --> 06:45:48.558 align:start position:0%
wonderful legislators he said let's just
 
06:45:50.388 --> 06:45:50.398 align:start position:0%
use the State dollars that are precious
 
06:45:52.830 --> 06:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
and focus them on places that need it
 
06:45:56.030 --> 06:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
most I worked with Senator Carl Johnson
 
06:45:57.628 --> 06:45:57.638 align:start position:0%
from the middle party who said Bill
 
06:46:00.510 --> 06:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
can't we just take this money and focus
 
06:46:04.030 --> 06:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
it on the communities who need it
 
06:46:06.590 --> 06:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
most I worked with Governor John Lynch
 
06:46:10.468 --> 06:46:10.478 align:start position:0%
who proposed an ee plan eei plan Ned
 
06:46:13.590 --> 06:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
Gordon who's currently a rep was a
 
06:46:17.788 --> 06:46:17.798 align:start position:0%
Senator supported this idea this is not
 
06:46:21.190 --> 06:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
a Democrat or Republican idea the idea
 
06:46:24.868 --> 06:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
of helping eliminate opportunity gaps is
 
06:46:28.548 --> 06:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
one of our core responsibilities in the
 
06:46:30.628 --> 06:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
state whether you're an elected official
 
06:46:32.830 --> 06:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
as you all are or whether you're a
 
06:46:36.670 --> 06:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
citizen who's benefited from the system
 
06:46:39.430 --> 06:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
and cares about kids where we came from
 
06:46:43.670 --> 06:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is all about that is it
 
06:46:46.830 --> 06:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
complicated yes I would just like to
 
06:46:50.350 --> 06:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
focus you please on three items Mr chair
 
06:46:52.868 --> 06:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
and move on not walk through this thing
 
06:46:55.670 --> 06:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
if you look at page
 
06:47:00.590 --> 06:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
three what we see is a conclusion by the
 
06:47:02.510 --> 06:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
expert at our
 
06:47:05.948 --> 06:47:05.958 align:start position:0%
commission that in New
 
06:47:08.708 --> 06:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the communities that have
 
06:47:11.830 --> 06:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
higher relative
 
06:47:16.628 --> 06:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
poverty have lower relative spending
 
06:47:19.150 --> 06:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
capacity whereas in Massachusetts you
 
06:47:21.110 --> 06:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
can see the line is
 
06:47:23.628 --> 06:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
reversed is this on page three anyone
 
06:47:26.230 --> 06:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
see the graph there this is right out of
 
06:47:29.708 --> 06:47:29.718 align:start position:0%
the report of the expert I would say if
 
06:47:33.030 --> 06:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
we knew how to win with statistics on a
 
06:47:36.150 --> 06:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
good program New Hampshire's line would
 
06:47:39.670 --> 06:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
tilt from the way it is there which is
 
06:47:43.070 --> 06:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
regressive to A system that has got
 
06:47:45.468 --> 06:47:45.478 align:start position:0%
greater resources available to the
 
06:47:49.310 --> 06:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
communities who have greater uh poverty
 
06:47:51.590 --> 06:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
in their communities I would like to
 
06:47:56.310 --> 06:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
just focus on a comparison chart next if
 
06:48:00.110 --> 06:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
you go to page seven
 
06:48:03.830 --> 06:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
please page seven of that PowerPoint
 
06:48:05.110 --> 06:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
let's see if we get there there's a
 
06:48:06.230 --> 06:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
graph with
 
06:48:08.990 --> 06:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
bubbles it's got two graphs one on the
 
06:48:13.150 --> 06:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
top one on the bottom the top graph
 
06:48:18.110 --> 06:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
shows the current system all the towns
 
06:48:24.270 --> 06:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
are at about um right around 41 $100 per
 
06:48:27.590 --> 06:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
pupil in terms of their aid from the
 
06:48:30.548 --> 06:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
state and that's regardless of what
 
06:48:32.948 --> 06:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
their equalized valuation is that's
 
06:48:36.590 --> 06:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
almost a straight line that means in
 
06:48:39.070 --> 06:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
Claremont where I know there are greater
 
06:48:42.270 --> 06:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
challenges because I care deeply we won
 
06:48:43.868 --> 06:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
the state championship when I was in
 
06:48:45.670 --> 06:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
Claremont I was on basketball and
 
06:48:47.948 --> 06:48:47.958 align:start position:0%
baseball teams I see representative
 
06:48:49.910 --> 06:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
Allon who is a better basketball player
 
06:48:51.910 --> 06:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
than I am and so is representative mafa
 
06:48:53.670 --> 06:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
we played together in conquer
 
06:48:57.350 --> 06:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
I would say that it's it's terrible that
 
06:48:59.310 --> 06:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
Claremont is getting the same amount of
 
06:49:00.548 --> 06:49:00.558 align:start position:0%
money per
 
06:49:03.708 --> 06:49:03.718 align:start position:0%
pupil that Handover is getting there's
 
06:49:07.030 --> 06:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
something wrong with that that's
 
06:49:09.590 --> 06:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
different than any other state in the
 
06:49:11.830 --> 06:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
country there's no precedent for that
 
06:49:13.750 --> 06:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
how have we gotten there I'd like to
 
06:49:16.230 --> 06:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
show you what the foundation opportunity
 
06:49:19.468 --> 06:49:19.478 align:start position:0%
program does in the second graph in the
 
06:49:22.388 --> 06:49:22.398 align:start position:0%
second graph you see that there's a
 
06:49:22.398 --> 06:49:23.868 align:start position:0%
second graph you see that there's a
spread

06:49:23.868 --> 06:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
spread
 
06:49:27.110 --> 06:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
some communities get as high as a
 
06:49:29.548 --> 06:49:29.558 align:start position:0%
foundation budget of
 
06:49:32.190 --> 06:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
$116,000 others have a foundation budget
 
06:49:32.200 --> 06:49:33.388 align:start position:0%
$116,000 others have a foundation budget
of

06:49:33.388 --> 06:49:33.398 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:49:36.830 --> 06:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
8,000 this represents
 
06:49:40.910 --> 06:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
a an opportunity for this program to say
 
06:49:43.190 --> 06:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
I know there are opportunity gaps let's
 
06:49:44.350 --> 06:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
focus the
 
06:49:47.708 --> 06:49:47.718 align:start position:0%
resources that is the in a picture what
 
06:49:50.670 --> 06:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
this program does I would now just like
 
06:49:53.788 --> 06:49:53.798 align:start position:0%
to focus on one other page
 
06:49:57.990 --> 06:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
page uh actually two page
 
06:50:00.750 --> 06:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
10 everybody including the study
 
06:50:03.590 --> 06:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
committee is going to ask how does the
 
06:50:07.388 --> 06:50:07.398 align:start position:0%
math of this work how will there be
 
06:50:09.310 --> 06:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
impacts in my community and other
 
06:50:13.548 --> 06:50:13.558 align:start position:0%
communities well the formula is easy the
 
06:50:16.270 --> 06:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
doe will determine a foundation
 
06:50:18.910 --> 06:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget that's based on
 
06:50:22.350 --> 06:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
outcomes and opportunity gaps every
 
06:50:23.788 --> 06:50:23.798 align:start position:0%
Community will have have one it will
 
06:50:25.750 --> 06:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
differ by
 
06:50:30.190 --> 06:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
Community then there's a phas in period
 
06:50:31.830 --> 06:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
it takes about 10 years there's an
 
06:50:34.110 --> 06:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that has to be prepared that
 
06:50:35.830 --> 06:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative luno representative Ames
 
06:50:37.910 --> 06:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
other sponsors are working with uh to
 
06:50:39.708 --> 06:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
get it out of legislative Services it
 
06:50:41.830 --> 06:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
was very busy at ledge Services they're
 
06:50:44.270 --> 06:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
great there but that that's getting done
 
06:50:46.510 --> 06:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
but it's a 10-year phas
 
06:50:50.868 --> 06:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
in how does a community get its
 
06:50:53.830 --> 06:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget paid two
 
06:50:58.670 --> 06:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
sources one is it has a required
 
06:51:00.830 --> 06:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation and that appropriation is
 
06:51:03.910 --> 06:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
based takes into account its uh local
 
06:51:07.190 --> 06:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
property tax base and if there's any Gap
 
06:51:10.670 --> 06:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
left it gets a grant from the state
 
06:51:13.708 --> 06:51:13.718 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and the sum total
 
06:51:16.030 --> 06:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
of those grants in the first year with
 
06:51:19.750 --> 06:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
the phas and proposed mean no increase
 
06:51:23.070 --> 06:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
in the first year it is designed to try
 
06:51:26.310 --> 06:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
and have the same amount of funds that
 
06:51:28.590 --> 06:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
are currently being spent out of the
 
06:51:30.548 --> 06:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
education trust fund carry forward in
 
06:51:32.948 --> 06:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
that first year make no mistake about it
 
06:51:35.310 --> 06:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
the foundation opportunity program is
 
06:51:37.910 --> 06:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
designed to run over 10 years in a way
 
06:51:40.670 --> 06:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
that says public education is our
 
06:51:43.270 --> 06:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
state's top priority guess what it
 
06:51:46.548 --> 06:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
already is it's the highest component of
 
06:51:49.868 --> 06:51:49.878 align:start position:0%
spending State local plus the federal
 
06:51:52.430 --> 06:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
component of any other priority in the
 
06:51:55.628 --> 06:51:55.638 align:start position:0%
in the state state budget by far and
 
06:51:59.670 --> 06:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
that is important why as Mel Miler said
 
06:52:02.350 --> 06:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
because they're all our children I would
 
06:52:05.070 --> 06:52:05.080 align:start position:0%
I would like to say that and then if we
 
06:52:09.910 --> 06:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
go to fiscal impacts on page 11 the
 
06:52:14.190 --> 06:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
LBA has got this bill they are becoming
 
06:52:16.190 --> 06:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
familiar with it and they are working to
 
06:52:18.430 --> 06:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
prepare a fiscal note thank you again to
 
06:52:21.548 --> 06:52:21.558 align:start position:0%
Chairman lad to put into a work session
 
06:52:23.788 --> 06:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
to allow LBA with the crush of bills
 
06:52:25.750 --> 06:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
they've had you know nobody works harder
 
06:52:28.350 --> 06:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
than LBA and and they're working to get
 
06:52:32.150 --> 06:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
that we will see it but as I said one
 
06:52:34.350 --> 06:52:34.360 align:start position:0%
important part is that it's designed to
 
06:52:38.310 --> 06:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
fit within the general scheme of our
 
06:52:42.190 --> 06:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
budget importantly some towns don't get
 
06:52:43.548 --> 06:52:43.558 align:start position:0%
the same level of grant that they're
 
06:52:46.788 --> 06:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
getting now however this bill recognizes
 
06:52:50.190 --> 06:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
that you can't make unexpected impacts
 
06:52:53.990 --> 06:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
on uh communities local District budgets
 
06:52:56.548 --> 06:52:56.558 align:start position:0%
and it provides for transition grants
 
06:52:57.910 --> 06:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
that would
 
06:53:01.230 --> 06:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
protect communities from from drops in
 
06:53:03.708 --> 06:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
their grants and that would phase in
 
06:53:06.270 --> 06:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
Phase that that transition help would be
 
06:53:09.190 --> 06:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
there for five years where would the
 
06:53:11.468 --> 06:53:11.478 align:start position:0%
money come from that just like
 
06:53:13.830 --> 06:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has done they recognize
 
06:53:16.510 --> 06:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
that public education has been one of
 
06:53:19.510 --> 06:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
the most devastated institutions in our
 
06:53:22.948 --> 06:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
society from Co and the federal dollar
 
06:53:24.830 --> 06:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
that are available and I served on
 
06:53:27.190 --> 06:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
gopher uh that that the committee the
 
06:53:29.070 --> 06:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
advisory committee and I've helped
 
06:53:30.948 --> 06:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
really Democratic and Republican
 
06:53:34.548 --> 06:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
Governors do their budgets for 30 years
 
06:53:37.990 --> 06:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
um those federal dollars would be used
 
06:53:40.910 --> 06:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
to stabilize the transition to a fair
 
06:53:43.868 --> 06:53:43.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity for all students in New
 
06:53:47.230 --> 06:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh the last uh on page 12 the
 
06:53:49.150 --> 06:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
last slide I want to work on here is
 
06:53:54.030 --> 06:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
just to identify that this bill also has
 
06:53:57.830 --> 06:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
say property tax relief for low and
 
06:54:00.830 --> 06:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
moderate income individual homeowners
 
06:54:02.468 --> 06:54:02.478 align:start position:0%
you all haven't seen this bill but the
 
06:54:04.510 --> 06:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
house Ways and Means Committee has
 
06:54:07.510 --> 06:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative dick Ames has introduced
 
06:54:11.270 --> 06:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that would strengthen and
 
06:54:14.230 --> 06:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
clarify this property tax relief because
 
06:54:17.910 --> 06:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know who really needs it the people
 
06:54:20.190 --> 06:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
who have low and moderate incomes you
 
06:54:23.628 --> 06:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
don't need to Grant property tax relief
 
06:54:26.270 --> 06:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
to people who own million dooll
 
06:54:28.868 --> 06:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
properties they can pay the same rate
 
06:54:30.788 --> 06:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
that we all pay for the State Property
 
06:54:34.830 --> 06:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
Tax but let me tell you right now in our
 
06:54:38.270 --> 06:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
current law there is a bomb that's
 
06:54:41.110 --> 06:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
waiting to explode in our face and that
 
06:54:44.628 --> 06:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
is we do not collect excess State
 
06:54:47.230 --> 06:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
Property Tax from Whole towns what that
 
06:54:49.990 --> 06:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
means is there are different rates being
 
06:54:53.150 --> 06:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
paid our constitution is so strong wrong
 
06:54:55.510 --> 06:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
in protecting that all taxpayers must
 
06:54:58.270 --> 06:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
pay tax at the same rate that that is a
 
06:55:01.510 --> 06:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
risk to our state's public Fisk this
 
06:55:05.910 --> 06:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
bill would focus on fixing that problem
 
06:55:08.990 --> 06:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
and then making sure that taxpayers in
 
06:55:11.990 --> 06:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
towns that would see a tax increase when
 
06:55:14.070 --> 06:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
they're low in moderate income they get
 
06:55:16.830 --> 06:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
relief and this is wound into this bill
 
06:55:20.830 --> 06:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
too that is a quick overview of this
 
06:55:23.510 --> 06:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
bill the PowerPoint and the section by
 
06:55:25.708 --> 06:55:25.718 align:start position:0%
section is available for everyone the
 
06:55:28.788 --> 06:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
public to look at I would close Mr Chair
 
06:55:28.798 --> 06:55:29.830 align:start position:0%
public to look at I would close Mr Chair
by

06:55:29.830 --> 06:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
by
 
06:55:32.430 --> 06:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
saying every time public education
 
06:55:34.830 --> 06:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
funding has been done in the state since
 
06:55:38.830 --> 06:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
Claremont 2 it's been a crisis it's been
 
06:55:41.990 --> 06:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
out of control it's been raced it has
 
06:55:45.548 --> 06:55:45.558 align:start position:0%
not had clear guidance on principles but
 
06:55:48.990 --> 06:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
this bill does it is integrated it is
 
06:55:51.070 --> 06:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
got a lot of thought it is neither
 
06:55:53.230 --> 06:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
Republican nor Democrat
 
06:55:56.350 --> 06:55:56.360 align:start position:0%
it is about Fair funding that
 
06:55:58.990 --> 06:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
solves the opportunity gaps that we have
 
06:56:02.750 --> 06:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
in our state and I I I I couldn't say
 
06:56:03.788 --> 06:56:03.798 align:start position:0%
this more
 
06:56:07.788 --> 06:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
passionately that that rather than wait
 
06:56:10.070 --> 06:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
for the crisis to hit
 
06:56:13.430 --> 06:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
us we thank this committee for starting
 
06:56:15.510 --> 06:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
on the road towards a
 
06:56:19.190 --> 06:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
planned smart replacement for the
 
06:56:22.468 --> 06:56:22.478 align:start position:0%
current unfair broken and very likely
 
06:56:25.468 --> 06:56:25.478 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional system thank you Dave
 
06:56:27.510 --> 06:56:27.520 align:start position:0%

06:57:12.990 --> 06:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh some of the challenges that we're
 
06:57:15.628 --> 06:57:15.638 align:start position:0%
facing in terms of how we go about uh
 
06:57:18.150 --> 06:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
how we're currently funding schools and
 
06:57:21.270 --> 06:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh and helping us um really sort of see
 
06:57:24.548 --> 06:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh uh for uh for ways of
 
06:57:28.310 --> 06:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
of improving that not just not just for
 
06:57:32.150 --> 06:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
next year or two years but for uh for
 
06:57:34.948 --> 06:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
decades uh decades to come and uh you
 
06:57:37.350 --> 06:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
know one of the things Bill Bill didn't
 
06:57:41.230 --> 06:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
mention uh but alluded to is that uh is
 
06:57:43.230 --> 06:57:43.240 align:start position:0%
that you know we're we're at the
 
06:57:44.868 --> 06:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
beginning of this road yeah the
 
06:57:46.430 --> 06:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
commission did work but we're at the
 
06:57:49.030 --> 06:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
beginning now of the legislative process
 
06:57:51.590 --> 06:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
we're not coming to you coming to this
 
06:57:55.948 --> 06:57:55.958 align:start position:0%
committee with a fully cooked ready too
 
06:57:59.310 --> 06:57:59.320 align:start position:0%
um you know meal prep kit this is um
 
06:58:01.708 --> 06:58:01.718 align:start position:0%
this is something that we can work on uh
 
06:58:03.990 --> 06:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
together and it's important that we get
 
06:58:05.788 --> 06:58:05.798 align:start position:0%
started now because there's another shoe
 
06:58:08.788 --> 06:58:08.798 align:start position:0%
to drop do you want to do you want to
 
06:58:12.150 --> 06:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
talk the conell you do so well I'm not
 
06:58:14.708 --> 06:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
as equipped to do it as as our attorney
 
06:58:17.628 --> 06:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
uh U let me try quickly you all know the
 
06:58:20.150 --> 06:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
conille case is pending you know that
 
06:58:22.868 --> 06:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
the judge the local judge concluded that
 
06:58:24.788 --> 06:58:24.798 align:start position:0%
the current system on the spending
 
06:58:28.030 --> 06:58:28.040 align:start position:0%
funding side was unconstitutional it
 
06:58:29.590 --> 06:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
went to the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
06:58:31.708 --> 06:58:31.718 align:start position:0%
they said you got to hold a trial that
 
06:58:34.548 --> 06:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
trial is in summer of
 
06:58:37.388 --> 06:58:37.398 align:start position:0%
22 that judge will then look at the
 
06:58:42.270 --> 06:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:45.708 --> 06:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
$397 an adequate funding level to
 
06:58:48.388 --> 06:58:48.398 align:start position:0%
satisfy the Constitutional obligation we
 
06:58:50.590 --> 06:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
don't know how that's going to come out
 
06:58:53.150 --> 06:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
but there's a risk that that Court could
 
06:58:55.868 --> 06:58:55.878 align:start position:0%
conclude after trial that it's not
 
06:58:57.868 --> 06:58:57.878 align:start position:0%
enough and then it'll go on appeal to
 
06:59:00.150 --> 06:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court you know whether that
 
06:59:02.590 --> 06:59:02.600 align:start position:0%
will go because it's gone there every
 
06:59:05.548 --> 06:59:05.558 align:start position:0%
time the court will look at it and it'll
 
06:59:08.590 --> 06:59:08.600 align:start position:0%
remind the legislature again of its
 
06:59:14.388 --> 06:59:14.398 align:start position:0%
leadership role in establishing a sound
 
06:59:19.110 --> 06:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
fair system for funding public education
 
06:59:21.270 --> 06:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and that's why it's
 
06:59:23.628 --> 06:59:23.638 align:start position:0%
important that this commission did all
 
06:59:26.708 --> 06:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
the work it did uh has produced a
 
06:59:28.628 --> 06:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
recommendation and is not just sitting
 
06:59:30.830 --> 06:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
on its Laurels but bringing it forward
 
06:59:34.750 --> 06:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
to let this committee start work before
 
06:59:36.708 --> 06:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
there's a problem arising from the
 
06:59:38.708 --> 06:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
conville case or the Statewide property
 
06:59:40.948 --> 06:59:40.958 align:start position:0%
tax case and I do want to say right here
 
06:59:43.230 --> 06:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
I did note not only that representative
 
06:59:44.628 --> 06:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
Ellison was better at conquered
 
06:59:46.350 --> 06:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
basketball to me but representative
 
06:59:48.270 --> 06:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
Moffett was much better whether it's on
 
06:59:50.270 --> 06:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
the gaslighter or Joe Kings it's good to
 
06:59:53.030 --> 06:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
see you guys so great um thanks and
 
06:59:55.070 --> 06:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
we're happy to take uh take some
 
06:59:57.868 --> 06:59:57.878 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much and uh I
 
06:59:59.990 --> 07:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate your being able to give the
 
07:00:03.030 --> 07:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
overview of where this particular bill
 
07:00:05.948 --> 07:00:05.958 align:start position:0%
is going or would like to go uh a lot of
 
07:00:09.948 --> 07:00:09.958 align:start position:0%
work to be done the Gap is too large we
 
07:00:14.350 --> 07:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
got to as you say so I hope we can come
 
07:00:15.830 --> 07:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
up with something positive we have
 
07:00:18.750 --> 07:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
certainly tried over the years since
 
07:00:20.708 --> 07:00:20.718 align:start position:0%
I've been in this house and prior to my
 
07:00:22.910 --> 07:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
being in the house I don't know how many
 
07:00:25.350 --> 07:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
task force how many committees I do know
 
07:00:26.990 --> 07:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
how many and I just don't know if I can
 
07:00:29.868 --> 07:00:29.878 align:start position:0%
count that all in one hand and with the
 
07:00:32.750 --> 07:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
commission good stuff in in various
 
07:00:35.670 --> 07:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
parts of all that and but uh we just
 
07:00:38.110 --> 07:00:38.120 align:start position:0%
been chipping around the side and having
 
07:00:41.070 --> 07:00:41.080 align:start position:0%
gotten to where we need to go somehow we
 
07:00:43.990 --> 07:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
have to do that and let's put a good
 
07:00:45.910 --> 07:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
foot forward here and at this point in
 
07:00:48.150 --> 07:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
time we'll open this up to questions
 
07:00:51.270 --> 07:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
from those sitting here on the committee
 
07:00:54.190 --> 07:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:57.548 --> 07:00:57.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just one question
 
07:00:59.388 --> 07:00:59.398 align:start position:0%
something probably we need for our work
 
07:01:02.150 --> 07:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
session tax rates are only half the
 
07:01:05.430 --> 07:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
problem the cost average cost of housing
 
07:01:08.990 --> 07:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
is the other half for example $300,000
 
07:01:11.708 --> 07:01:11.718 align:start position:0%
house where I live may only be $100,000
 
07:01:14.070 --> 07:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
house in Berlin so if their tax rate is
 
07:01:16.070 --> 07:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
three times more we're paying the same
 
07:01:18.310 --> 07:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
taxes so that's something we need to
 
07:01:19.670 --> 07:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
work on look
 
07:01:22.590 --> 07:01:22.600 align:start position:0%
at okay thank thank you very much much
 
07:01:22.600 --> 07:01:23.548 align:start position:0%
at okay thank thank you very much much
thank

07:01:23.548 --> 07:01:23.558 align:start position:0%
thank
 
07:01:27.590 --> 07:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
youal further questions or
 
07:01:32.948 --> 07:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:37.270 --> 07:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative ruoff I think so it's a
 
07:01:41.030 --> 07:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:44.110 --> 07:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
ruoff and I and and that has moved from
 
07:01:48.070 --> 07:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
chesher yes to Rockingham I'm not a
 
07:01:50.948 --> 07:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
litigator but it did move is it is it in
 
07:01:50.958 --> 07:01:53.750 align:start position:0%
litigator but it did move is it is it in
Rock

07:01:53.750 --> 07:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
Rock
 
07:01:56.270 --> 07:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so that and it's in he kept control
 
07:01:58.788 --> 07:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
of the case when it when he moved and so
 
07:02:01.830 --> 07:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
yes it's judge R represent leus do you
 
07:02:02.788 --> 07:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
have a
 
07:02:06.030 --> 07:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
question um it's more of a well it is
 
07:02:07.910 --> 07:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
sort of a question I'm
 
07:02:07.920 --> 07:02:09.670 align:start position:0%
sort of a question I'm
wondering

07:02:09.670 --> 07:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
07:02:12.310 --> 07:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
um a lot of this is about money and
 
07:02:15.110 --> 07:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
getting money to districts but are you
 
07:02:17.548 --> 07:02:17.558 align:start position:0%
going to in the subcommittee and
 
07:02:21.070 --> 07:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
figuring this out how that money is
 
07:02:24.230 --> 07:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
actually going to help because what I've
 
07:02:26.948 --> 07:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
noticed there's a strong correlation
 
07:02:30.990 --> 07:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
between the academic maximum the
 
07:02:36.030 --> 07:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
academic level of the parents and the um
 
07:02:38.230 --> 07:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
achievement of the children and the
 
07:02:40.910 --> 07:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
question is how is this money that
 
07:02:43.350 --> 07:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
you're giving how are you going to make
 
07:02:46.388 --> 07:02:46.398 align:start position:0%
it hold the towns accountable to use it
 
07:02:49.468 --> 07:02:49.478 align:start position:0%
for something that's going to actually
 
07:02:52.628 --> 07:02:52.638 align:start position:0%
work to help bridge that Gap I see that
 
07:02:55.270 --> 07:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
as a much bigger Gap right and
 
07:02:56.708 --> 07:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
representative leakas thank you very
 
07:02:58.310 --> 07:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
much for that question that's a very
 
07:03:00.948 --> 07:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
important point and I think you you you
 
07:03:05.030 --> 07:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
tied the money into into accountability
 
07:03:08.150 --> 07:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
and student outcomes very very well
 
07:03:09.628 --> 07:03:09.638 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that I think
 
07:03:12.750 --> 07:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
we're most um excited about when it
 
07:03:15.430 --> 07:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
comes to the foundation opportunity plan
 
07:03:18.590 --> 07:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
because unlike an accountability system
 
07:03:22.590 --> 07:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
that's based on a bag of things like 30
 
07:03:25.030 --> 07:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
chairs and a teacher and one principal
 
07:03:27.510 --> 07:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
for every 500 kids and stuff like that I
 
07:03:29.030 --> 07:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
mean you could certainly add all those
 
07:03:31.350 --> 07:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
things up and find out if a district is
 
07:03:33.708 --> 07:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
spending their money on those things but
 
07:03:37.430 --> 07:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to um measure the uh the
 
07:03:40.110 --> 07:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
student performance and uh and hold
 
07:03:43.230 --> 07:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
districts accountable uh based on that
 
07:03:46.430 --> 07:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
and um and there's an entire section in
 
07:03:50.868 --> 07:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
the um um in in uh 1680 uh on
 
07:03:54.310 --> 07:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
accountability uh that uh that is that
 
07:03:57.230 --> 07:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
that that um ties back to Performance it
 
07:03:59.468 --> 07:03:59.478 align:start position:0%
ties back to data collection from the
 
07:04:01.670 --> 07:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
Department uh so that we can continue to
 
07:04:04.628 --> 07:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
improve our ability to uh to measure
 
07:04:07.510 --> 07:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
student outcomes and um and support
 
07:04:10.190 --> 07:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
districts so that uh student outcomes
 
07:04:12.708 --> 07:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
meet the um meet the the outcome
 
07:04:14.948 --> 07:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
standard that we've defined for an
 
07:04:14.958 --> 07:04:16.030 align:start position:0%
standard that we've defined for an
adequate

07:04:16.030 --> 07:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
07:04:18.830 --> 07:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
education yeah may I add just one I
 
07:04:22.110 --> 07:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
thought an excellent question I agree uh
 
07:04:24.510 --> 07:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for it I want to say that the
 
07:04:25.868 --> 07:04:25.878 align:start position:0%
court in
 
07:04:28.510 --> 07:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
Clara Supreme Court in those Clara cases
 
07:04:32.230 --> 07:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
has always said you can't have a system
 
07:04:35.030 --> 07:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
that satisfies the Constitutional duty
 
07:04:37.270 --> 07:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
to provide a decent public education
 
07:04:39.750 --> 07:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
without an accountability system we've
 
07:04:41.670 --> 07:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
struggled for years to have an
 
07:04:44.430 --> 07:04:44.440 align:start position:0%
accountability system because the data
 
07:04:48.030 --> 07:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
measuring outcomes has been new and
 
07:04:50.750 --> 07:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
hesitant in our committee meetings it
 
07:04:53.110 --> 07:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
was clear that for the first time we
 
07:04:57.310 --> 07:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
have built a database of outcomes data
 
07:05:01.388 --> 07:05:01.398 align:start position:0%
that allows a check on whether the
 
07:05:04.230 --> 07:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
outcome Gap the opportunity Gap has been
 
07:05:07.030 --> 07:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
closed and this is require this bill
 
07:05:10.788 --> 07:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
requires every 10 years a recalculation
 
07:05:13.670 --> 07:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
that is transparent and produces data
 
07:05:16.948 --> 07:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
that the public the legislature courts
 
07:05:18.990 --> 07:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
can look at to see whether there's a
 
07:05:21.708 --> 07:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
closing of the opportunity Gap that is a
 
07:05:24.350 --> 07:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
something that has been missing in past
 
07:05:27.708 --> 07:05:27.718 align:start position:0%
uh efforts to resolve this horrible
 
07:05:31.548 --> 07:05:31.558 align:start position:0%
problem that has drained energy of great
 
07:05:33.670 --> 07:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
elected officials for so long we should
 
07:05:33.680 --> 07:05:36.110 align:start position:0%
elected officials for so long we should
fix

07:05:36.110 --> 07:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:39.430 --> 07:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
it are there further
 
07:05:42.270 --> 07:05:42.280 align:start position:0%

afternoon on House Bill 1680 in view of
 
07:06:23.670 --> 07:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
the hour I'll attempt to be brief um and
 
07:06:26.388 --> 07:06:26.398 align:start position:0%
just try to hit some key points for the
 
07:06:28.350 --> 07:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
record my name is Jeff mcclinch and I'm
 
07:06:29.350 --> 07:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
the Project Director of the New
 
07:06:30.750 --> 07:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school funding fairness
 
07:06:32.708 --> 07:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
project as the members of the committee
 
07:06:34.430 --> 07:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
have just heard uh New Hampshire's
 
07:06:37.030 --> 07:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
school funding system suffers at present
 
07:06:38.830 --> 07:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
from a pair of injustices and has for
 
07:06:40.990 --> 07:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
some time both deep in enduring
 
07:06:43.350 --> 07:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
inequities an educational opportunity
 
07:06:44.990 --> 07:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
and enormous differences in the property
 
07:06:47.310 --> 07:06:47.320 align:start position:0%
taxes we pay as residents and business
 
07:06:49.708 --> 07:06:49.718 align:start position:0%
owners to support Public Schools the
 
07:06:51.030 --> 07:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
tremendous gap between what the state
 
07:06:52.350 --> 07:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
has determined be the cost of an
 
07:06:55.310 --> 07:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
adequate education about $4,700 per
 
07:06:57.868 --> 07:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
pupil and the cost communities actually
 
07:07:01.388 --> 07:07:01.398 align:start position:0%
face roughly $199,300 per student on
 
07:07:04.350 --> 07:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
average as of the most recent data are
 
07:07:06.468 --> 07:07:06.478 align:start position:0%
glaring Testament to these injustices as
 
07:07:08.750 --> 07:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
our school property tax rates that range
 
07:07:08.760 --> 07:07:10.190 align:start position:0%
our school property tax rates that range
from

07:07:10.190 --> 07:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:07:13.030 --> 07:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
$227 uh cents to
 
07:07:16.750 --> 07:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
$20.89 per thousand of value these two
 
07:07:19.190 --> 07:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
injustices arise from a single Source
 
07:07:20.948 --> 07:07:20.958 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire has failed
 
07:07:23.230 --> 07:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
for decades AES to fulfill its
 
07:07:24.868 --> 07:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
fundamental constitutional
 
07:07:26.708 --> 07:07:26.718 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide an adequate
 
07:07:28.270 --> 07:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
education to every child within its
 
07:07:30.510 --> 07:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
borders instead it has shifted that
 
07:07:32.430 --> 07:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility onto local property
 
07:07:34.388 --> 07:07:34.398 align:start position:0%
taxpayers forcing them to Bear
 
07:07:36.510 --> 07:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
approximately $2.3 billion dollar in
 
07:07:39.070 --> 07:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
costs each year costs that should be met
 
07:07:41.510 --> 07:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
with State revenues the only way to
 
07:07:43.750 --> 07:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
revenue these injustices is to end that
 
07:07:45.990 --> 07:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
downshifting and to create a system that
 
07:07:47.310 --> 07:07:47.320 align:start position:0%
enables the state of New Hampshire to
 
07:07:50.430 --> 07:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
meet at long last its core educational
 
07:07:52.628 --> 07:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
responsibilities the bill before you
 
07:07:54.830 --> 07:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
this afternoon 1680 would take
 
07:07:56.510 --> 07:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
meaningful steps towards alleviating
 
07:07:58.708 --> 07:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
some of the disparities now emic in
 
07:08:00.190 --> 07:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school funding system and I
 
07:08:01.230 --> 07:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to belabor these points
 
07:08:03.310 --> 07:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
because I'm H happy to hear that there's
 
07:08:04.868 --> 07:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
going to be a a study committee that
 
07:08:06.590 --> 07:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
looks at this or subcommittee but there
 
07:08:08.230 --> 07:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
are three changes in particular it stand
 
07:08:11.030 --> 07:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
out first consistent with as you've
 
07:08:12.830 --> 07:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
heard rigorous statistical analyses
 
07:08:14.628 --> 07:08:14.638 align:start position:0%
conducted by the American Institutes of
 
07:08:16.628 --> 07:08:16.638 align:start position:0%
research the bill would modify the
 
07:08:18.830 --> 07:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
current adequacy Aid formula to ensure
 
07:08:20.708 --> 07:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
that the distribution of such Aid better
 
07:08:21.910 --> 07:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
reflects the need needs of school
 
07:08:23.910 --> 07:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
districts and the student populations
 
07:08:23.920 --> 07:08:24.548 align:start position:0%
districts and the student populations
they

07:08:24.548 --> 07:08:24.558 align:start position:0%
they
 
07:08:27.670 --> 07:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
serve second 1680 would mitigate some of
 
07:08:29.190 --> 07:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
the variation in school property tax
 
07:08:31.590 --> 07:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
rates now faced by different homeowners
 
07:08:33.708 --> 07:08:33.718 align:start position:0%
and businesses in different parts of the
 
07:08:35.868 --> 07:08:35.878 align:start position:0%
state by requiring municipalities to
 
07:08:37.948 --> 07:08:37.958 align:start position:0%
perit the full amount of the existing
 
07:08:40.510 --> 07:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax to the state
 
07:08:42.750 --> 07:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
treasury third the bill at ease the
 
07:08:44.430 --> 07:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
economic hardship school property taxes
 
07:08:46.510 --> 07:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
can create for low-income granted
 
07:08:49.030 --> 07:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
Staters by expanding eligibility for the
 
07:08:50.788 --> 07:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
existing homeowners property tax relief
 
07:08:52.990 --> 07:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
program and by substantially increasing
 
07:08:54.430 --> 07:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
the value of the rebates the program
 
07:08:57.628 --> 07:08:57.638 align:start position:0%
pays out nevertheless as it's currently
 
07:09:00.510 --> 07:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
written H Bill 1680 would fall short of
 
07:09:01.948 --> 07:09:01.958 align:start position:0%
attaining the kind of comprehensive
 
07:09:04.030 --> 07:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
reform needed to ensure the state of New
 
07:09:05.830 --> 07:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fulfills its constitutional
 
07:09:07.788 --> 07:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide an adequate
 
07:09:10.388 --> 07:09:10.398 align:start position:0%
education to every child in particular
 
07:09:12.030 --> 07:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
an establishing a minimum Foundation
 
07:09:14.510 --> 07:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
budget contribution equal in some cases
 
07:09:17.750 --> 07:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
to $5 per thousand of value the bill
 
07:09:20.150 --> 07:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
would require local property taxpayers
 
07:09:21.788 --> 07:09:21.798 align:start position:0%
to continue to help find Finance the
 
07:09:24.110 --> 07:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
provision of inadequate education a duty
 
07:09:26.750 --> 07:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
that lies squarely with the state as the
 
07:09:28.230 --> 07:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court made abundantly clear in
 
07:09:31.830 --> 07:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
its 2006 lary ruling whatever the state
 
07:09:33.830 --> 07:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
identifies as comprising constitutional
 
07:09:36.910 --> 07:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
adequacy it must pay for none of that
 
07:09:38.670 --> 07:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
financial obligation can be shifted to
 
07:09:40.750 --> 07:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
local school districts regardless of
 
07:09:43.190 --> 07:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
their relative wealth or need in
 
07:09:45.110 --> 07:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
addition in making the changes noted to
 
07:09:47.628 --> 07:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
the U current adequacy Formula the bill
 
07:09:49.910 --> 07:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
likely or ultimately entails an increase
 
07:09:51.990 --> 07:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
in the total amount of it such the state
 
07:09:54.350 --> 07:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
may distribute in a given year though as
 
07:09:56.468 --> 07:09:56.478 align:start position:0%
was uh acknowledged there's not yet a
 
07:09:58.350 --> 07:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on the bill so the extent of
 
07:10:00.628 --> 07:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
that increase isn't known over time now
 
07:10:02.030 --> 07:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
to be sure the state should be
 
07:10:04.670 --> 07:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
increasing uh St such Aid so that
 
07:10:06.190 --> 07:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
localities are not forced to pay the
 
07:10:08.830 --> 07:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
Lion Share of cost for public education
 
07:10:10.270 --> 07:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
however beyond the restoration of the
 
07:10:12.628 --> 07:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
swept as a true Statewide tax the bill
 
07:10:14.030 --> 07:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
does not appear to include a permanent
 
07:10:16.310 --> 07:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
state revenue source to support any such
 
07:10:18.788 --> 07:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
increase in Aid so in closing I'm
 
07:10:21.548 --> 07:10:21.558 align:start position:0%
heartened to hear that uh the the bill
 
07:10:23.628 --> 07:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
will be continue to be considered uh in
 
07:10:25.948 --> 07:10:25.958 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee and I hope that U we at
 
07:10:27.230 --> 07:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
the school funding fairness project will
 
07:10:28.350 --> 07:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
have a chance to work with the sponsors
 
07:10:30.190 --> 07:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
of the bill and all the members of this
 
07:10:32.708 --> 07:10:32.718 align:start position:0%
committee and that subcommittee um to
 
07:10:35.388 --> 07:10:35.398 align:start position:0%
address these concerns and ultimately to
 
07:10:36.670 --> 07:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
build a school funding system that
 
07:10:38.750 --> 07:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
fulfills the State's responsibilities
 
07:10:40.310 --> 07:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
and leads to Greater equity for students
 
07:10:42.670 --> 07:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
and taxpayers like again I thank you for
 
07:10:44.230 --> 07:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
the chance to be here this afternoon and
 
07:10:45.510 --> 07:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions you
 
07:10:47.788 --> 07:10:47.798 align:start position:0%

so no it's just a huge task uh it
 
07:11:16.350 --> 07:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
certainly is and there's a long path
 
07:11:19.910 --> 07:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
that has to be taken so um we'll work
 
07:11:22.910 --> 07:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
towards it um so no further questions
 
07:11:24.190 --> 07:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
and I don't see are there any other
 
07:11:26.468 --> 07:11:26.478 align:start position:0%
cards which we have here so we don't
 
07:11:29.110 --> 07:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
have that so we will close this hearing
 
07:11:31.990 --> 07:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
and and as I stated for I am appointing
 
07:11:34.548 --> 07:11:34.558 align:start position:0%
