00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:03.730 align:start position:0%
 
afternoon

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
please take your seats I'm still waiting
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
for some more finance committee members
 
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
I'm working on my list
 
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
I got to catch some people here while
 
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
good morning good afternoon
 
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
I thank you all for coming
 
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
to learn about the most important vote
 
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
you take in your career as a State Rep
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
remember that we have a special place in
 
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
the Constitution all money bills must
 
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
originate in the House of
 
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
Representatives because we are closest
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
to the people
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
so we all get to talk with people we all
 
00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:34.019 align:start position:0%
get to tell them about what we're doing
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
and they may be questioning some of your
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
votes on the budget
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
so this is my 15th budget
 
00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
I was proud to be the chair of the
 
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
O'Brien budget when I was told to cut
 
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
the budget 10 and we managed to do that
 
00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:56.339 align:start position:0%
but this is another unprecedented budget
 
00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:58.740 align:start position:0%
one of the guidelines we used called a
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
tax expender tax expenditure limitations
 
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
was to look at
 
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
the amount of time since the last budget
 
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
look at the inflation over that period
 
00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
and the population growth over that
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
period add the two together and that
 
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
should be a never exceed number in the
 
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
past it's been running three four
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
percent and we were always under it in
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
all the budgets and sometimes we cut the
 
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
budget to let to less than previous
 
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
we've done that at least once by 10
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
percent as I said
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
but now
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
we've never had as much inflation
 
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
in the last 40 some years as we have had
 
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.389 align:start position:0%
in the last 40 some years as we have had
now

00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
so when I look at those two figures
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
what's been the two years inflation
 
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
12.7 percent
 
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
what's the population increase 1.5
 
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
percent added together
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
14.2 would be some people would use as
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
tax expenditure limitation
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
14.2 we're not going that high
 
00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:12.500 align:start position:0%
but we are going to a record increase
 
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry well for me a record increase
 
00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:20.339 align:start position:0%
but not for some of the previous budgets
 
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
why are we doing this because everything
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
is more expensive
 
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
the diesel fuel the gasoline the
 
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
groceries and everything that everybody
 
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.710 align:start position:0%
groceries and everything that everybody
pays

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
pays
 
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.970 align:start position:0%
pays
so

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
the governor and his executive privilege
 
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
negotiated with the employees union
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
and is giving them in 2004 10 2005 an
 
00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
additional 2 12 percent
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
what did we just find out that's about
 
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
what the inflation has been that's what
 
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
we'd all like to see that we get in
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
inflation we did those of us on Social
 
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
Security get an eight percent year over
 
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
year with some reflection
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:06.779 align:start position:0%
that's going to be some big increases in
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
this budget I'm sorry to say I'm not in
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
favor of them but nevertheless
 
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
we're still planned to cut
 
00:12:17.329 --> 00:12:17.339 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax so that it
 
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
ends in January 2005 rather than up to
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
2007. there's enough Revenue coming in
 
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
that we can afford that
 
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.190 align:start position:0%
that we can afford that
Plus

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
Plus
 
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
this is the closest divided house that
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
I've ever seen
 
00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:38.459 align:start position:0%
so we have to get votes on both sides
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
or we wouldn't pass it
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
there are people that hate something
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
about it on both sides there are people
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
that like something about it on both
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
sides we're hopeful that there's more
 
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
people who like it than dislike it
 
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.410 align:start position:0%
people who like it than dislike it
because

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
I've never had a budget that I loved
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
everything in it there were things I
 
00:12:59.930 --> 00:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
really held my breath and held my nose
 
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
before I put him in the budget but
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
I had to do it to get the votes
 
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
there's no other way we're all here no
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
one wants politics is about
 
00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:11.459 align:start position:0%
it's never that easy
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
even when you think everybody's on your
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
side especially one of the reasons the
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
Constitution put it here
 
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
is if you can please Most of 400 people
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
are now 399 then you can pass a budget
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
we've all got to be involved in this
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm delighted to hear who
 
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
answer all your questions we'll do our
 
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
best to explain what we have done
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
and remember in this same house
 
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
while we were doing this budget we
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
passed 50 of the but 50 of the house
 
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.370 align:start position:0%
passed 50 of the but 50 of the house
bills

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
that had money in them
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
when we include all those in the budget
 
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
that's another 165 million dollars
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
but it was voted out of this house so we
 
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
are compelled as the finance committee
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
if all of us voted for something You're
 
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
darn well better put it in the budget
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise there's going to be an
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to add it afterwards anyway
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
because it was well supported
 
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
so there are things in there
 
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.290 align:start position:0%
so there are things in there
that

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
some of us maybe dislike strongly
 
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.370 align:start position:0%
some of us maybe dislike strongly
but

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
we've got to keep this state running
 
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
if we vote this budget down
 
00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:25.139 align:start position:0%
then we have no choice we'll be stuck
 
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
with what the Senate does they don't
 
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
even have to consult us they don't even
 
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
have to committee a conference if we
 
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
don't have something to meet them with
 
00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
we have nothing
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
and some of the things that a lot of
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
people wanted
 
00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:39.779 align:start position:0%
are gone possibly
 
00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:41.509 align:start position:0%
are gone possibly
so

00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do is we'll go
 
00:14:44.449 --> 00:14:44.459 align:start position:0%
through division by division because
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
that's what we do we have so much to do
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
on a budget we divided into three
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittees division one two and three
 
00:14:53.449 --> 00:14:53.459 align:start position:0%
and we specialize each of those budgets
 
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
in various parts of the budget we are
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have a lot of returning
 
00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
members that have remembered things that
 
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
were said and things that were done in
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
previous budgets
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
when you hear the same song and dance
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
you might be a little bit resistant
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
until we remember what they told you two
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
years before and you found out it was BS
 
00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:16.430 align:start position:0%
years before and you found out it was BS
so

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
the highlights are
 
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
it's a balanced budget
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:28.820 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment provides
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
15.89 billion in total fund
 
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
Appropriations we're fortunate the
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
Appropriations have done well some of it
 
00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:38.339 align:start position:0%
have happened in this fiscal year and
 
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
were able to bring that Surplus forward
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment provides 6.37
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
billion in general and education trust
 
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
fund don't believe the baloney because
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
we're trying to align the education
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
trust fund to its historical and
 
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
original purpose
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
what it has come to be evolved as an
 
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
education slush fund and people keep
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
looking for places to spend more
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
education funds
 
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
the intent of it when I was here in 1999
 
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
when we created it I was on the
 
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
committee that decided what went into
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy and we funded adequacy and we
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
deliberately kept the money that went
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
into the to the to the tax the education
 
00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
trust fund below what was needed for
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
adequacy because if it exceeded it that
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
money was couldn't be used anywhere else
 
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
so we had to make sure education trust
 
00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:37.139 align:start position:0%
fund just covered adequacy everything
 
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
else special they had meals and the free
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
and reduced third grade reading building
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
Aid all came out of general fund always
 
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years so these people that
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
are saying oh you're taking money away
 
00:16:53.569 --> 00:16:53.579 align:start position:0%
from education is bull
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
we have increased the money being spent
 
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
on education
 
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
and we are trying to align the education
 
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
trust fund with its historical and
 
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
original Roots because we can't put
 
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
everything there when we need some of it
 
00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:09.419 align:start position:0%
in general fund all the sources of it of
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
not all the sources but the main sources
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
of the education trust fund of the
 
00:17:15.289 --> 00:17:15.299 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
up to 50 percent of them were going in
 
00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:20.579 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund the governor
 
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
would have proposed to cut it to 35
 
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
percent we took a look at it and cut it
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
to 22 percent there is still plenty of
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
money going to adequacy and a few other
 
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
things in education that we couldn't
 
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
pair it down quite enough so the
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is in good shape
 
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
and we're able to balance the budget a
 
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.029 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
we have eliminated as I said the
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends taxed on January
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
1st 2025 two years earlier than
 
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
the committee Amendment appropriates 50
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
million to accelerate the elimination of
 
00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:04.100 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Retirement Systems
 
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
unfunded Actuarial accrued liability
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
and we also hope to put money into the
 
00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.299 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
it was hit to a hundred million dollars
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
in this last biennium because of the
 
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
money needed for the sununu Youth Center
 
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
and the and the Youth Detention Center
 
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
to pay for the lawsuits which are now
 
00:18:27.409 --> 00:18:27.419 align:start position:0%
ongoing and
 
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
of course we don't listen to a lawyer
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
who says more and more and more but
 
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:33.539 align:start position:0%
anyway as 100 million we took out of
 
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund but now having to try to
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
build that back up
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
we hope at the end of this biennium
 
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
it'll go back up to 200 million and if
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
it everything works out in this next
 
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
biennium we might add another 50 million
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully if everything works out
 
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.140 align:start position:0%
hopefully if everything works out
so

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:50.150 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:51.289 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

00:18:51.289 --> 00:18:51.299 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
I've got all my paperwork here to help
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
with any questions you have answered
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated long thing
 
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
so what I'd like to do is is call uh
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
representative Peter leishman up to
 
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
brief us on the book here you turn to
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
part for division
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
division one and he's been hired at work
 
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
because he has the most departments
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
to deal with in division one and he will
 
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
tell you about that right now
 
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
so representative leishman
 
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman before I
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
go too much into the presentation from
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
division one which you'll find on page
 
00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:33.539 align:start position:0%
six I'd like to thank a few people first
 
00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:36.539 align:start position:0%
I'd like to recognize Mike and Melissa
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
with the LBA they're sitting over in the
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
corner without their expertise and help
 
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
I certainly wouldn't be standing up here
 
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:48.770 align:start position:0%
I certainly wouldn't be standing up here
[Applause]

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
then those of on division one that
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
brought this together as far as division
 
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
one representative McGuire who served as
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
and then next to him representative
 
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
and then next to him representative
cambrells

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:06.370 align:start position:0%
cambrells
 
00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.289 align:start position:0%
cambrells
[Applause]

00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:09.299 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
and another spot below we have
 
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.529 align:start position:0%
representative evil
[Applause]

00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:18.539 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
so again I direct your attention to page
 
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
six and what does division one do well
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
it's easier to tell you what we don't do
 
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
so we don't do anything with the
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
safety Fish and Game Lottery
 
00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:37.270 align:start position:0%
safety Fish and Game Lottery
transportation

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
and education in the Lottery Commission
 
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
so everything else in government that's
 
00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:46.740 align:start position:0%
we try to handle and I have to say our
 
00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
group was very bipartisan when I stepped
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
into this role I've only been on finance
 
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
for eight terms unlike a chair behind me
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
but I thought it might be very
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
interesting and maybe have become a
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
difficult task with a split vote but it
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
was actually the easiest
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
group of people I've ever worked with so
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
again I thank you so turning to page six
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
I'll go through these rather quickly and
 
00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:15.419 align:start position:0%
if somebody has a specific question if
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
you want to just raise your hand in the
 
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
chair behind me will recognize you I'm
 
00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.510 align:start position:0%
chair behind me will recognize you I'm
sure

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
so going to the Department of
 
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
Information Technology we established a
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
Chief privacy officer this was because
 
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
of some of the privacy concerns that
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
have going on within State internet
 
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.510 align:start position:0%
have going on within State internet
access

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.470 align:start position:0%
access
Etc

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.610 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
Services

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:36.620 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
there's an important thing here probably
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
one of the most important things we
 
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
discuss within division was the pay
 
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
raise for our state employees so there's
 
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:49.940 align:start position:0%
over 9 100 state employees that were
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
based on what we've done in division one
 
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
in our full committee supported giving
 
00:21:59.690 --> 00:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
those employees a 10 increase in 24 in a
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
again this is a substantial amount of
 
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:08.780 align:start position:0%
money you'll see at the bottom of the
 
00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
bullet it's about 225 million dollars
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
going to um
 
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
we're going to invest 21 million dollars
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
into the granite place I think some of
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
you have heard that we thought it was
 
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
more appropriate use some of our Surplus
 
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
money instead of leasing the facility to
 
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
invest in it by purchasing
 
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh we also set aside additional funds of
 
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
1.2 million dollars
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
for work and relocation of staff at the
 
00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:42.539 align:start position:0%
State House Annex which is under
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%
renovation at this point
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
we also had a significant new ask from
 
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
Services of 3.6 million dollars that's
 
00:22:57.289 --> 00:22:57.299 align:start position:0%
the last bullet on page six this is
 
00:22:59.810 --> 00:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
because of our crumbling infrastructure
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sure all of you are aware that we
 
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
have many many dozens of buildings many
 
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
of which need roofs or other
 
00:23:08.529 --> 00:23:08.539 align:start position:0%
improvements so that was a new request
 
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
that was not in the governor's budget
 
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
going to page seven the office of child
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
advocate we had some additional
 
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
Appropriations there about a little more
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
than two hundred thousand dollars
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
for travel and additional funding for
 
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
training this is a very important agency
 
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
that we oversee protecting children so
 
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
they were looking for additional money
 
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
that the governor did not approve in his
 
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.890 align:start position:0%
that the governor did not approve in his
budget

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
so going to the Department of Revenue
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
we have funded two new positions there
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
this will they'll be responsible for
 
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
out-of-states audits this will increase
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
some of our Revenue perhaps as much as
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
and I'll skip some of these uh probably
 
00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:03.059 align:start position:0%
more boring but again if anyone has any
 
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
questions just sing out
 
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
um we're also adding additional funding
 
00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:10.820 align:start position:0%
for two technical staff
 
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
positions through the department of
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
Information Technology to work with the
 
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:21.409 --> 00:24:21.419 align:start position:0%
you'll see at the bottom of the
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
we're adding 75 million 75
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
000 for additional replacement for
 
00:24:33.649 --> 00:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
vehicles again not in the governance
 
00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:35.390 align:start position:0%
vehicles again not in the governance
budget

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
now this the next one the state
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
treasurer we've heard a lot about this
 
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing fund initially
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
this was a 25 million dollar request
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
we lowered it to 15 million dollars
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
back as far as I think it was around
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
March 12th we were exceeding the
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
position where we should be by about 145
 
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
million dollars so the division had to
 
00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:03.299 align:start position:0%
find something that cut all it cuts are
 
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
difficult but this is one of the areas
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
we looked at and we removed as you can
 
00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.909 align:start position:0%
we looked at and we removed as you can
see

00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars from that line
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps that will be restored at some
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
point we kept the program in place uh
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
initially all the funding for this
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
particular item was federal funds so
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
so the board of tax and land appeals a
 
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
bottom of page seven
 
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
we're looking to upgrade their database
 
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
this is again an additional request that
 
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
wasn't initially seen I believe in the
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
so going to page eight
 
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
now this is a very dealing with a New
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system the division
 
00:25:53.649 --> 00:25:53.659 align:start position:0%
spent an awful lot of time
 
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
on this particular area I want to
 
00:25:59.450 --> 00:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
personally thank representative Carol
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
McGuire that the chair of Edna Carol was
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
very close with us and worked very
 
00:26:09.649 --> 00:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
tightly with us during this process we
 
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:12.140 align:start position:0%
had a representative Pearson
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
involved representative goalie and
 
00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:18.419 align:start position:0%
representative Jackie groda so this is a
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
very bipartisan effort and the first one
 
00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
you have here with House Bill 436 came
 
00:26:26.769 --> 00:26:26.779 align:start position:0%
out of the house with a strong vote of
 
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
282 to 80 and as you heard the chairman
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
say earlier we were given bills to fund
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
and we made every attempt to fund them
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
either at a portion of the request or
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
their full amount
 
00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:42.539 align:start position:0%
so we did fund if you will I I like to
 
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
call this as a a fairness fairness issue
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
a decision for some of you that are
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
familiar familiar with this back in 2010
 
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
2011 there was some rollbacks on
 
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
benefits to employees it had not
 
00:26:59.810 --> 00:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
invested we've reestablished those
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
earlier Provisions that were rolled back
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
to bring them current where they should
 
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
be so that was a very good decision I
 
00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:09.500 align:start position:0%
Believe by our group
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
again this will be totally funded with
 
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
State funds it's about 25 million
 
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
and this became
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
an interesting working session at the
 
00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:27.179 align:start position:0%
fundus we repealed the repeal of the
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
communications tax which is 28 almost 29
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year so we repealed
 
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
that which gave us an additional 40
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
million dollars to offset the cost of
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
these retirement changes now we also
 
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
agreed to pick up the municipal shares
 
00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
as well so there's no Municipal impact
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
there was some current concern by the
 
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
municipal Association that there'll be
 
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
some pushback for them to pay for this
 
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
but there is none
 
00:27:59.690 --> 00:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
we also changed a bill was it house bill
 
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
50 representative McGuire
 
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.830 align:start position:0%
50 representative McGuire
yes

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
that initially there was going to be a
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
7.5 percent payback to towns towards
 
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
their retirement cost we thought it was
 
00:28:15.289 --> 00:28:15.299 align:start position:0%
more appropriate to put that money
 
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
towards the unfunded liability of 50
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
million dollars so I thought that was a
 
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
very good move and then finally with
 
00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.110 align:start position:0%
very good move and then finally with
retirement

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
we had a group two
 
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
cost of living adjustment this will
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
affect about 3 700 retirees
 
00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
um we thought that and it was just for
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
one year the initial bill I believe that
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
was brought forward by representative
 
00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
Broody for about 10 years but we reduced
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
it to a one-time maximum payment of
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
so another issue going to the office of
 
00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:54.740 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
this required a great deal of work I
 
00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
think many of you have heard from
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
Foresters soil scientists Landscape
 
00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:06.059 align:start position:0%
Architects and many others how upset
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
they were about these changes without
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
the policy committee e-dna really having
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
a first crack at it so we were as you
 
00:29:14.529 --> 00:29:14.539 align:start position:0%
can see removed about
 
00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:18.539 align:start position:0%
249 sections replacing
 
00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
several back and I'd actually like to
 
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
represent or recognize representative
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
McGuire Deanne McGuire who works so
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
closely on this and came up with some
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
good compromise and do you like to speak
 
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
at all to that yeah just briefly
 
00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:37.559 align:start position:0%
um we basically left in only things that
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
are very minor license changes
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
um it eliminated the Hawkers and
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
pavelers license the itinerant vendor's
 
00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:47.470 align:start position:0%
pavelers license the itinerant vendor's
license

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
and the athlete agent's license and and
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
it did some cleanup because we're in
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
general we're moving to
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
a setup where the the administration of
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
licenses is done by a professional set
 
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
of Staff called the oplc office of
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and
 
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
um so the boards themselves will be
 
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
dealing with their technical aspects you
 
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
know what kind of EDU education what
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
kind of testing that sort of stuff but
 
00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:24.059 align:start position:0%
all the administrative work of
 
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
processing applications taking fees
 
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
doing adjudication will be done by
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
professional staff and so we left in
 
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
some of the cleanup sort of stuff
 
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
related to that none of what's in there
 
00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:42.299 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we received any
 
00:30:45.169 --> 00:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
complaints about or nearly none so so
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
all the controversial thing about
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
certain licenses being combined or
 
00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
eliminated and so on that's all going to
 
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
be for future legislation
 
00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:03.889 --> 00:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
so turning the page to page nine the
 
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
we included basically we supported the
 
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
judicial branch again this is a branch
 
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
of government and in all my terms on
 
00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:19.220 align:start position:0%
finance we've generally
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
agreed with most if not all of their
 
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.110 align:start position:0%
agreed with most if not all of their
requests

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
requests
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
um as you'll see here we approve seven
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
new circuit court judges and one
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
Superior Court judge and the one
 
00:31:35.049 --> 00:31:35.059 align:start position:0%
Superior Court Judge came from
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn's bill which is
 
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 347 that was passed by the
 
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
house providing an additional Superior
 
00:31:45.289 --> 00:31:45.299 align:start position:0%
Court judge that would be primarily
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
focusing on planning zoning land use
 
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.870 align:start position:0%
focusing on planning zoning land use
issues

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
so moving to the Department of military
 
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
Affairs and Veterans Services
 
00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
you can see that we did provide some
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
more General funds there but it also
 
00:32:03.769 --> 00:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
helps leverage as much as 200 million
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
dollars in federal funds so this area
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
they take care of our veterans cemetery
 
00:32:12.049 --> 00:32:12.059 align:start position:0%
maintain facilities throughout the state
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
and going down to the next bullet we
 
00:32:21.529 --> 00:32:21.539 align:start position:0%
also included there's a house bill 330
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
some incentives to try to attract former
 
00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
going to the Department of Agriculture
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
markets and food
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
we've added a position to work with the
 
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
soil conservation committee
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
be going on to page 10. we've included
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
language from House Bill 230
 
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
to develop a uh an electronic licensing
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
system this system dates back to
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know we were told almost the
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
19th century but so we're trying to get
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture back on a
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
firm footing as far as their electronic
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
monitoring and tracking this was another
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
bill that came to us from the Edna
 
00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:12.659 align:start position:0%
committee which I'm sorry the
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee on
 
00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:18.059 align:start position:0%
a unanimous vote
 
00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:21.419 align:start position:0%
going to the Department of Justice we
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
heard that elderly fraud abuse is
 
00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:27.059 align:start position:0%
rampant in the state it's going up more
 
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
and more
 
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
we added another fraud investigating
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
attorney to this office this was an
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
additional request from the Department
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
of Justice to try to deal with the ever
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
increasing problems of elderly Fraud and
 
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.690 align:start position:0%
increasing problems of elderly Fraud and
Abuse

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
Abuse
 
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
all of you have heard about some of the
 
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
issues around the youth development
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
Center in Manchester and elsewhere we've
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
added additional funds to help the
 
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice deal with the
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
increased investigation work required to
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
deal with that issue
 
00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:06.419 align:start position:0%
going down to the bottom of Justice
 
00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:08.099 align:start position:0%
adding additional victim witness
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
specialist position again to help
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
with the anticipated increase from
 
00:34:16.609 --> 00:34:16.619 align:start position:0%
Advocate workloads with the elderly of
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
so the Liquor Commission again Liquor
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
Commission is primarily funded with
 
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
liquor revenues and not General funds
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
very rarely their General funds find
 
00:34:31.129 --> 00:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
their way in that direction but we did
 
00:34:33.169 --> 00:34:33.179 align:start position:0%
approve some of the liquor commission's
 
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
requests for the updated Community
 
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:38.220 align:start position:0%
computer system the next-gen sales
 
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
system and funding additional PC
 
00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:45.419 align:start position:0%
software and Hardware to help their
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
stores operate there's 66 stores operate
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
going to page 11
 
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
again another incentive program trying
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
to keep our employees with us so we
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
added language giving the Liquor
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
Commission authority to enact an
 
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
incentive program to try to keep their
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
employees and attract employees
 
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
the department of energy we've left that
 
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
fairly untouched except we did give the
 
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
Office of Consumer Advocate authority to
 
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
transfer up to 75 thousand dollars for
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
litigation and contract Consultants
 
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:31.820 align:start position:0%
you'll see a large
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
section dedicated to the Department of
 
00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:38.339 align:start position:0%
Corrections we fully funded the
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections requests and
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see that we added some additional
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
things like replacement of computers
 
00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:47.900 align:start position:0%
some upgrading technology infrastructure
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
we also gave them further authorities to
 
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
transfer my uh funds should they be
 
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
necessary in that transfer would require
 
00:35:59.329 --> 00:35:59.339 align:start position:0%
the approval of the joint legislative
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
okay going to page 12.
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised representative cordelli
 
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
hasn't had a question I was just waiting
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
for one of yours but
 
00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
so going to the judicial Council
 
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
we did what often people referred to as
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
truth and budgeting
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we've let this we haven't
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
fully funded the judicial Council
 
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
because they're another agency that can
 
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:32.579 align:start position:0%
come to fiscal if they need additional
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
help in funding their operation we fully
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
funded their requests so hopefully they
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
won't need to come to fiscal but again
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
we fully funded their requests
 
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
going to the Department of Business and
 
00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs this was another area
 
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
that some of you have expressed concern
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
about this was invest New Hampshire we
 
00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:57.740 align:start position:0%
did modify this a little bit making
 
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
allowing municipalities to seek such
 
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
funding for construction or towards
 
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing the original request
 
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
was 30 million dollars this was funded
 
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
all with federal funds in the past this
 
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
is a new general fund item
 
00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
but we kept as you can see here 15
 
00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:19.859 align:start position:0%
million dollars in that line versus the
 
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
authority and as I pointed out earlier
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
we had to cut somewhere and it was
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
difficult to meet all these additional
 
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
asks and fund all the programs to a
 
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
hundred percent so we did take some
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
money here
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
that was in the governor's budget
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
so the Department of Natural and
 
00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
cultural resources below that there was
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
a request from the State library due to
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
the condition of their facilities trying
 
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
to protect their artifacts and books
 
00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
they asked for an additional one million
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
and below that you'll see the there was
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
a request for five hundred thousand
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
dollars to establish the Christa
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
McAuliffe Memorial in a committee to
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
raise funds we reduced that amount to
 
00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:11.780 align:start position:0%
one hundred thousand dollars and again
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
with the language we adopted it prevents
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
nobody from providing gifts or other
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
matching money to help that get off the
 
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.690 align:start position:0%
matching money to help that get off the
ground

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
this is something we often see the very
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
first bullet fully funding the
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture I must be
 
00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
getting tired I almost said agriculture
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
but uh so this is the Department of
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and that's a 27
 
00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
million dollar Grant to fund ongoing
 
00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water Pollution projects some
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
of the folks in finance have referred to
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
this as Buco bucks in the past because
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative Buco has been behind this
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
effort for the better part of a decade
 
00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
we also provided additional funding to
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of a hundred and twenty
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars we have two landfills
 
00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
in the State uh and there's nobody
 
00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
maintaining them they've either gone
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
bankrupt the owners or whatever but the
 
00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
state still has an obligation to keep an
 
00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:21.500 align:start position:0%
eye on those landfills and to monitor
 
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
their leachate
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh the next bullet down a significant
 
00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:30.500 align:start position:0%
amount of money 2.6 million to the
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee River Basin program these
 
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
are funds raised by this district there
 
00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
are 10 communities in the Lake District
 
00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
they have a wastewater treatment plant
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
that the state runs but they require us
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
to approve any of their programs even
 
00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.099 align:start position:0%
though it is money coming from the 10
 
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
communities and we did approve the
 
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
Department's request for that amount of
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
money to upgrade and take care of some
 
00:39:59.329 --> 00:39:59.339 align:start position:0%
maintenance issues at that wastewater
 
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
treatment plant which I believe is in
 
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.150 align:start position:0%
treatment plant which I believe is in
Franklin

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
Franklin
 
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.569 align:start position:0%
Franklin
[Music]

00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:05.579 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
going down to the next bullet this was
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
another I believe there was a house
 
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
request out there though I didn't note
 
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:18.260 align:start position:0%
this on my but PCB assistance fund
 
00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
this again was something that the
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
department was looking to
 
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
fund as far as investigating and
 
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:34.619 align:start position:0%
now we have House Bill 300
 
00:40:37.849 --> 00:40:37.859 align:start position:0%
and it's an inside joke among the
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
division members that this member was
 
00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
the only one that got everything she
 
00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.550 align:start position:0%
the only one that got everything she
wanted

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:47.339 align:start position:0%
this I don't know if representative evil
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
would like to speak to this
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
representative evil has been working in
 
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
issues of solid waste and food waste and
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
try to reduce the state's
 
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Disposal volumes and the
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
division after a long presentation and a
 
00:41:07.609 --> 00:41:07.619 align:start position:0%
lot of work by representative evil
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
supported House Bill 300 which came out
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the environment and agriculture
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
committee unanimous
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
and going on to House Bill
 
00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.829 align:start position:0%
and going on to House Bill
462

00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
462
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
this was an appropriation a new
 
00:41:23.569 --> 00:41:23.579 align:start position:0%
appropriation of two million dollars to
 
00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
help fund the management fund and also
 
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
they created a new position to try to
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
again limit what we're putting in our
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
landfills and representative evil I
 
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
you know if you did a lot of work on
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
this if you'd like to say anything more
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
yeah sure thank you very much and thanks
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
to the division
 
00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.270 align:start position:0%
to the division
um

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
I guess what I would
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
spread an awful lot about landfill
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
citing and it's certainly a
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
controversial issue this is sort of the
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
other side of the coin where we've been
 
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
working really hard
 
00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:57.770 align:start position:0%
working really hard
um

00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
through various initiatives with the Des
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
and others to try to decrease the amount
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
of waste that's going into the landfills
 
00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:08.060 align:start position:0%
to preserve our capacity
 
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
the food waste issue seemed like a
 
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
really good place to start because 25
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
percent of what goes into our landfills
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
and weight is food waste so we thought
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
we'd start small and and hopefully help
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to receive the food ways
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
to develop in the state so we can do
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
better and then the second initiative is
 
00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:33.260 align:start position:0%
funding the solid waste management fund
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
and that is a loan and Grant fund for
 
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
municipalities and businesses to try to
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
incentivize the development of more
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for for diversion of
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
waste in general and for the first
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
couple of years food waste in particular
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
I went to a selectman's meeting in my
 
00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
district last night and they were
 
00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
thrilled to hear that this may be coming
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
because is they have a lot of things
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
they want to do with their transfer
 
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
station so thank you again
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative evil oh there's
 
00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:07.130 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:10.730 align:start position:0%
a question
[Music]

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.609 --> 00:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
you can use one of the mics down there
 
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
HB 300 was retained in committee why
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
don't we let the normal process go up
 
00:43:26.089 --> 00:43:26.099 align:start position:0%
for the bill rather than stick it into
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
the budget along with a zillion other
 
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:32.750 align:start position:0%
the budget along with a zillion other
things

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
I don't recall that situation but was
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
anybody I don't represent McGuire just
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
just in general when when there's
 
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
Financial aspects to a bill when when we
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
send us a bill that spends money we have
 
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
to account for it so the way we account
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
for it is we either we put it in the
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
budget and then we match it against
 
00:43:59.329 --> 00:43:59.339 align:start position:0%
revenue and so and sometimes we don't
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
fully fund it or we change the funding a
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
little bit or whatever but but by we
 
00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:07.859 align:start position:0%
can't really very easily just pass
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
spending bills outside of the budget
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
because then our our finances are not
 
00:44:14.809 --> 00:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
balanced I think representative
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
Harrington said he thought I was
 
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
retained in committee right well that's
 
00:44:19.849 --> 00:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
what I just looked on the internet it
 
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
says HP 300 was retained in committee so
 
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
if it was retained yes so we're not
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
going to spend any money so why do we
 
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
have to stick it in the budget now why
 
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:29.220 align:start position:0%
don't the committee process come out
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
with it and see what we'll do next year
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
no when we put it as part of House Bill
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
2 then we retain it right so that it's
 
00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
it's not in two places at once yeah I
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
believe representative Harrington it
 
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
came out of the environment and
 
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee with the unanimous
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
vote and passed and then we will retain
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
it in our division if we're going to act
 
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
or fund it or maybe we need in finance
 
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
right exactly right that clarifies my
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
all right so moving on
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
down to the last or almost last bullet
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
point we have pfas we work with a
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative two from Merrimack where
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
this has been a significant problem and
 
00:45:15.609 --> 00:45:15.619 align:start position:0%
we changed the
 
00:45:20.809 --> 00:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund to a response fund so to act
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
more quickly and try to deal with pfas
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
contamination there was 25 million
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
dollars put in there in the last budget
 
00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
there's about 12 million dollars left we
 
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
did not add any additional money but we
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
did change some of the language
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
then going down to the last bullet house
 
00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:42.500 align:start position:0%
built 276
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria so I didn't know what that
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
was but that's Lake plumes if any of you
 
00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:50.579 align:start position:0%
know algae plumes that you may see in
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
the ocean or lakes so
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
we did include some uh
 
00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
funding there there's a real problem we
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
got a lot of support
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
for that particular program from a
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
number of different Lake Associations in
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
the state where plumes are becoming an
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
annual problem and affecting tourism in
 
00:46:11.089 --> 00:46:11.099 align:start position:0%
a representative McGuire wants to add
 
00:46:11.099 --> 00:46:13.430 align:start position:0%
a representative McGuire wants to add
something

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
so then going to oh you want to speak on
 
00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
so going to page 14 just a couple of
 
00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
little bullet points again about what I
 
00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:31.220 align:start position:0%
just mentioned on the
 
00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:35.099 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria mitigation program so
 
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
no questions
 
00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:40.309 align:start position:0%
no questions
I

00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
there is something I'd like to add and
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll jinx myself but in all the
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
budgets that those of us that have been
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
on finance for a long time have a scene
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
we get inundated with letters phone
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
calls emails about the horrible things
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
I think most of us average just a couple
 
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
every day when this particular site I
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
think that spoke well for the
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisanship that existed and again I
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank my colleagues on division one for
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
making it quite an easy process and
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire guess would like
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
to have a word or two
 
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:32.109 align:start position:0%
 
rophone

00:47:32.109 --> 00:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
my question was there a language about
 
00:47:39.849 --> 00:47:39.859 align:start position:0%
another bacteria right at the end of
 
00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:42.500 align:start position:0%
myobacteria or something
 
00:47:46.609 --> 00:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
in this in the cyanobacteria clause
 
00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
uh right at the end
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
did you add included a different
 
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
bacteria eligible for that I don't
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
recall that we could get that answer to
 
00:47:59.690 --> 00:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
you it's something that doesn't maybe
 
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:02.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
it was I don't know whether it was a
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
typo or whether you added another
 
00:48:11.569 --> 00:48:11.579 align:start position:0%
uh something else eligible for those
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
same loans
 
00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we would call but we
 
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
could check on that for you I don't
 
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
think we made any changes to the bill as
 
00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman except in the
 
00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:28.140 align:start position:0%
financial area right at least in
 
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
myobacteria or something like that
 
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr chairman so I
 
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
just wanted to admit
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
two big themes of this section of the
 
00:48:39.839 --> 00:48:40.670 align:start position:0%
two big themes of this section of the
budget

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:43.460 align:start position:0%
one is that
 
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
we're state government is having a hard
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
time hiring we are we are
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
um we're short-handed just like you know
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
every other employer is but but in
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
general State Employers in state
 
00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
government regardless of department they
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
have a lot of positions available and
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
nobody to fill them so we did two things
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
about that in this division number one
 
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
is the pay raise right so the pay raise
 
00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
should help us fill some of these
 
00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:19.460 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions the other is
 
00:49:23.569 --> 00:49:23.579 align:start position:0%
technology we essentially acceded to
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
almost every request for new computer
 
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
systems there's there's new computer
 
00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:31.220 align:start position:0%
systems going on in liquor
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
d-a-s-d-r-a and others Department of
 
00:49:37.609 --> 00:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
Agriculture all of that should help them
 
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
with productivity and and help them
 
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
overcome I'm not having enough people
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
and the second theme Here is in our our
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
biggest department is the Department of
 
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
Corrections and they're also the in the
 
00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:56.780 align:start position:0%
most Dire Straits as far as hiring goes
 
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
they have right now only about half as
 
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
many Corrections Officers as they need
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
to run our prisons the the officers we
 
00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
have are working 60 plus 65 hours a week
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
they're required to do that kind of
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
overtime in addition to that parole
 
00:50:20.329 --> 00:50:20.339 align:start position:0%
officers are coming in and working in
 
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
the prisons several shifts a week
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
National Guard members are working in
 
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
the prison and so on it's a very
 
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
difficult situation and so in general we
 
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
gave the department of corrections as
 
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
much support as we could but with one
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
exception the governor had in the budget
 
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars to start construction
 
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
of a new Men's prison there's also 10
 
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars for design but 40
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
million for construction it's estimated
 
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
that the construction of a new Men's
 
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
prison would be a 400 million dollar
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
item very expensive and so we were not
 
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
we took out the 40 million because we're
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
not willing to fund a design until we
 
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
know what it is right there was some
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
criticism over the design of the women's
 
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
prison and so we didn't want that
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
situation to happen again so we gave
 
00:51:17.089 --> 00:51:17.099 align:start position:0%
them support for operations but not for
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
will now recognize chairman of division
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
two represent emmericht to brief on The
 
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:32.099 align:start position:0%
Division II budget
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start out by revisiting the
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
educational trust fund
 
00:51:41.329 --> 00:51:41.339 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of emails coming
 
00:51:42.849 --> 00:51:42.859 align:start position:0%
in about
 
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
it's been eliminated it has not been
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
eliminated it has been redefined as to
 
00:51:50.089 --> 00:51:50.099 align:start position:0%
what it was designed for
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
initially as as the chair said it was
 
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
set up to solve a legal problem so we
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
had a fund and the court was happy
 
00:52:03.049 --> 00:52:03.059 align:start position:0%
several feeders fed cash into that trust
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
fund by in the RSA the lottery is the
 
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
only one specified but a lot of other
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
income was bled into that trust fund
 
00:52:16.849 --> 00:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
the Catch-22 of the trust fund is it
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
could only be spent spent on education
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
so we had this fund this building and
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
the only thing it could be spent on was
 
00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.470 align:start position:0%
the only thing it could be spent on was
education

00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:52:29.329 --> 00:52:29.339 align:start position:0%
all was well and good
 
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
when I first went on finance about nine
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
there were 220 000 students
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
today the estimate is between 155 and
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
160 000.
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
so over nine years you can see that's a
 
00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.650 align:start position:0%
so over nine years you can see that's a
lot

00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
however the con those contributing to
 
00:52:54.049 --> 00:52:54.059 align:start position:0%
the trust fund continue to contribute to
 
00:52:55.849 --> 00:52:55.859 align:start position:0%
the trust fund here comes the money here
 
00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
comes the money here comes the money but
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's fewer and fewer students
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
so there's less and less adequacy to go
 
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
to those students so what happens to the
 
00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.270 align:start position:0%
to those students so what happens to the
money

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
it stays in the trust fund what can you
 
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
spend it on education only
 
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
well about 2011 it was a tough budget
 
00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:15.710 align:start position:0%
well about 2011 it was a tough budget
year

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
and so the
 
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:18.549 align:start position:0%
and so the
the

00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
started looking pretty good because it
 
00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
had 150 180 million dollars
 
00:53:28.569 --> 00:53:28.579 align:start position:0%
only we were spending for building Aid
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh 50 million dollars 40 million dollars
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
out of general fund
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
and somebody said hey why don't we put
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
the building Aid in the trust fund voila
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
problem solved
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
this has gone on now for several years
 
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
and so the trust fund has about 14 or 15
 
00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
items that it regularly pays for
 
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
13 12 or 13 of which used to be paid out
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
of General funds
 
00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
well the chairman decided we got to get
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
it back like it was because as he
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
indicated earlier it had become the
 
00:54:05.089 --> 00:54:05.099 align:start position:0%
education plus fund
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
so there was a
 
00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
Amendment passed that kind of reordered
 
00:54:14.089 --> 00:54:14.099 align:start position:0%
things and took some things out of the
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
trust fund put them back in general
 
00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:16.609 align:start position:0%
trust fund put them back in general
funds

00:54:16.609 --> 00:54:16.619 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
everything got paid for everything I
 
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
mean it didn't take anything from
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
anybody it just kind of redefined what
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
the trust fund is all about
 
00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
now the biggest the purpose of the trust
 
00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
fund was adequacy and if you go to page
 
00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:32.210 align:start position:0%
fund was adequacy and if you go to page
15

00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
15
 
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
you'll see that we actually increase the
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
and we went along with it increased uh
 
00:54:43.609 --> 00:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
adequacy payments by 158 million
 
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
so we're well over a billion dollars
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
right now in education support
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
so nobody got hurt
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
we're doing fine we just did some
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
accounting adjustments
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
the other thing
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
is the the charter schools got fully
 
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.430 align:start position:0%
is the the charter schools got fully
funded

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
building Aid everybody hears about
 
00:55:08.329 --> 00:55:08.339 align:start position:0%
building Aid and we always hear about
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
the tail oh we got to paint the tail
 
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
well what the tale is is well 15 years
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
ago 20 years ago give or take
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
when the state was helping local
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
school districts build buildings it
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
participated in the debt
 
00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
so the state every year participated in
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
a little bit of debt here a little bit
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
of debt there and pretty soon the state
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
had a lot of debt we're participating in
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
over 20 25 year period
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's the tail that's what we're paying
 
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
off right now
 
00:55:43.849 --> 00:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
approximately 50 million dollars a year
 
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
that goes into building Aid
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
about half right now pays for the tail
 
00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
next buying them it'll be 20 of it will
 
00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
be the tail and not 25 so the tail is
 
00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
slowly getting paid off
 
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
but as of today there are 17
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
school districts applying for building
 
00:56:04.559 --> 00:56:05.630 align:start position:0%
school districts applying for building
Aid

00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
Aid
 
00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
of those using the new system we don't
 
00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
we're not doing the old system we'll
 
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
record a little bit of debt for a long
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
time the new system the state pays
 
00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
a percentage but it pays it up front in
 
00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
two tranches
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
so we can't have so many schools we're
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
helping because we're giving the school
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
districts more money up front
 
00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
so they have less debt over their life
 
00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:33.059 align:start position:0%
of their note and we get out of out of
 
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
their note business
 
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
of the 17 that that are on the list so
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
we are going to get funded this year as
 
00:56:40.609 --> 00:56:40.619 align:start position:0%
I said
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh if we can find more money
 
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
for building a we'd love to help
 
00:56:47.569 --> 00:56:47.579 align:start position:0%
more building aid but right now as you
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
see it's approximately 100 million
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
dollars over the biennium
 
00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
oh you know if I didn't I didn't think
 
00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
my my oh my goodness
 
00:56:59.930 --> 00:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
I got too busy in the business of the
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
business here let me thank our LBA
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
Mickey Lonergan
 
00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
I had these notes at the bottom of the
 
00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
page and I'm thinking oh my gosh
 
00:57:22.609 --> 00:57:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.809 --> 00:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
representative Bean
 
00:57:29.819 --> 00:57:33.890 align:start position:0%
representative Bean
representative

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:37.849 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:57:37.849 --> 00:57:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:41.089 --> 00:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
on page 16 you'll see an item that looks
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
like it should be part of hb25 the
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
and that's the Sugar River Valley
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
Regional Technical Center typically the
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
technical centers two were done at per
 
00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.370 align:start position:0%
technical centers two were done at per
biennium

00:58:00.370 --> 00:58:00.380 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
however sometime this particular
 
00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:05.220 align:start position:0%
biennium this one didn't make the list
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
so that that is being supported by uh
 
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
the 20 the current Surplus
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
the community college system
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh I was very impressed by the community
 
00:58:19.069 --> 00:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
college system and what they do
 
00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:20.460 align:start position:0%
if you don't know what they do you ought
 
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
to go online and look at some of the
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
things and get involved in one of the
 
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
one of the great programs they have is
 
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
called fast start
 
00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:31.140 align:start position:0%
and that is high school kids can start
 
00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:32.819 align:start position:0%
taking college courses while they're
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
still in high school
 
00:58:34.319 --> 00:58:36.770 align:start position:0%
still in high school
and

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
the high school credit for it at high
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
school and they also got credit for it
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
as call as college credits uh
 
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
quite a few students are participating
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that I learned
 
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
that was stunning to me is you can go to
 
00:58:54.289 --> 00:58:54.299 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire community college
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
system for two years and become a
 
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
registered nurse
 
00:58:59.930 --> 00:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
you don't have to go for four years you
 
00:59:02.089 --> 00:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
can go for two years and be an RN
 
00:59:05.329 --> 00:59:05.339 align:start position:0%
I was stunned wow what a career
 
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity in two years
 
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
you got to advertise that folks you got
 
00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
to get the word out
 
00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:12.650 align:start position:0%
to get the word out
the

00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:16.609 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:59:16.609 --> 00:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
well we continue to fund the the promise
 
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
program for those eligible for Pell
 
00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:23.329 align:start position:0%

00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh eight hundred thousand buying for
 
00:59:27.049 --> 00:59:27.059 align:start position:0%
math learning
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
Community program
 
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to I'm not going to read
 
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
to you I'm trying to think of it a lot
 
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
of this was very interesting and I could
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
spend all day talking about how
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:45.010 --> 00:59:45.020 align:start position:0%
um the the university system
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
the new Chancellor a very pleasant
 
00:59:48.359 --> 00:59:49.789 align:start position:0%
the new Chancellor a very pleasant
gentleman

00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
gentleman
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
and our old State Treasurer who's now
 
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
the CFO that make quite a team I can
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
tell you that
 
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
one of the items that has some
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
controversy around it is the six million
 
01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
dollars to support the re
 
01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
vampire updating of the Whittemore
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
Center Arena
 
01:00:10.609 --> 01:00:10.619 align:start position:0%
as you can see it's spelled out this is
 
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
actually a 30 million dollar project
 
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
they came to the to the state to say we
 
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
need to show our alumni that you support
 
01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.210 align:start position:0%
need to show our alumni that you support
us

01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:20.220 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
and originally they asked for 8 million
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
after we had a little conversation they
 
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
decided 6 million was sufficient to get
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
the participation of the alumni and the
 
01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:32.900 align:start position:0%
uh other donors
 
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
so we had some very dramatic
 
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh demonstration visual demonstrations
 
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
of what other schools look like compared
 
01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:45.299 align:start position:0%
to our state school and it was it was
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
quite striking so we did support the Six
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
Million Dollars
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
and we're almost back where we were back
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
in 2010 of uh 200 million dollars for
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
the biennium we're very close
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
cities and towns are going to get their
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
block grants
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
of 12 percent
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
High the highway betterment fund is is
 
01:01:15.119 --> 01:01:17.990 align:start position:0%
High the highway betterment fund is is
funded

01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
funded
 
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.250 align:start position:0%
funded
um

01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:21.049 --> 01:01:21.059 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think
 
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
I got to say the Department of
 
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
Transportation at that particular time
 
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
and the budgeting process was plowing
 
01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:27.770 align:start position:0%
and the budgeting process was plowing
snow

01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
snow
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
and so their their minds were otherwise
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
diverted because that that's a big
 
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
expense to them
 
01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:35.990 align:start position:0%
expense to them
so

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
nothing jumps off the page as far as the
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety
 
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
one of the interesting things which was
 
01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier is they they have a
 
01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:50.579 align:start position:0%
staffing problem
 
01:01:53.809 --> 01:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
they're running about 15 to 20 percent
 
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
fewer officers
 
01:01:59.030 --> 01:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
and the primary reason is municipalities
 
01:02:02.089 --> 01:02:02.099 align:start position:0%
are very willing to pay more
 
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
so we're Hiring Our Own State Police
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
into our municipalities and sogo's life
 
01:02:09.289 --> 01:02:09.299 align:start position:0%
in the big city
 
01:02:09.299 --> 01:02:13.970 align:start position:0%
in the big city
uh

01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
three additional instructors paid for
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
the fire fund
 
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
and we also they're going to get 52 new
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
we have we had to kick in a little bit
 
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
for fish and game because their revenues
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
are going down covid is over
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
during covid their revenues shot through
 
01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
the roof
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
because everybody was outside fishing
 
01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
and hunting
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
now the revenues are starting to drop a
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
little bit because
 
01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
we don't have to go outside anymore
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission is self-funding they
 
01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
are adding a
 
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
customer database system that comes out
 
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
of their expenses police standards and
 
01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.370 align:start position:0%
of their expenses police standards and
training

01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
is still supported as they're doing the
 
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.750 align:start position:0%
is still supported as they're doing the
uh

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
accreditation program around the state
 
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
if anybody has any questions you can ask
 
01:03:15.119 --> 01:03:18.170 align:start position:0%
if anybody has any questions you can ask
Ken

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:23.059 align:start position:0%
chairman Emory
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
questions on the areas that division two
 
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
just briefed on
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
wave your hand or stand up so I can see
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
who wants to ask
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
I always have trouble getting through
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
all these zillions of pages of stuff
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
here so I think I know the answer but I
 
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
want to make sure the Powder Mill Fish
 
01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
Hatchery New Durham is funded so it'll
 
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
meet its new EPA requirement by the end
 
01:03:56.089 --> 01:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
any questions further on on division two
 
01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
hey I can't talk anymore
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
yes if you think this is boring imagine
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
six weeks of staring at this stuff over
 
01:04:06.119 --> 01:04:07.549 align:start position:0%
six weeks of staring at this stuff over
here

01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
representative chairman Jess Edwards for
 
01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
division three briefing which is all
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
about Health and Human Services
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh so thank you Mr chair uh always a
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
pleasure to step up with the
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
introduction that this is really going
 
01:04:27.309 --> 01:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
to be boring uh so I'll I'll start by
 
01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
trying to paint kind of the Strategic
 
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
situation that we find ourselves in as a
 
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
state and therefore is uh division three
 
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
and in support of the Appropriations
 
01:04:41.809 --> 01:04:41.819 align:start position:0%
needed for the Department of Health and
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
Human Services and and through the
 
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and other payer efforts uh to
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
the rest of the state to our entire
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
provider community
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
um we we started with the idea that
 
01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid and other reimbursement
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
rates are just generally too low that if
 
01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
you look at the last 10 years of trend
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
they have they have been a little less
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
each year than the overall rate of
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
inflation so when you take that
 
01:05:20.089 --> 01:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
disparity over a 10-year period we've
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
created quite a gap between what
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimburses which is much less
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
than Medicare much less than the
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
commercial payers and and what the state
 
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
was willing to pay so the governor gave
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
us a wonderful opportunity he and his
 
01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
budget presentations he said it in my
 
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
budget I'm going to give you a 3.1
 
01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
percent rate increase when the demand is
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
clearly more at the 15 percent rate
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
level and he said to us that we are free
 
01:05:56.049 --> 01:05:56.059 align:start position:0%
to try to solve the problem
 
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
so we we did in this budget take a big
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
bite out of that 15 percent ask and
 
01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
we're delivering about 11 percent and we
 
01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
do this knowing that money is not going
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
to solve this problem not entirely
 
01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
we have a severe Workforce shortage
 
01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
there are going to be areas in the
 
01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
system that we could
 
01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
have really strong Rich reimbursement
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
rates and probably still end up with
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
under capacity because we just don't
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
have the human talent to plug into these
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
positions so on one hand we have low
 
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
rates on the other hand we have low
 
01:06:38.569 --> 01:06:38.579 align:start position:0%
numbers of personnel and what we've been
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
asked to do is division three and I
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
think we did a fairly good job of it is
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
to navigate
 
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
now we could kind of optimize how we
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
deployed the resources to sort of
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
minimize the pain to the state
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
this navigation would not have been
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
possible without Mr Ripple of the LBA
 
01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
being there every day every night every
 
01:07:07.849 --> 01:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
weekend willing to give me advice and to
 
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:10.140 align:start position:0%
support everyone on the on the committee
 
01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
that that had questions or requests and
 
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
and and to the committee members my vice
 
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:17.890 align:start position:0%
and and to the committee members my vice
chair

01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:17.900 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:20.579 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney who kept me in
 
01:07:22.609 --> 01:07:22.619 align:start position:0%
Lifesavers the whole time to keep a
 
01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:24.839 align:start position:0%
smile on my face during the meetings and
 
01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
others and then representative erf who
 
01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
uh whose experience this is his third
 
01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
term in a division three uh his number
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
crunching is vital and then
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
representative Hull he was here earlier
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
uh whole is a great one for continuously
 
01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
pushing us to rethink what we've been
 
01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:49.690 align:start position:0%
pushing us to rethink what we've been
doing

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:49.700 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:07:52.089 --> 01:07:52.099 align:start position:0%
our colleagues
 
01:07:56.349 --> 01:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
representative walner nordgren tolerski
 
01:08:01.609 --> 01:08:01.619 align:start position:0%
and Stringham could not be here today I
 
01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:03.289 align:start position:0%
and Stringham could not be here today I
think

01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:03.299 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
what they may be doing is preparing an
 
01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
alternative view to how we could deploy
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
these resources so what I'm going to
 
01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:15.059 align:start position:0%
tell you is the position that came out
 
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
of the finance committee it came out of
 
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
the finance committee on unfortunately
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
what I would consider to be a two two
 
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
partisan of a vote and so on Thursday I
 
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
you're gonna you're gonna hear a lot of
 
01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
debate back and forth I'm this is one
 
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
view of what you're going to hear and
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
and I hope you pay attention on Thursday
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
because there's going to be a lot of
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
important decisions to make so to start
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
with the Medicaid reimbursement rate we
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
took the governor's 3.1 percent the
 
01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
hospital said that they would forego
 
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
their share of it if we gave that money
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
to other providers because their biggest
 
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
issue is they are stuck in what we call
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
an ER boarding situation
 
01:09:08.809 --> 01:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you've heard of the
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
ER boarding situation please I just want
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
to I don't want to dumb this down too
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
much but it's really important for
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
people to know
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
what what has happened is that we have
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
patients that go to the ER that didn't
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
get care to begin with in their
 
01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
community that they could have gotten
 
01:09:29.329 --> 01:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
they show up at an ER when they're at
 
01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
the emergency room er
 
01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
um they get diagnosed as being a danger
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
to themselves or to others so they are
 
01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.669 align:start position:0%
to themselves or to others so they are
involuntarily

01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
involuntarily
 
01:09:40.679 --> 01:09:42.010 align:start position:0%
involuntarily
capped

01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:42.020 align:start position:0%
capped
 
01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:44.550 align:start position:0%
in the ER getting
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:46.090 align:start position:0%
in the ER getting
[Music]

01:09:46.090 --> 01:09:46.100 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
holding down a bed holding down staff
 
01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
attention but being in a
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
non-reimbursable status because the
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
hospital can't give them the care that
 
01:09:57.530 --> 01:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
they require so the so the hospitals are
 
01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:00.380 align:start position:0%
just basically warehousing these people
 
01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's just barbaric this is not the way a
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
great nation treats its patients it's
 
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
not a way a great state treats its
 
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
patients the ERS know this they want to
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
discharge these people but they have no
 
01:10:13.199 --> 01:10:14.930 align:start position:0%
discharge these people but they have no
capacity

01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
in the community to discharge patients
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
into so our priority with the the
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
targeted rate increases above the 3.1
 
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
percent the governor allocated was to
 
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
try to solve first the problem of giving
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
the capacity the ERS needed so that
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
patients could could move through the
 
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
the clinical workflow and then after
 
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
trying to address that as much as we had
 
01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
the resources for we want to the front
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
end and tried to address some of the
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
issues with making sure that there are
 
01:10:51.649 --> 01:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
some Community Care Resources in advance
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the need so that they don't go to the
 
01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
ER in the first place but this problem
 
01:10:58.970 --> 01:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
of housing people in the emergency room
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
is is should truly be unacceptable to
 
01:11:05.209 --> 01:11:05.219 align:start position:0%
all of us and unfortunately there's not
 
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
an optimization formula to tell us
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
exactly how much money we should be
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
putting into this so so we've taken and
 
01:11:15.169 --> 01:11:15.179 align:start position:0%
given it our best shot
 
01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
we uh we we started with the 12 million
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
for the 3.1 percent we added another 70
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
million uh in general funds all of that
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
gets matched by federal Medicaid money
 
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
so it's the impact is is is it like at
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
least double those numbers on our health
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
care System
 
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
um as a result because we gave different
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
amounts to different targets in general
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
it feels like in about an 11
 
01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
increase in Medicaid rate hikes for the
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
non-hospital providers
 
01:11:51.649 --> 01:11:51.659 align:start position:0%
so that's substantial but they had asked
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
for 15 percent and probably could have
 
01:11:56.689 --> 01:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
Justified it we had asked the governor
 
01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
starting back in August or so early in
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
the budget process to identify Bill
 
01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
payers for us
 
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
we knew that the the the Medicaid rates
 
01:12:09.649 --> 01:12:09.659 align:start position:0%
were going to be uh too low we knew that
 
01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
we had this state
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
um uh salary increase coming so the
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
request was please Identify some Bill
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
payers for us so that this isn't all new
 
01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
spending and
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
um and so uh what we ended up going with
 
01:12:28.669 --> 01:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
is a continuation of what's called a
 
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
back of the budget uh general fund
 
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
reduction what we do is we ask like we
 
01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
did in the current term that they force
 
01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
their spending such that they can lapse
 
01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
back to us 23.4 million dollars at the
 
01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:47.540 align:start position:0%
end of the term
 
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
23.4 million sounds problematic to a lot
 
01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
of people but but I don't think it is
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's we it's non-inflation-adjusted it's
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
the amount that they've got now we wrote
 
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
more flexibility into the legislation so
 
01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
that they can do a better job of
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
managing funds between accounts
 
01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
and they they've done the current year
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
at the 23.4 million that's about 1.1
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
percent of all of the general funds this
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
is if you've ever been in the corporate
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
world you know that at any given budget
 
01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
year you can be asked to cut 10 percent
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
across the board so we're just asking
 
01:13:30.649 --> 01:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
them to manage 1.1 percent uh give back
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
of what we're budgeting for them
 
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
um also we we continue the ceiling of
 
01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
three thousand on the filled full-time
 
01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
authorized position that kept us from
 
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
having to add
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
money to the budget that they couldn't
 
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
spend probably anyways because the
 
01:13:51.169 --> 01:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
workforce isn't there so so that back of
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
the budget uh reduction to me is just
 
01:13:58.010 --> 01:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
recognizes the reality of the situation
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
moving on to the office of the
 
01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
commissioner there's something called
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
the prescription drug affordability
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
board if you're in Commerce you've heard
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
it if you've been if you've been in
 
01:14:09.610 --> 01:14:09.620 align:start position:0%
division three you've heard about it
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
what this entity is is uh got initiated
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
a couple of terms ago and it turned out
 
01:14:19.149 --> 01:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
that we created the most powerful
 
01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
autonomous entity in New Hampshire it
 
01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
has under current law the authority to
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
tax to regulate and to enforce their
 
01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
regulation without it really being
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
responsive or accountable to anyone so
 
01:14:38.209 --> 01:14:38.219 align:start position:0%
so this is the definition of a poor
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
government design so we have an
 
01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
amendment in there that basically says
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
instead of them being able to Levy taxes
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
on their own we're going to fund them
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
with General funds we're going to take a
 
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
look at the powers that they were given
 
01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
to see if there's redundancy in their
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
efforts and we're going to eliminate the
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
ability their ability to issue their own
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
civil fines if they ask a company for
 
01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
data and the company doesn't provide the
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
data currently that organization has the
 
01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
authority to find them up to twenty five
 
01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per incident
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
without any oversight by any other
 
01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.729 align:start position:0%
without any oversight by any other
department

01:15:18.729 --> 01:15:18.739 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
on the next page we allow the health
 
01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
care facility workplace violence
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
prevention act to go into effect on
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
schedule the hiccup here is that when we
 
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
establish this act last term there
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
wasn't a fiscal note attached to it and
 
01:15:38.209 --> 01:15:38.219 align:start position:0%
then for some reason in the budget
 
01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
process even though it was law it didn't
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
ever get budgeted so DHHS came back
 
01:15:45.610 --> 01:15:45.620 align:start position:0%
asking us to
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
hold in forbearance their obligation to
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
expend Manpower on things like rule
 
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
making and so rather than suspend the
 
01:15:57.890 --> 01:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
whole program as requested we just
 
01:16:01.729 --> 01:16:01.739 align:start position:0%
suspended the obligation of the state to
 
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
to do its part and because the private
 
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
sector can can handle this actually
 
01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
better without us I think and they'll
 
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
figure that out in the next couple years
 
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
with this amendment
 
01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
um we spend a lot of money on
 
01:16:19.570 --> 01:16:19.580 align:start position:0%
Information Systems to try to buy I.T
 
01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
productivity and the big one is the
 
01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
Medicaid management information system
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
where we're spending 20.5 million
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
dollars and that's being met with a 65
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
million dollar match by the federal
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
government that's all for operations and
 
01:16:37.689 --> 01:16:37.699 align:start position:0%
maintenance this is an incredibly
 
01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
expensive system we it had been in hb2
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
we moved it into hb1 so for those of you
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
who are following the knits and the
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
noise going why is division three asking
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
for more money than the governor did it
 
01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
part of the reason is because there are
 
01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
a couple of these items that were in hp2
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to put into HP one for
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
a big one big policy issue is we added
 
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh the granite Advantage Program the
 
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion program into the
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
budget and some people have said well
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
why are you doing that even I mean we
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
got the Senate bill that that passed I
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
don't know I think it was 22 to two it
 
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
was a landslide whatever it was and it's
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
coming over to us why don't we just deal
 
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
with that bill and not put this into hp2
 
01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:31.940 align:start position:0%
well we're putting it into hb2 because
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
currently the federal government is
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
paying a 90 percent match
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
a 90 match that that's my that's kind of
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
money you can't turn down
 
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
um but there's no long-term guarantee
 
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
that what that match is going to be this
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
this feels a little like you know the
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
old heroin dealer giving you your first
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
couple of hits and then once you get
 
01:17:59.689 --> 01:17:59.699 align:start position:0%
addicted to it they you know start
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
charging you so that's a that's that's
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
kind of an analogy with the federal
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
government on this so we need to have a
 
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
Sunset date so the Sunset date on this
 
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
is two years the Senate says that it
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
should be permanent and so that's
 
01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
something we're going to debate
 
01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
there's an extension of postpartum care
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
for for new moms and babies from 60 days
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
to 12 months that's what's the clinical
 
01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
research suggests is the right amount of
 
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
time to make sure that women have the
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
the mental health counseling and the
 
01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
clinical care beyond the initial two
 
01:18:37.209 --> 01:18:37.219 align:start position:0%
months post-pregnancy we have a waiver
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
that 35 other states have have accepted
 
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
that basically says for those women and
 
01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
children who are in the United States
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
lawfully that those otherwise eligible
 
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
women can be able to get expanded care
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
through the chip program and and other
 
01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.450 align:start position:0%
through the chip program and and other
services

01:18:59.450 --> 01:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
by waving a five-year requirement for
 
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
those of you who know the immigration
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
system generally for legal immigrants we
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
say that there's a five-year period that
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
you have to be in the nation before you
 
01:19:14.770 --> 01:19:14.780 align:start position:0%
can uh are eligible for care or for uh
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
benefits and so so we waive that for the
 
01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
health care component here all of this
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
under the Medicaid we fully funded the
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended levels
 
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
plus some we we we enhanced a little bit
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
the division of Human Services
 
01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
we we took representative walner's idea
 
01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
there is federal money called temporary
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
assistance to needy families TANF and it
 
01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
builds up year over year into an account
 
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
and we had about 67 million dollars in
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
it and she had you know two or three
 
01:19:56.689 --> 01:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
items in here that seemed to be good
 
01:19:59.810 --> 01:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
Investments to help support
 
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
our Workforce Development by allowing
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
the child care services to hire to so
 
01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
they have the capacity to reduce wait
 
01:20:10.850 --> 01:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
lists and then we increase the
 
01:20:13.970 --> 01:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
eligibility thresholds so that more
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
people would be eligible the two that
 
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
you see there the 85 percent of median
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
income is essentially the same 300
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
percent family poverty level that we've
 
01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:27.260 align:start position:0%
seen in other legislation but we kept it
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
as a percent of State medium income
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
because that matches federal law better
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
same with the next page on the 75th
 
01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.810 align:start position:0%
same with the next page on the 75th
percentile

01:20:37.810 --> 01:20:37.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
we added back into fb1 this is another
 
01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
reason our house bill one is bigger than
 
01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
the governors is we took money that for
 
01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
the sununu center continuing operations
 
01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
and put it into hb1 so that there would
 
01:20:56.770 --> 01:20:56.780 align:start position:0%
be transparency and continuity
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
one of the things we heard that I'm very
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
proud of division three is we heard for
 
01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
the very first time that we were still
 
01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.990 align:start position:0%
the very first time that we were still
subjecting

01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
subjecting
 
01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
juveniles to a strip search when they
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
came in and given that we're trying to
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
obtain a trauma-informed therapeutic
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
based delivery system in the in that
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
Health Care setting
 
01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
saying hello take your clothes off so I
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
can strip search you is just not a great
 
01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
way to start that Health Care
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
consultation so so out of the budget
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
that they asked for we reduced it by a
 
01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
couple million dollars over the biennium
 
01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
and they agreed if we gave them
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
flexibility on moving money around
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
within their accounts that they would go
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
ahead and acquire a full body scanner so
 
01:21:49.010 --> 01:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
that the so that the strip search is no
 
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
longer required I I just think that's
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
good compassionate reallocation of
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
scarce resources
 
01:21:58.729 --> 01:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
the next item under elderly and Adult
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
Services this is something you should go
 
01:22:03.490 --> 01:22:03.500 align:start position:0%
talk and brag about to your counties
 
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
because this is the continuation of what
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
we established in the current budget we
 
01:22:12.169 --> 01:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
added more State money to what's called
 
01:22:15.729 --> 01:22:15.739 align:start position:0%
a county cap system to where
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
in Rockingham County I was told because
 
01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
of the additional money that we provided
 
01:22:26.689 --> 01:22:26.699 align:start position:0%
the CFO said that that allowed him to
 
01:22:29.689 --> 01:22:29.699 align:start position:0%
reduce the request for property tax
 
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
increases at the county level by seven
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
percentage points I don't know that's
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
that's real property tax relief it's
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
kind of hidden deep in the budget but
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
you should be aware of it and and be be
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
glad about it
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
our support at the state level for
 
01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
developmental Services is sort of
 
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
interesting we're obli we obligated
 
01:22:55.729 --> 01:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
ourselves by law to fully fund
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
the DD Community such that
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
there were no Financial obstacles
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
to to have a zero wait list
 
01:23:10.669 --> 01:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
now the problem with having this goes
 
01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
back to what I was saying earlier you
 
01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
can throw money at a problem and we have
 
01:23:17.689 --> 01:23:17.699 align:start position:0%
required by law we fully funded it but
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
there just isn't the capacity in the
 
01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:22.940 align:start position:0%
system to actually provide the services
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that uh that
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative erf did that I thought
 
01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
was was kind of brilliant is he he
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
recognized that as we approach the end
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
of this term we probably had money that
 
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
we had previously obligated for the DD
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
wait list that could not possibly be
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
spent and so we're taking the amount
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
that couldn't possibly be spent and
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
we're moving it into the next year to
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
reduce the next budget's demands
 
01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:54.649 align:start position:0%
reduce the next budget's demands
um

01:23:54.649 --> 01:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorders got additional
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
funding at the governor's request these
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
are pretty substantial
 
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
um and I I don't recall the source of
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
these acquired brain disorder Services I
 
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
know I know from my military experience
 
01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:10.940 align:start position:0%
just being around
 
01:24:14.649 --> 01:24:14.659 align:start position:0%
explosions and other things can create
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
brain disorders that need treatment
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's a fairly expensive line item
 
01:24:24.649 --> 01:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
couple line items and and I I and
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
because it grows so fast I'm going to
 
01:24:30.169 --> 01:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
ask in my capacity on Health and Human
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
Services or excuse me HHS oversight for
 
01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
us to get periodic reviews on how that
 
01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
money is being spent we didn't have time
 
01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
in division three to really drill into
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
it the way that we could
 
01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
on the next page 23 go ahead there's a
 
01:24:47.169 --> 01:24:47.179 align:start position:0%
question somewhere we have a question
 
01:24:50.530 --> 01:24:50.540 align:start position:0%
why is it that those two line items not
 
01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
combined it's a duplicate so why isn't
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
the the you know 92.4 million added in
 
01:24:59.930 --> 01:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
with the 17.9 and then the percentage
 
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
change why is it a duplicate line item
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
I believe the last one there is is
 
01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
children versus adults same services but
 
01:25:14.689 --> 01:25:14.699 align:start position:0%
for children
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay so you just didn't note that all
 
01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
any other any other questions thank you
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you uh for the question
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you one over here representing the
 
01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:28.669 align:start position:0%
thank you one over here representing the
whole

01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:25:28.679 --> 01:25:30.410 align:start position:0%
whole
yes

01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
you're in division three are you not I
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
am I was trying to make an additional
 
01:25:37.729 --> 01:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
comment relative to the scanners that
 
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
you talked about earlier in favor what's
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
not we didn't know at first it's not
 
01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
just about coming in the facility it's
 
01:25:46.729 --> 01:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
every time the child goes in and out of
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
the facility which was important right
 
01:25:50.209 --> 01:25:50.219 align:start position:0%
they go to see a parent they go to see
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
an attorney all of those go through that
 
01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:53.689 align:start position:0%
an attorney all of those go through that
same

01:25:53.689 --> 01:25:53.699 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
Right strip search and it's something
 
01:25:57.649 --> 01:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
that should have been implemented years
 
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
ago and it can be relatively easily so
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so I I don't know about you
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
but I I just think uh the scanner made
 
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
sense I mean if we can go through one of
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
these at the airport I mean certainly we
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
could do this for um
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
when these kids are incarcerated on page
 
01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:20.910 align:start position:0%
23 the top of it
 
01:26:20.910 --> 01:26:21.530 align:start position:0%
23 the top of it
[Music]

01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:22.390 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:26.689 --> 01:26:26.699 align:start position:0%
this is funding to fund the New
 
01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire kidney cancer incidents phase
 
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
three feasibility study now I'm I'm not
 
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
a researcher I don't do pfas research
 
01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
but what we heard in testimony pretty
 
01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
clearly is that in order to get to phase
 
01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:42.350 align:start position:0%
clearly is that in order to get to phase
three

01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
would you believe you have to go through
 
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
phase one and phase two
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
and upon completing phase two under
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
particularly narrow criteria then you go
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
to phase three which is an in-depth more
 
01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:59.750 align:start position:0%
to phase three which is an in-depth more
more

01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
defining more detailed analysis of
 
01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
what's going on to correlate the
 
01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
incidence of pfast to the incidence of
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
disease so it's extremely rare to go to
 
01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
phase three and we need to do that in
 
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
one of our communities all of our
 
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
communities are important but we know
 
01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
where Merrimack is located and how it's
 
01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
so close to such a large population
 
01:27:26.810 --> 01:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
centers or population centers so this is
 
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
this is a five hundred thousand dollars
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
to to learn what we don't yet know about
 
01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
the correlation between
 
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
the things in our environment and
 
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
diseases that we're seeing let me
 
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.010 align:start position:0%
diseases that we're seeing let me
interrupt

01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
interrupt
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
this pfast has become such an issue Des
 
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
is setting very low standards for all
 
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
water treatment systems and I question
 
01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
them and say based on what
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
and it's all the studies have been done
 
01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
on rodents
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
how about humans
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
well there hasn't been enough
 
01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
so finally
 
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
we have a population that has been
 
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
affected and we're going to do some
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
human studies and I think it's very
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
important if we're going to spend
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
billions on water treatment facilities
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
without knowing the real effects on
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
humans so to me this was a landmark
 
01:28:19.129 --> 01:28:19.139 align:start position:0%
study and so I think it was very
 
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
important that we fund it so we can find
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
out finally what are the real effects on
 
01:28:25.129 --> 01:28:25.139 align:start position:0%
humans thank you
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:28:27.239 --> 01:28:28.010 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:28:28.010 --> 01:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
we're almost at the end here uh the for
 
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
the division of Behavioral Health you'll
 
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
see that we allocated 7.4 million in
 
01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
general funds this is above the
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
governor's request and and in return we
 
01:28:47.689 --> 01:28:47.699 align:start position:0%
expect 6.6 million in uh matching funds
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
from the federal government that money
 
01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
is going into something that we refer to
 
01:28:55.729 --> 01:28:55.739 align:start position:0%
as a system of care so for those of you
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
who aren't following along closely if
 
01:29:01.129 --> 01:29:01.139 align:start position:0%
you reflect back on what I had said
 
01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
earlier about the ER boarding crisis
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
that what we also in in addition to
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
wanting to have capacity for moving
 
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
people out of the ERS we want to have
 
01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
some Community capability that would
 
01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:19.139 align:start position:0%
intervene and keep it so that you didn't
 
01:29:21.530 --> 01:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
need to send somebody to the ER to begin
 
01:29:24.490 --> 01:29:24.500 align:start position:0%
with we refer to those
 
01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
capabilities those upfront capabilities
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
in large part as a system of care system
 
01:29:32.209 --> 01:29:32.219 align:start position:0%
of care is bigger than that but what
 
01:29:35.090 --> 01:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
this money is intended to do is again to
 
01:29:37.729 --> 01:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
create capacity so that we have fewer
 
01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
people requiring
 
01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
the need to go to the emergency room and
 
01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
this particular money is targeted at the
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
capacity for our children
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
the next bullet down
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's a couple things that you
 
01:29:58.129 --> 01:29:58.139 align:start position:0%
don't see on this sheet but in the
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
aggregate what we wanted to do was we
 
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
wanted to protect the governor's
 
01:30:06.890 --> 01:30:06.900 align:start position:0%
Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs so
 
01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
that we kept a prior legislative promise
 
01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
to fund them at five percent of alcohol
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
sales they've been getting less than
 
01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
five percent and so what we did was we
 
01:30:23.689 --> 01:30:23.699 align:start position:0%
went ahead and and added another 1.1
 
01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
million or so somebody did some math on
 
01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
the projections of the alcohol and we
 
01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
came up with what the revenue number
 
01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:32.820 align:start position:0%
ought to be at five percent but then we
 
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
did something else and I actually think
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
this is more important in a way there
 
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
were two hb2 items that were put into
 
01:30:44.570 --> 01:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
hb2 that earmarked and directed the
 
01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
spending of the commission's money on
 
01:30:51.169 --> 01:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
particular items and so
 
01:30:55.370 --> 01:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
so I thought and I and the majority of
 
01:30:58.490 --> 01:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
division three thought that that was not
 
01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
transparent enough that we shouldn't be
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
taking this independent commission with
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
its own budget process and using it to
 
01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
so that we could go around the back door
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
and earmark funds so we so we killed
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
those two items while protecting the the
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
revenues and my communication to the
 
01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
chair of that uh Patrick Tufts is that
 
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know there's there's so many
 
01:31:26.570 --> 01:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
respected stakeholders on that
 
01:31:28.490 --> 01:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
commission and they have such good
 
01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
budget processes if they want to fund
 
01:31:33.169 --> 01:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
the two things that we pulled out then
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
they they have mechanisms to do that
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
without or spending their money for them
 
01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
we established for the first time that
 
01:31:44.090 --> 01:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
the request to representative tolerski
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
some money to go for a local coalition
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
to help reduce prevent and reduce youth
 
01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
substance use and although her hometown
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
is is a key player in ashua there are
 
01:31:59.629 --> 01:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
five other or there are four other towns
 
01:32:01.490 --> 01:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
rather that are spreading around New
 
01:32:02.930 --> 01:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a little bit to give some
 
01:32:06.250 --> 01:32:06.260 align:start position:0%
geographic distribution of that money
 
01:32:09.890 --> 01:32:09.900 align:start position:0%
and so there was a request for more than
 
01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
that but since this was a first time
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
funding request and there was a some
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
ambiguity around the existence of
 
01:32:21.890 --> 01:32:21.900 align:start position:0%
matching money we we we we took a just a
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
smaller bite at this then we get into
 
01:32:25.930 --> 01:32:25.940 align:start position:0%
the Veterans Home
 
01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
the we basically accepted the proposal
 
01:32:32.689 --> 01:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
we didn't change our proposal other than
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
to give them a little bit more
 
01:32:35.930 --> 01:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
flexibility on moving money within their
 
01:32:39.250 --> 01:32:39.260 align:start position:0%
accounts and they budgeted a census of
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
225 again their their biggest problem
 
01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
isn't the money it's the workforce so
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's a consistent theme throughout
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
this we we I if you ask me what it would
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
take to fully fund our health care
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
delivery system in New Hampshire I
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't possibly tell you because
 
01:33:00.490 --> 01:33:00.500 align:start position:0%
there's there's not enough you know
 
01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
analytical math to figure it all out
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
given the other variables and the
 
01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
biggest one is we don't have the the
 
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
human capacity in the state to do it so
 
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
um so on one hand you want to get the
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
capacity you want to encourage Your
 
01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
Capacity with more money on the other
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
hand you know that there's a point in
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
reality which more money is not the
 
01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
solution of the problem and so it just
 
01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
got to be judgments and and the uh the
 
01:33:31.129 --> 01:33:31.139 align:start position:0%
the the nine members of division three
 
01:33:33.050 --> 01:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
to include the chairman when he's able
 
01:33:35.330 --> 01:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
to sit in we all have our independent
 
01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
judgments and in this budget recognizes
 
01:33:42.110 --> 01:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
our best Collective judgment on meeting
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
the needs for health care in New
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire through the state mechanisms
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
and with our our ability to Resource it
 
01:33:53.209 --> 01:33:53.219 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to take questions if there
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
are any okay we have a question right in
 
01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
front there
 
01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:58.610 align:start position:0%
front there
hi

01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
hi
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
um I respect all that you do this is all
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
so new to me I am a freshman and I know
 
01:34:06.530 --> 01:34:06.540 align:start position:0%
this is an incredible task
 
01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
but I have to say the one thing that I
 
01:34:13.850 --> 01:34:13.860 align:start position:0%
need an answer to Is we are spending two
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty thousand dollars to
 
01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
expand the teacher of the year program
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
but we are spending two hundred thousand
 
01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:23.229 align:start position:0%
but we are spending two hundred thousand
dollars

01:34:23.229 --> 01:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:34:27.649 --> 01:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
for reduced use substance abuse I
 
01:34:29.570 --> 01:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
understand you have to rob Peter to pay
 
01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:30.649 align:start position:0%
understand you have to rob Peter to pay
Paul

01:34:30.649 --> 01:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
Paul
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
I just don't know how to explain that to
 
01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
my constituents do I say I just don't
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
know because I wasn't there
 
01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
but that just kind of slapped me in the
 
01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
face a little and I apologize if I'm
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
offending anybody that is not my intent
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
say again what the 200 000 is your
 
01:34:49.729 --> 01:34:49.739 align:start position:0%
questioning you were spending 200 000
 
01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
for a first time funding for local
 
01:34:54.530 --> 01:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
coalitions to prevent
 
01:34:58.850 --> 01:34:58.860 align:start position:0%
and reduce youth substance abuse
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
and we are spending two hundred and
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars to expand the
 
01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
so so I'm not able to compare and
 
01:35:13.129 --> 01:35:13.139 align:start position:0%
contrast the two programs because I only
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
dealt with the 200 000 for the
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
prevention I know I know I'm just saying
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
I will answer your question to the
 
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
extent that I'm I'm able to and the
 
01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
initial request was 625
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
000 for the five we reduced it to 200
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
000 uh for the five that's forty
 
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars each uh to me it's
 
01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
enough to try five different pilot
 
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
projects to to find if that money can
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
stimulate matching money coming out of
 
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
the community uh and I and I think in
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
theory we all have said before that an
 
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
 
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
cure and I agree 100 sure so if we can
 
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
get in on the front end and prevent and
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
and recover these kids particularly uh
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's going to save us a lot of money
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
down the road I agree 100 percent
 
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
this is sort of an experiment there were
 
01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
there were these five groups that have
 
01:36:12.110 --> 01:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
asked for help
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
they've asked for help on what we all
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
regard as a very serious issue my
 
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
question is I don't question what you
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
did I'm just saying that yes I
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
understand it's going to slap there's
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
there's like 11 000 teachers and and
 
01:36:28.370 --> 01:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
there's also 150 000 students I don't
 
01:36:32.689 --> 01:36:32.699 align:start position:0%
know maybe 20 000 a high school but we
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
have to try to experiment and see if
 
01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
these group groups can make a difference
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
years ago I remember we were giving a
 
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
group uh a million a year to try to cut
 
01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
down on teenage smoking a year or two
 
01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
later we said you haven't you haven't
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
caused any change we're taking the money
 
01:36:54.169 --> 01:36:54.179 align:start position:0%
away the same thing will happen here
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
again if these groups do well we will
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
probably give them more money because
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's a serious problem we all understand
 
01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
I agree it is a horrendous problem
 
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
horrendous problem I'm just saying
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
it just it I question I I know
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to say to me so you're
 
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
spending two hundred thousand to try to
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
prevent use from becoming drug addicts
 
01:37:22.189 --> 01:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
but you're spending 250 000 to expand
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
to expand the teacher of the year
 
01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:25.790 align:start position:0%
to expand the teacher of the year
program

01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
that's going to come to me
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
from the people that I work for
 
01:37:33.169 --> 01:37:33.179 align:start position:0%
I just don't know how to answer that and
 
01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
my answer is going to have to be
 
01:37:38.689 --> 01:37:38.699 align:start position:0%
I'm going to play dumb I'm a freshman I
 
01:37:40.490 --> 01:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
understand there's a lot of robbing
 
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
Peter to pay Paul but I cannot answer
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
that question I just want to show you
 
01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:47.159 align:start position:0%
it's one that stands out to me and it
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
respectfully because I don't understand
 
01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
at all chairman Emerick may have some
 
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
comments the teacher of the year
 
01:37:57.229 --> 01:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
expansion to that 250 000 came to
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
finance in the governor's budget we
 
01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
questioned it and said so what what are
 
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
you going to do I mean
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
the idea was to take the teacher of the
 
01:38:12.770 --> 01:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
year as a as a speaker as a trainer
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
to circulate among teachers
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
and see if they can help the profile
 
01:38:23.570 --> 01:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
part of that is paying the salary of
 
01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
that teacher while they vacate their job
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
which if I was the principal of that
 
01:38:33.110 --> 01:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
school I'd be very upset about right
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
because you're taking my best teacher
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
and the best teacher in the state and
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
send her somewhere else or him but
 
01:38:42.590 --> 01:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
anyway so it's a budget item
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
I don't think they can spend 250 000 but
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
that that's why it's budgeted that way
 
01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a pilot and I can't tell you
 
01:38:53.209 --> 01:38:53.219 align:start position:0%
if it's going to work or not thank you
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
everything we've fund has to deliver or
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
it won't be in the next budget
 
01:38:59.810 --> 01:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
I think you're an accident or she okay
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
over here
 
01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not sorry am I next yep thank you
 
01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I'm Meryl Gibbs
 
01:39:10.729 --> 01:39:10.739 align:start position:0%
I represent conquered word nine
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
um and I have a kind of overall question
 
01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
uh which I tried to hold until the end
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
of the presentation
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
um but first I would like to thank the
 
01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
members of the finance committee for all
 
01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
of your hard work I know how hard it is
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with the budget many years ago I
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
was director of a small state agency and
 
01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
I really do know how hard it is to deal
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
with the budget uh but my question deals
 
01:39:40.129 --> 01:39:40.139 align:start position:0%
with the interests and dividends tax
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
um and uh I'll start out by saying that
 
01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
of course nobody gets pleasure from
 
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
paying taxes
 
01:39:50.330 --> 01:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
um but uh as uh the late Supreme Court
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes is
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
reported to have said taxes are the
 
01:39:58.010 --> 01:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
price we pay for a civilized society
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire has lived with the
 
01:40:03.290 --> 01:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax for a very
 
01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
long time uh it was originally started
 
01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:08.110 align:start position:0%
long time uh it was originally started
in

01:40:08.110 --> 01:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
1923. I actually looked it up on the
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue website
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
and so my question is
 
01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
um rather than repeal it why not keep it
 
01:40:25.490 --> 01:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
and invest the money in those places uh
 
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire where the needs are
 
01:40:30.169 --> 01:40:30.179 align:start position:0%
most urgent and there are many such
 
01:40:32.930 --> 01:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
places but I'll just mention three of
 
01:40:37.090 --> 01:40:37.100 align:start position:0%
them which are what I hear
 
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
and from what I've been reading places
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
that have particularly urgent needs
 
01:40:46.669 --> 01:40:46.679 align:start position:0%
and these are Medicaid
 
01:40:46.679 --> 01:40:48.050 align:start position:0%
and these are Medicaid
uh

01:40:48.050 --> 01:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
uh second is public schools and I guess
 
01:40:54.350 --> 01:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
my question is there why not have
 
01:40:58.490 --> 01:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
Excellence not just adequacy uh and have
 
01:41:01.070 --> 01:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
Excellence everywhere poor towns as well
 
01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
as Rich towns and uh the third being
 
01:41:07.370 --> 01:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
affordable housing so that is a a
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
general and Broad question so I'm not
 
01:41:12.290 --> 01:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
sure who I should address it to but I'm
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
hoping that there's somebody who can
 
01:41:15.290 --> 01:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
give me a little more information on
 
01:41:17.930 --> 01:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire wants to give it
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
a try
 
01:41:23.689 --> 01:41:23.699 align:start position:0%
I'll start with the first half of that
 
01:41:26.090 --> 01:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
which is about taxes
 
01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:26.629 align:start position:0%
which is about taxes
um

01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
in I think and I think many of us do
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
that the interest in dividends tax is
 
01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
the most economically destructive tax we
 
01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
have to the state
 
01:41:41.450 --> 01:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
so when you tax something you you get
 
01:41:44.930 --> 01:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
less of it right and it's it's sometimes
 
01:41:47.570 --> 01:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
that's deliberate we tax cigarettes we
 
01:41:52.129 --> 01:41:52.139 align:start position:0%
tax liquor we tax sins because we want
 
01:41:54.649 --> 01:41:54.659 align:start position:0%
less of them partially and partially we
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
want the revenue but
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
um when what the interests and dividends
 
01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
tax is is its attacks on savings and
 
01:42:03.719 --> 01:42:05.149 align:start position:0%
tax is is its attacks on savings and
investment

01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
and savings and investment is something
 
01:42:10.490 --> 01:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
that we want to encourage and in fact we
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
have spending in the budget to encourage
 
01:42:15.590 --> 01:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
savings and investment we have spending
 
01:42:18.129 --> 01:42:18.139 align:start position:0%
on affordable housing we have a
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Economic Development
 
01:42:23.450 --> 01:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
things like that so on the one hand
 
01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
we're discouraging savings and
 
01:42:28.189 --> 01:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
investment and on the other hand we're
 
01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
trying to encourage it by spending on it
 
01:42:34.490 --> 01:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
if you see what I mean so unlike all of
 
01:42:38.810 --> 01:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
our other taxes this is a direct tax on
 
01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
the future viability of the New
 
01:42:44.090 --> 01:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy savings and investment
 
01:42:47.570 --> 01:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
Capital formation is what makes tomorrow
 
01:42:50.209 --> 01:42:50.219 align:start position:0%
better than today it's it's what makes
 
01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:53.219 align:start position:0%
things grow in the future whereas other
 
01:42:58.129 --> 01:42:58.139 align:start position:0%
kinds of taxes taxes on consumption are
 
01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
it means we consume less today right we
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
have a tax on rooms and meals for
 
01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
example so that means people go to
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
restaurants less than they would
 
01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise right so that's not a
 
01:43:12.050 --> 01:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
destructive tax to the Future it's not a
 
01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
destructive tax to the economy of the
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
state in the same way so so our argument
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
is this is an important tax to get rid
 
01:43:25.129 --> 01:43:25.139 align:start position:0%
of now it's also important just from a
 
01:43:27.890 --> 01:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
you know a PR sort of point of view in
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
the sense that we're known as a state
 
01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
without income tax but there are other
 
01:43:36.609 --> 01:43:36.619 align:start position:0%
states like Florida Texas Tennessee Etc
 
01:43:38.930 --> 01:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
that Washington state that we're
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
competing against for businesses and and
 
01:43:41.639 --> 01:43:42.609 align:start position:0%
competing against for businesses and and
and

01:43:42.609 --> 01:43:42.619 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:46.729 --> 01:43:46.739 align:start position:0%
people and so we have a little asterisk
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
by our no income tax and this would get
 
01:43:52.930 --> 01:43:52.940 align:start position:0%
rid of that asterisk
 
01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:55.739 align:start position:0%
uh I guess I'd like to ask for a
 
01:43:58.010 --> 01:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up question yes
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
um but the then the obvious next
 
01:44:02.209 --> 01:44:02.219 align:start position:0%
question is what Revenue are we
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
replacing it with
 
01:44:07.010 --> 01:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
what what what Revenue we're replacing
 
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:13.860 align:start position:0%
it specifically in the governor's budget
 
01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
um it started out with with eliminating
 
01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
the communication tax the communication
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
tax is a tax on telephone calls
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
right so it's a consumption tax it's
 
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
it's uh it brings in roughly 28 to 29
 
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:32.820 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year it's slowly
 
01:44:35.810 --> 01:44:35.820 align:start position:0%
declining because more and more of of
 
01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
the cost of telephones is data not not
 
01:44:42.649 --> 01:44:42.659 align:start position:0%
calls and it's a it's a tax on calls not
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
data so that's it's declining a little
 
01:44:45.649 --> 01:44:45.659 align:start position:0%
bit over time
 
01:44:51.169 --> 01:44:51.179 align:start position:0%
but we retain that tax so so compared to
 
01:44:55.010 --> 01:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
current law this is a net plus for the
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
state in terms of Revenue over a long
 
01:44:59.689 --> 01:44:59.699 align:start position:0%
period of time it's a it's a gain in
 
01:45:01.490 --> 01:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
this particular budget this particular
 
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
change is again in this budget of about
 
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars I think maybe 25 I
 
01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
don't remember exactly somewhere between
 
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
20 and 40 million dollars it's a hurt to
 
01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
the next binance budget but it's a gain
 
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
from for future budgets after that
 
01:45:20.930 --> 01:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
future bienniums of roughly 50 plus
 
01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
million dollars a budget so we we did in
 
01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:28.010 align:start position:0%
million dollars a budget so we we did in
fact

01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
um have less tax cuts if in just in
 
01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
terms of dollars than than the governor
 
01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:35.209 align:start position:0%
terms of dollars than than the governor
proposed

01:45:35.209 --> 01:45:35.219 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
how does that compare
 
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
um how does retaining the communications
 
01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
tax uh how does that compare in dollar
 
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
amounts to what we would have received
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
if we retained the interest and
 
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
dividends tax
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
the difference here is we're losing
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
remember that some years ago we decided
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
to downsize interest in dividends one
 
01:45:58.490 --> 01:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
percent a year
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
so it's it's fading away anyway we've
 
01:46:04.129 --> 01:46:04.139 align:start position:0%
accelerated its fade so we took out the
 
01:46:05.689 --> 01:46:05.699 align:start position:0%
two percent the one percent years
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
because they were bringing in very
 
01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
little so we're losing 17 million
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
overall by the way we've structured
 
01:46:14.689 --> 01:46:14.699 align:start position:0%
the going away of the interest in
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
dividends tax and so that was going away
 
01:46:20.270 --> 01:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
anyway we've accelerated its departure
 
01:46:24.290 --> 01:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
so we still have excellent Revenue we
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
have record revenue and it's increased
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
fairly well so by substituting as you
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%
said Communication Service tax that's
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
about 26 million a year so we have a
 
01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
game as as you're questioning it's 26
 
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
million and one losing 17 million in the
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
other it comes out fairly well positive
 
01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you over here
 
01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
so underneath page 23 under the DHA DHHS
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health division of
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health under the governor's
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.010 align:start position:0%
Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs
um

01:47:04.010 --> 01:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:07.129 --> 01:47:07.139 align:start position:0%
retaining that five percent gross liquor
 
01:47:07.139 --> 01:47:08.450 align:start position:0%
retaining that five percent gross liquor
profits

01:47:08.450 --> 01:47:08.460 align:start position:0%
profits
 
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
so that means like in fiscal year 24 and
 
01:47:15.410 --> 01:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
25 that's like 22 million
 
01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
what are they doing with that money what
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
is that commission doing on Alcohol and
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs who's being paid those
 
01:47:25.850 --> 01:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
profits uh what salaries are being paid
 
01:47:28.490 --> 01:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
do we know all that information
 
01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:29.930 align:start position:0%
do we know all that information
sure

01:47:29.930 --> 01:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
um all the relevant numbers to answer
 
01:47:34.729 --> 01:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
your question are not in this paragraph
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
what what this paragraph is saying is
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
after we meet
 
01:47:42.050 --> 01:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
long-standing I didn't make the promise
 
01:47:44.330 --> 01:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
I'm just keeping the promise of five
 
01:47:46.490 --> 01:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
percent of the alcohol funds go into
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
this commission it's going to add about
 
01:47:53.050 --> 01:47:53.060 align:start position:0%
1.1 million dollars so so where you see
 
01:47:56.330 --> 01:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
11.1 million transfer that's the total
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
the base was already prepared to be 10
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
million keeping the promise costs us
 
01:48:06.169 --> 01:48:06.179 align:start position:0%
another 1.1 million total of 11.1 so
 
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
that that those are the numbers to the
 
01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
to the question about the commission I'm
 
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm on that commission and
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
um what I've witnessed over the year or
 
01:48:20.689 --> 01:48:20.699 align:start position:0%
so that I've been on it is that there is
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
a tremendous cross-section of
 
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
stakeholders throughout New Hampshire
 
01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
who are on that from law enforcement to
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
behavioral Health to members of the
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:48:35.229 --> 01:48:35.239 align:start position:0%
to community providers it's just it's a
 
01:48:37.729 --> 01:48:37.739 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary group of stakeholders
 
01:48:40.609 --> 01:48:40.619 align:start position:0%
they're probably number I don't know 40
 
01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
or so and they have been in business for
 
01:48:49.370 --> 01:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
many years now and they have produced
 
01:48:52.370 --> 01:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
routinely budgets where they take the
 
01:48:55.129 --> 01:48:55.139 align:start position:0%
alcohol revenues and they allocate it to
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
various things like I got interested in
 
01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
how how can we fund some recovery around
 
01:49:04.729 --> 01:49:04.739 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence problem induced by
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol and drug and I was very pleased
 
01:49:09.290 --> 01:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
to find that they have they already had
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
three separate programs where they were
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
funding different kinds of domestic
 
01:49:16.609 --> 01:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
violence interventions that totaled
 
01:49:20.689 --> 01:49:20.699 align:start position:0%
something like 600 700 000. so so I
 
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
can't tell you the whole thing I can
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
tell you I think that the the
 
01:49:24.239 --> 01:49:25.510 align:start position:0%
tell you I think that the the
commissions

01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
budgets are online they are subject in
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
91a like like any of us and so the their
 
01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
budgets are publicly accessible
 
01:49:37.490 --> 01:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
okay it's just everything that's over
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars is supposed to run
 
01:49:40.189 --> 01:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
through the house and this special
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
commission which is millions of dollars
 
01:49:44.689 --> 01:49:44.699 align:start position:0%
is funneling money into areas where we
 
01:49:46.729 --> 01:49:46.739 align:start position:0%
should be making those decisions I mean
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's just I know this is a huge budget
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of things to go
 
01:49:52.250 --> 01:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
through but being a Freshman as well
 
01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
these are the types of things that offer
 
01:49:56.450 --> 01:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
a red flag for me and it should offer a
 
01:49:57.890 --> 01:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
red flag for
 
01:50:00.410 --> 01:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
um our constituents so
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
but thank you so I share the the
 
01:50:06.109 --> 01:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
representatives uh interest in the
 
01:50:08.689 --> 01:50:08.699 align:start position:0%
commission and how it's funded and how
 
01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
it sort of skirts our constitutional
 
01:50:14.810 --> 01:50:14.820 align:start position:0%
duty to control spending
 
01:50:18.050 --> 01:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
um but I I it it happened before me it
 
01:50:20.209 --> 01:50:20.219 align:start position:0%
happened you know or when I was a
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
freshman you never know what happens
 
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
when you're a freshman uh but but
 
01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
anyways if if it's something you want to
 
01:50:28.669 --> 01:50:28.679 align:start position:0%
look at in the future I'd be happy to
 
01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:35.689 --> 01:50:35.699 align:start position:0%
next thank you very much
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
um someone returned to the uh top of the
 
01:50:40.250 --> 01:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
interesting dividends tax in the
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
rationale Ford is
 
01:50:44.689 --> 01:50:44.699 align:start position:0%
I understand is that this will be make
 
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire into a magnet for the
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
nation's High High
 
01:50:50.330 --> 01:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
um let's say high wealth individuals
 
01:50:52.370 --> 01:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
that they're all going to be abandoning
 
01:50:54.410 --> 01:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
Tennessee and Florida and California
 
01:50:55.970 --> 01:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
other states and they're all going to
 
01:50:59.209 --> 01:50:59.219 align:start position:0%
race here and we also although we're not
 
01:51:01.010 --> 01:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
doing anything new to the business taxes
 
01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
that was also rational for the business
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
tax that all the entrepreneurs are all
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to want to shut down their
 
01:51:08.570 --> 01:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
businesses in Massachusetts New York and
 
01:51:11.689 --> 01:51:11.699 align:start position:0%
all come here my question is uh
 
01:51:13.609 --> 01:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
one problem that is where are all these
 
01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
people going to live are they going to
 
01:51:18.649 --> 01:51:18.659 align:start position:0%
crowd out uh working age families who
 
01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
are already in New Hampshire and um
 
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is uh I did notice
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
this budget is free of culture War stuff
 
01:51:27.649 --> 01:51:27.659 align:start position:0%
and is that partially reaction to what's
 
01:51:29.450 --> 01:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
kind of gone wrong in Tennessee what we
 
01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
see going on in Tennessee in Florida and
 
01:51:33.709 --> 01:51:33.719 align:start position:0%
other states where
 
01:51:33.719 --> 01:51:34.310 align:start position:0%
other states where
um

01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:35.930 --> 01:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
you know their Governors have kind of
 
01:51:37.850 --> 01:51:37.860 align:start position:0%
Taken on some controversial uh
 
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
conference issues which uh
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
you know which are not necessarily uh
 
01:51:45.370 --> 01:51:45.380 align:start position:0%
not necessarily liking to everybody
 
01:51:47.330 --> 01:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
including some of the high wealth
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
individuals who have moved to those
 
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
states to avoid taxes so how do we how
 
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
do we do this so how do we invite these
 
01:51:56.930 --> 01:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
people here while still like uh having
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
room for uh you know younger people to
 
01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
live in the state and what plans have we
 
01:52:03.290 --> 01:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
made from the incredible growth that all
 
01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
these tax cuts are going to supposedly
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
cause thanks so so representative
 
01:52:10.850 --> 01:52:10.860 align:start position:0%
Corrigan uh it's good it's good to see
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
you back in the house I'm glad you're
 
01:52:15.649 --> 01:52:15.659 align:start position:0%
doing well yep I was going to ask you if
 
01:52:18.109 --> 01:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
you had any candy to share with us but I
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.010 --> 01:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
but um but I'm glad you're I'm glad
 
01:52:27.169 --> 01:52:27.179 align:start position:0%
you're doing well you you're asking a
 
01:52:28.490 --> 01:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
very Broad
 
01:52:32.090 --> 01:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
question and I think we're here today to
 
01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
talk about budget specifics and you're
 
01:52:37.250 --> 01:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
you're you're bringing up the
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
fundamental issues on the distinctions
 
01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
between at least the two primary parties
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
in the country right and so rather than
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
elaborate to let you know that I think
 
01:52:51.649 --> 01:52:51.659 align:start position:0%
I'm right and you're probably not I I
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
would I would just say that there hasn't
 
01:52:55.370 --> 01:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
been a five-year government plan ever
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
that's really worked well and to the
 
01:53:00.890 --> 01:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
extent that we have they're able to
 
01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
enjoy the success of of a society it's
 
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
largely delivered by the free market and
 
01:53:10.729 --> 01:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
so the hope is if we can stimulate you
 
01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
know the money the movement of money
 
01:53:18.129 --> 01:53:18.139 align:start position:0%
capital and people into the state uh
 
01:53:20.689 --> 01:53:20.699 align:start position:0%
localities can figure out the rest and
 
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
as you know we're trying to work on the
 
01:53:24.109 --> 01:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
housing problem okay great thanks and I
 
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that we should get into
 
01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
and there is some housing
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
debate on the floor here great thanks
 
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
next question over here yes Lisa and um
 
01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:39.719 align:start position:0%
I was interested in the children's
 
01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health
 
01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
now you had referenced that
 
01:53:46.129 --> 01:53:46.139 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to step back because
 
01:53:48.890 --> 01:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing myself you had referenced
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
the other issue with the emergency room
 
01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
being filled with people in an
 
01:53:57.890 --> 01:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
inappropriate way and
 
01:53:59.810 --> 01:53:59.820 align:start position:0%
is this what's happening to these
 
01:54:01.729 --> 01:54:01.739 align:start position:0%
children or are there other facilities
 
01:54:05.470 --> 01:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
for them to go to where that money is
 
01:54:08.209 --> 01:54:08.219 align:start position:0%
it's a representative I just have to
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
tell you I have a very hard time hearing
 
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
and and so what I what I think you're
 
01:54:16.370 --> 01:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
asking about is a bullet here on page 23
 
01:54:18.770 --> 01:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to tell you I I have
 
01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
an ear infection so like everything is
 
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
reverberating in my head so I'm sorry
 
01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
for that but I'm just I'm wanting to
 
01:54:29.209 --> 01:54:29.219 align:start position:0%
know if there are facilities for those
 
01:54:31.490 --> 01:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
children already in place that aren't in
 
01:54:34.129 --> 01:54:34.139 align:start position:0%
an emergency room or is this for money
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
to be put for more beds for that kind of
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
thing so so by and large we don't have
 
01:54:44.090 --> 01:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
as much of a facility problem for the
 
01:54:46.609 --> 01:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
capacity that we're looking to have
 
01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
prior to somebody being admitted to an
 
01:54:53.590 --> 01:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
ER we're we're having more of a a human
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
bandwidth problem where we don't have
 
01:54:59.810 --> 01:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
the workforce to maximize the capability
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the existing facilities now that's a
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
very general statement in in specific
 
01:55:08.330 --> 01:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
areas it's going to be off but as far as
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:18.669 --> 01:55:18.679 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:55:22.370 --> 01:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
you know have more
 
01:55:26.209 --> 01:55:26.219 align:start position:0%
intense treatment
 
01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
so so if we accept that we have too many
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
people staying in the emergency rooms
 
01:55:35.570 --> 01:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
because they don't have a place to be
 
01:55:38.209 --> 01:55:38.219 align:start position:0%
discharged and there are too many people
 
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
in the hospital
 
01:55:42.290 --> 01:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
ERS because we didn't have adequate care
 
01:55:44.330 --> 01:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
for them prior to them going to the
 
01:55:46.729 --> 01:55:46.739 align:start position:0%
emergency room we're trying to solve
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
both of those problems on the on the on
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
the front end you know the idea is if
 
01:55:57.590 --> 01:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
you can get in front of a kid and start
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
to provide them with the behavioral
 
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
health counseling and support and yes
 
01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes some medication you can keep
 
01:56:07.129 --> 01:56:07.139 align:start position:0%
them out of the ER to begin with so that
 
01:56:10.370 --> 01:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
that's that's basically sort of the you
 
01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
know the clinical objective of much of
 
01:56:14.689 --> 01:56:14.699 align:start position:0%
this on the front end is to provide them
 
01:56:16.910 --> 01:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
the treatment so that they don't end up
 
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
in the ER to begin with
 
01:56:21.530 --> 01:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
so that's more like Staffing getting
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
Staffing Staffing is our biggest problem
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
I mean money and Staffing those are the
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
two big things
 
01:56:32.090 --> 01:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:34.189 align:start position:0%
 
next

01:56:34.189 --> 01:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:56:35.930 --> 01:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
representative owes
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative Bose this is a general
 
01:56:40.250 --> 01:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
budget question
 
01:56:44.450 --> 01:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
in 2021 the tax Foundation ranked New
 
01:56:47.689 --> 01:56:47.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 47th in the nation in per
 
01:56:49.490 --> 01:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
capita spending
 
01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
for taxes at 2 313 dollars per person
 
01:56:57.129 --> 01:56:57.139 align:start position:0%
how will the
 
01:56:59.930 --> 01:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
12.7 percent increase in this budget
 
01:57:02.930 --> 01:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
affect our ranking and our per capita
 
01:57:06.290 --> 01:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
spending for taxes in the state
 
01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
until we know all the other states we
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
don't know where we stand I suspect
 
01:57:12.770 --> 01:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
they'll all have to go up just to keep
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
people working because like we've seen
 
01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
I think the major problem we heard from
 
01:57:20.030 --> 01:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
all the people that testified before us
 
01:57:23.149 --> 01:57:23.159 align:start position:0%
we can't get Staffing why can't we get
 
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
Staffing because they can make more
 
01:57:26.930 --> 01:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
money somewhere else if we can't be
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
competitive in the wages we're still
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
going to have Staffing problems and I
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
suspect it's it's Nationwide so when we
 
01:57:36.109 --> 01:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
see what other states do then we'll get
 
01:57:38.810 --> 01:57:38.820 align:start position:0%
an idea we we still have some very good
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
ranking among all the states and I don't
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
expect that we'll change all that much
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
next question
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman a question
 
01:57:50.330 --> 01:57:50.340 align:start position:0%
directly to representative Edwards
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
specific to page 22 and the
 
01:57:55.070 --> 01:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
developmental services
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
funding within that funding if you would
 
01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
clarify the following or answer the
 
01:58:02.330 --> 01:58:02.340 align:start position:0%
following question the developmental
 
01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
Services wait list
 
01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:05.629 align:start position:0%
Services wait list
is

01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:05.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:58:09.430 --> 01:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
do I understand that's within that 830
 
01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:16.970 --> 01:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
yes and to follow up on that is in
 
01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
meeting the current uh census of where
 
01:58:22.030 --> 01:58:22.040 align:start position:0%
these funding numbers will come from
 
01:58:25.729 --> 01:58:25.739 align:start position:0%
will this allow for rate hourly rate
 
01:58:28.609 --> 01:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
increases because that's the biggest as
 
01:58:30.290 --> 01:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
related to other subject matter it's
 
01:58:32.450 --> 01:58:32.460 align:start position:0%
already discussed that we are not
 
01:58:34.669 --> 01:58:34.679 align:start position:0%
finding enough people to do the job in
 
01:58:35.810 --> 01:58:35.820 align:start position:0%
the home and community-based care
 
01:58:39.890 --> 01:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
because the rate of hourly rate is not
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
enough of an incentive for folks to take
 
01:58:44.030 --> 01:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
on these jobs is that allowed within
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
your discussions and the funding that
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
was hereby presented
 
01:58:52.430 --> 01:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
no but um when we did the targeted
 
01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement rate hikes we we
 
01:59:00.649 --> 01:59:00.659 align:start position:0%
allocated funding on an algorithmic
 
01:59:00.659 --> 01:59:01.750 align:start position:0%
allocated funding on an algorithmic
basis

01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
to where uh we funded 20 different lines
 
01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
of Provider Services all in an effort to
 
01:59:13.850 --> 01:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
continue to build capacity this this
 
01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
these line items are specialized efforts
 
01:59:21.550 --> 01:59:21.560 align:start position:0%
to do that also with more money chasing
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat limited Workforce with the
 
01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
hopes that it'll stimulate people from
 
01:59:30.109 --> 01:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to work here or people
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
that live in New Hampshire working in
 
01:59:34.970 --> 01:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to stay and work here so
 
01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:36.830 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to stay and work here so
it's

01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
okay one more follow-up Mr chairman sure
 
01:59:41.089 --> 01:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
I just don't know who the authority of
 
01:59:43.010 --> 01:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
in jurisdiction is here I want to make
 
01:59:46.430 --> 01:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
sure I do it right uh the the issue was
 
01:59:49.070 --> 01:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
on the then the hourly rate and what was
 
01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
the challenge in the last uh
 
01:59:54.169 --> 01:59:54.179 align:start position:0%
two terms was that we had a cap of
 
01:59:56.570 --> 01:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars per thousand if not per
 
01:59:59.810 --> 01:59:59.820 align:start position:0%
thousand per hour is we need to get
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
closer to 20. for this these issues to
 
02:00:04.609 --> 02:00:04.619 align:start position:0%
be filled and it was that part of the
 
02:00:04.619 --> 02:00:06.229 align:start position:0%
be filled and it was that part of the
discussion

02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:00:08.450 --> 02:00:08.460 align:start position:0%
there's two parts of the problem as the
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
chairman was pointing out one is the
 
02:00:13.550 --> 02:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
rates that you're discussing the other
 
02:00:16.609 --> 02:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
is the need the line item you're talking
 
02:00:18.770 --> 02:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
about is the need the rates are in the
 
02:00:20.689 --> 02:00:20.699 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate setting this particular
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
all three of these bullets in this
 
02:00:26.089 --> 02:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
particular area require by law
 
02:00:28.370 --> 02:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
that they be budgeted for at the full
 
02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:29.470 align:start position:0%
that they be budgeted for at the full
need

02:00:29.470 --> 02:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether that need can be
 
02:00:33.530 --> 02:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
met so these numbers that are in here
 
02:00:36.169 --> 02:00:36.179 align:start position:0%
have to be there based on the need
 
02:00:37.970 --> 02:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
whether that whether whether that need
 
02:00:39.649 --> 02:00:39.659 align:start position:0%
can be met or not be met if we can't
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
change on the funding with these funds
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
where we changed around the funding was
 
02:00:45.649 --> 02:00:45.659 align:start position:0%
on the Medicaid rate setting side where
 
02:00:47.330 --> 02:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
hopefully that will increase our
 
02:00:49.850 --> 02:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
capacity to address more of the need
 
02:00:52.250 --> 02:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
so so uh no as usual
 
02:00:59.149 --> 02:00:59.159 align:start position:0%
um now unfortunately it's the law you
 
02:01:01.609 --> 02:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
know we're stuck with that no no without
 
02:01:03.169 --> 02:01:03.179 align:start position:0%
respect sir I'm very familiar with the
 
02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
law being here 20 years but the key is
 
02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:09.300 align:start position:0%
whether the rate of pay does not have a
 
02:01:12.169 --> 02:01:12.179 align:start position:0%
false cap and that it can respond to the
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
market so that these families can have
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
these Services provided in the home yes
 
02:01:18.589 --> 02:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
you understand that and you but what
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
you're missing is that that's why we
 
02:01:22.609 --> 02:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
worked on increasing the Medicaid rates
 
02:01:25.850 --> 02:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
right right to increase the capacity but
 
02:01:28.250 --> 02:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
by law this part of the budget there's
 
02:01:31.010 --> 02:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
two parts of the budget this part has to
 
02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:31.729 align:start position:0%
two parts of the budget this part has to
be

02:01:31.729 --> 02:01:31.739 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
set based on current rates and the need
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of the ability to fulfill the
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
need over the biennium
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
okay I'll stipulate to that I do
 
02:01:44.689 --> 02:01:44.699 align:start position:0%
understand that it's are we meeting the
 
02:01:47.689 --> 02:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
challenge and I don't that's what I'm
 
02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
concerned about that's why I asked the
 
02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
question fair enough but we gotta if you
 
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
want if these funds want to be used for
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
another purpose you have to change the
 
02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
law that's the bottom line these
 
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
particular line items
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
all right I appreciate your patience
 
02:02:03.709 --> 02:02:03.719 align:start position:0%
while we go through all these fine
 
02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
points on the budget I want to I don't
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
want to waste the extra dollars we spent
 
02:02:10.729 --> 02:02:10.739 align:start position:0%
on color
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
for these items that we spend for the
 
02:02:16.490 --> 02:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
big picture and while we're talking the
 
02:02:19.129 --> 02:02:19.139 align:start position:0%
other legislative budget assistants who
 
02:02:21.169 --> 02:02:21.179 align:start position:0%
have assisted in all the divisions I
 
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
want to point to the chief legislative
 
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
budget assistant overall it sees this
 
02:02:28.370 --> 02:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
and that's Mr Michael Kane who is the
 
02:02:31.729 --> 02:02:31.739 align:start position:0%
elected legislative budget assistant
 
02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
and back here by the doors his number
 
02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:35.390 align:start position:0%
and back here by the doors his number
two

02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:37.430 align:start position:0%
two
Chris

02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
Chris
 
02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say the wrong last name I
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.089 --> 02:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
Chris Shea
 
02:02:45.890 --> 02:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
done that before
 
02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:48.530 align:start position:0%
done that before
so

02:02:48.530 --> 02:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:49.669 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:53.149 --> 02:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
page page two you'll see where we're
 
02:02:55.609 --> 02:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
going to spend the general funds
 
02:02:57.770 --> 02:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
throughout the budget
 
02:03:00.890 --> 02:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
and then someone who's very sharp will
 
02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:02.330 align:start position:0%
and then someone who's very sharp will
question

02:03:02.330 --> 02:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:03:05.689 --> 02:03:05.699 align:start position:0%
compared with page five
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
one says
 
02:03:13.450 --> 02:03:13.460 align:start position:0%
3.975 billion the other one says
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
3.732.7 million or 3 billion why is
 
02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
there a difference
 
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
the difference is
 
02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
page two is spending a little bit of
 
02:03:29.330 --> 02:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
surplus from 2023
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
page five is showing what we're taking
 
02:03:36.410 --> 02:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
in by Ways and Means estimates from
 
02:03:39.169 --> 02:03:39.179 align:start position:0%
2024 and 2025
 
02:03:41.149 --> 02:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
less money because it doesn't have the
 
02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
Surplus included in it that's what we
 
02:03:45.599 --> 02:03:46.850 align:start position:0%
Surplus included in it that's what we
collect

02:03:46.850 --> 02:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
collect
 
02:03:50.270 --> 02:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
and just also page three
 
02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:51.530 align:start position:0%
and just also page three
is

02:03:51.530 --> 02:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
where the money goes out total funds so
 
02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
that includes not just general funds
 
02:03:59.330 --> 02:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
which is just one small part but all the
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
total funds
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
and the page below that again page four
 
02:04:07.490 --> 02:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's where the Appropriations come in
 
02:04:09.709 --> 02:04:09.719 align:start position:0%
from all the funds and you'll see there
 
02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:12.719 align:start position:0%
the page four the big blue piece federal
 
02:04:16.129 --> 02:04:16.139 align:start position:0%
funds that's a pretty good piece 32
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
percent so finally we're getting back a
 
02:04:19.490 --> 02:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
little of our
 
02:04:22.129 --> 02:04:22.139 align:start position:0%
income tax we don't get back as much as
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
most States but we get back something so
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
all so those those things are very
 
02:04:31.850 --> 02:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
illustrative in my mind I always ask LBA
 
02:04:34.129 --> 02:04:34.139 align:start position:0%
since I first got on this committee put
 
02:04:36.169 --> 02:04:36.179 align:start position:0%
them in pie charts I'll understand them
 
02:04:36.179 --> 02:04:37.370 align:start position:0%
them in pie charts I'll understand them
better

02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
so those those are all very good things
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
to look at as well as when you go to
 
02:04:46.609 --> 02:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
pages of 24 through 35 where you see a
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
lot of spreadsheets and these are also
 
02:04:51.530 --> 02:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
important in getting an overall
 
02:04:54.169 --> 02:04:54.179 align:start position:0%
understanding of the budget
 
02:04:54.179 --> 02:04:55.490 align:start position:0%
understanding of the budget
the

02:04:55.490 --> 02:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:59.089 --> 02:04:59.099 align:start position:0%
page 24 shows the combined
 
02:05:02.990 --> 02:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
statement of general and education trust
 
02:05:05.870 --> 02:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
funds and some of the some of the places
 
02:05:08.689 --> 02:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
they're collected and spent and you go
 
02:05:11.149 --> 02:05:11.159 align:start position:0%
to page 25
 
02:05:14.089 --> 02:05:14.099 align:start position:0%
and you see the statement for just the
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
general funds so that's a whole
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
different thing as I say when you
 
02:05:19.850 --> 02:05:19.860 align:start position:0%
realize the general funds are only one
 
02:05:23.330 --> 02:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
small part of the total spending
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
then Paige page 26 we start to look at
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
schedule one which kind of breaks it
 
02:05:31.609 --> 02:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
down a little more into where the money
 
02:05:34.729 --> 02:05:34.739 align:start position:0%
is coming in specifically
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
and schedule two
 
02:05:39.310 --> 02:05:39.320 align:start position:0%
shows the general fund
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
distributions across government and
 
02:05:44.089 --> 02:05:44.099 align:start position:0%
where some of them are going by various
 
02:05:47.689 --> 02:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
bills like Senate bill Senate bill one
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
and HB 384 HP 504
 
02:05:53.209 --> 02:05:53.219 align:start position:0%
some of the where those monies are being
 
02:05:55.850 --> 02:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
spent schedule two goes on for a few
 
02:05:55.860 --> 02:05:57.770 align:start position:0%
spent schedule two goes on for a few
pages

02:05:57.770 --> 02:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
pages
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
and then the education trust fund has
 
02:06:03.649 --> 02:06:03.659 align:start position:0%
its own three pages so you can see where
 
02:06:06.109 --> 02:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund money monies
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
are going
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
uh and you'll see that we're not
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
shorting anybody
 
02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:12.770 align:start position:0%
shorting anybody
but

02:06:12.770 --> 02:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:06:15.169 --> 02:06:15.179 align:start position:0%
these are a very good
 
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
items for understanding
 
02:06:21.649 --> 02:06:21.659 align:start position:0%
and then the last page 35 is is the Aid
 
02:06:24.290 --> 02:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
by category where that's going out and
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
all the different
 
02:06:25.679 --> 02:06:26.629 align:start position:0%
all the different
uh

02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:28.609 --> 02:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
types of funds some of it's going into
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
Highway fund and so on so
 
02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
I hope this has helped it's very
 
02:06:37.970 --> 02:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
complicated and an old expression we
 
02:06:40.070 --> 02:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
used in the military it's like you're
 
02:06:42.649 --> 02:06:42.659 align:start position:0%
drinking from a fire hose most of it's
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
going by you and maybe you'll remember
 
02:06:47.930 --> 02:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
some of it later but
 
02:06:49.790 --> 02:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
any one of us would be willing to sit
 
02:06:51.709 --> 02:06:51.719 align:start position:0%
down and explain any parts of this that
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have time to do right now but I
 
02:06:55.729 --> 02:06:55.739 align:start position:0%
appreciate your attendance appreciate
 
02:06:57.709 --> 02:06:57.719 align:start position:0%
your your ability to learn all this
 
02:06:57.719 --> 02:06:58.729 align:start position:0%
your your ability to learn all this
about

02:06:58.729 --> 02:06:58.739 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
the state budget it's the most
 
02:07:02.990 --> 02:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
complicated Bill we have and it's the
 
02:07:06.050 --> 02:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
most important vote that you'll cast and
 
02:07:08.450 --> 02:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
as I said not everything in here pleases
 
02:07:11.209 --> 02:07:11.219 align:start position:0%
everybody not even me certainly not the
 
02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
governor because we've made changes that
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
he will probably be upset about
 
02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:17.510 align:start position:0%
he will probably be upset about
but

02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:07:20.030 --> 02:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
you have to remember this is the place
 
02:07:22.370 --> 02:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
where the budget is made no other place
 
02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
I appreciated having a couple of
 
02:07:26.570 --> 02:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
senators here to listen and they've left
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
now but obviously if there are things
 
02:07:32.089 --> 02:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
that we look at
 
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
Thursday and said aha there's a new
 
02:07:37.010 --> 02:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
Amendment what should we have done about
 
02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:38.030 align:start position:0%
Amendment what should we have done about
it

02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
there's another chance take it to the
 
02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:41.510 align:start position:0%
there's another chance take it to the
Senate

02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
02:07:44.270 --> 02:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
they will listen and maybe it's such a
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
great idea you can convince 14 of them
 
02:07:48.830 --> 02:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
ways you might not have been able to
 
02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:49.970 align:start position:0%
ways you might not have been able to
convince

02:07:49.970 --> 02:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
convince
 
02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
200 people here so there's another
 
02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:54.050 align:start position:0%
200 people here so there's another
chance

02:07:54.050 --> 02:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
chance
 
02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
at the at the budget when we go to the
 
02:07:58.970 --> 02:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
Senate they'll be kind of speeding it up
 
02:08:00.530 --> 02:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
but they will be using a lot of what
 
02:08:02.930 --> 02:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
we've done they always have in the past
 
02:08:04.970 --> 02:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
and make some little changes to them to
 
02:08:07.010 --> 02:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
their own one of the things that
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
concerns us all as I said this is
 
02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
unprecedented both for the for the
 
02:08:14.810 --> 02:08:14.820 align:start position:0%
amount of of
 
02:08:17.089 --> 02:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
of inflation we have to deal with the
 
02:08:19.550 --> 02:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
amount of jobs that we can't fill those
 
02:08:21.290 --> 02:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
are unprecedented we've never heard so
 
02:08:23.870 --> 02:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
much about those as we've had this year
 
02:08:26.810 --> 02:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
what's going to go happen going forward
 
02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
usually the Senate sees
 
02:08:32.810 --> 02:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
the the budget the uh the revenue from
 
02:08:35.089 --> 02:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
April and May
 
02:08:37.250 --> 02:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
that we don't get to see
 
02:08:39.169 --> 02:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
and quite often it's higher those are
 
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
some of the biggest months if you're on
 
02:08:43.129 --> 02:08:43.139 align:start position:0%
ways and means you understand that April
 
02:08:46.129 --> 02:08:46.139 align:start position:0%
and May big months business taxes come
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
in big time and everybody's paying their
 
02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
federal income taxes at the same time
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
putting aside their state income taxes
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
business income business Enterprise tax
 
02:08:57.530 --> 02:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
and business profit Stacks so quite
 
02:08:59.570 --> 02:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
often they can sit there and have more
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
money to spend than we do and they
 
02:09:03.950 --> 02:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
usually lot it over us for me go to the
 
02:09:05.930 --> 02:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
committee of conference you didn't fund
 
02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
this properly but anyway I don't know
 
02:09:10.850 --> 02:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
what will happen going forward
 
02:09:13.970 --> 02:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
people keep predicting recession
 
02:09:16.070 --> 02:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
will we start to see it in April May I
 
02:09:19.870 --> 02:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
hope not but we may see it in 24 and 25
 
02:09:22.850 --> 02:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to spend everything that
 
02:09:25.250 --> 02:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
we hope goes to the rainy day fund
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
because it may be coming it may be
 
02:09:30.050 --> 02:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
coming in the next budget we may have a
 
02:09:31.970 --> 02:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
problem so we don't want to listen to
 
02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
amendments they're saying oh you're
 
02:09:35.209 --> 02:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
putting money in the rainy day fund we
 
02:09:37.310 --> 02:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
should put it here
 
02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
I don't know how rainy it's going to be
 
02:09:40.070 --> 02:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
in 20
 
02:09:42.169 --> 02:09:42.179 align:start position:0%
6 and 27
 
02:09:45.290 --> 02:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
and I hope it is isn't as bad as some
 
02:09:47.870 --> 02:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
have predicted but let's keep that in
 
02:09:50.330 --> 02:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
mind when people want to say why are you
 
02:09:52.070 --> 02:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
putting money in the rainy day fund I
 
02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
want to put in my project
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
please be with me we may need to plan a
 
02:09:59.149 --> 02:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
little further into the future than the
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
next two years so I appreciate the fact
 
02:10:02.930 --> 02:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
that we're all here we're willing to
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
answer any of your questions take me
 
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
aside whenever you catch me and I'll
 
02:10:11.089 --> 02:10:11.099 align:start position:0%
have this I'll carry this around with me
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
call me on the phone if you want any of
 
02:10:16.250 --> 02:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
us that are close to you and we'll do
 
02:10:18.589 --> 02:10:18.599 align:start position:0%
our best to try to reason it out it's
 
02:10:18.599 --> 02:10:19.609 align:start position:0%
our best to try to reason it out it's
difficult

02:10:19.609 --> 02:10:19.619 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:10:21.530 --> 02:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
having all these things in the air as
 
02:10:22.970 --> 02:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
I've said before
 
02:10:25.129 --> 02:10:25.139 align:start position:0%
sometimes we find something it seems
 
02:10:27.169 --> 02:10:27.179 align:start position:0%
like a lot of money two years from now
 
02:10:28.729 --> 02:10:28.739 align:start position:0%
we'll look back and say hey what'd you
 
02:10:29.870 --> 02:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
do with that money
 
02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
and we also sometimes call for audits
 
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
from the legislative budget assistant
 
02:10:36.649 --> 02:10:36.659 align:start position:0%
also has a whole other group that do
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
Audits and I like to look at those
 
02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
Audits and see so how did it all work
 
02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:41.209 align:start position:0%
Audits and see so how did it all work
out

02:10:41.209 --> 02:10:41.219 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:10:43.609 --> 02:10:43.619 align:start position:0%
and if I find out that the money wasn't
 
02:10:46.189 --> 02:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
well spent or maybe it wasn't even spent
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
then we can pull it back
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
last year's budget was was balanced
 
02:10:55.010 --> 02:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
hundreds of employees in
 
02:11:00.770 --> 02:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services that never got
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
hired money was there but they didn't
 
02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
hire him they couldn't hire him whatever
 
02:11:07.010 --> 02:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
reason I don't even think they had the
 
02:11:08.990 --> 02:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
office space for them but that helped us
 
02:11:11.209 --> 02:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
balance the budget so we follow up on
 
02:11:13.310 --> 02:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
all the money we hand out how is it
 
02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
spent what were the results did it work
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
please be with us anything you find out
 
02:11:22.250 --> 02:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
come and tell us we're always happy to
 
02:11:24.890 --> 02:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
hear whatever you hear out there in the
 
02:11:28.370 --> 02:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
Hinterlands seeing all your your
 
02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
your constituents and some of them might
 
02:11:32.450 --> 02:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
be state employees who will be willing
 
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
to share with you something that they
 
02:11:36.770 --> 02:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
would be afraid to say
 
02:11:39.530 --> 02:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
in their office so we're always looking
 
02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
for those little tidbits and I
 
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate your attention and thank you
 
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
very much and I think if representative
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
Osborne may be here to take over
 
02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
for a caucus is he still here
 
02:11:52.260 --> 02:11:55.609 align:start position:0%
for a caucus is he still here
oh

02:11:55.609 --> 02:11:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:56.930 --> 02:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
so I believe there'll be a republican
 
02:12:02.089 --> 02:12:02.099 align:start position:0%
caucus so I think we have a few
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
Democrats that are probably going to
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
depart but I appreciate that being here
 
02:12:08.450 --> 02:12:08.460 align:start position:0%
to listen to the budget presentation
 
02:12:08.460 --> 02:12:10.070 align:start position:0%
to listen to the budget presentation
and

02:12:10.070 --> 02:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
finding out all you can it's a very
 
02:12:14.570 --> 02:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
complicated thing I'm still learning
