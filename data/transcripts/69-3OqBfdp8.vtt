for this amendment
 
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
relates to
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
confusion basically over the term
 
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
secondary school
 
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
there has
 
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.950 align:start position:0%
there has
developed

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
developed
 
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
a situation
 
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
in at least one middle school
 
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
in which
 
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.909 align:start position:0%
in which
teachers

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
are teaching
 
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
same grade
 
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
pre-algebra and algebra classes that are
 
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
taught in the high school
 
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
student loans and under the student loan
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
forgiveness program
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
one teacher is receiving uh their full
 
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
17 000
 
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
in forgiveness but the other teacher
 
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
because they are teaching
 
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.390 align:start position:0%
because they are teaching
the

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
eighth grade
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
so as you'll see in the letter i think
 
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
that it should have made its way around
 
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.670 align:start position:0%
that it should have made its way around
from

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 align:start position:0%
a division chief at the u.s department
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
of education
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
it explains
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
the situation and the confusion over
 
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
in several places as pointed out in
 
00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.189 align:start position:0%
in several places as pointed out in
there

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
secondary school
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
is defined
 
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.270 align:start position:0%
is defined
as

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
uh a junior high school program
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh in several places it is defined um as
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
anything above elementary school and
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
actually in rules um
 
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.110 align:start position:0%
actually in rules um
uh

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
they are two different categories
 
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
there's elementary and then secondary
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
and that's all that is covered um in
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
rules so
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh secondary is clearly not elementary
 
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
junior high school
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
as well as high school level
 
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
so in the non-german
 
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.870 align:start position:0%
so in the non-german
amendment

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
as you can see in lines
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
through 20
 
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
it defines
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
teachers in grades 7 through 12
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
to be considered secondary school
 
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.430 align:start position:0%
to be considered secondary school
teachers

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
which will satisfy
 
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.430 align:start position:0%
which will satisfy
the

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
student loan
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
office and allow
 
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.469 align:start position:0%
office and allow
both

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
teachers teaching the same course
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
to receive their full loan forgiveness
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
rather than just uh the half as is uh
 
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
currently uh been decided um by the uh
 
00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
loan office
 
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
so uh that's the basis of the um
 
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment um representative hill
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%

woodcock
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman good morning glenn
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
good morning as we go as regards the uh
 
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
license on a licensure or certification
 
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
um by the state for for faculty and
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
those grade levels um
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
below the the typical high school level
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
below the nine or 12
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh those in the middle school does that
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
is that going to have a repercussion or
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
a domino effect on licensure
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
certification the requirements being
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
different for those two grade levels
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
because as specified in lines 18 19 it's
 
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this program that
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
it's uh defining the grade 7
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
through 12 teacher as secondary
 
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:35.909 align:start position:0%
through 12 teacher as secondary
and

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:35.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:36.790 align:start position:0%
and
in

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
rules now
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
it's basically just elementary or
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
secondary education
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
so there won't be any certification
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
changes on the state level right okay
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
correct thank you thank you mr chairman
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%

questions one is i noticed in this in
 
00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.070 align:start position:0%
questions one is i noticed in this in
the

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
in different places it call it
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
references a separate organization
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
consisting of grades seven through nine
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
or a separate organization four through
 
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.790 align:start position:0%
or a separate organization four through
eight

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
um by calling it a separate organization
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
does that mean that it's not a school
 
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.269 align:start position:0%
does that mean that it's not a school
district

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:26.310 align:start position:0%
district
or

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
is it can it be tuition schools
 
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.829 align:start position:0%
is it can it be tuition schools
um

00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
is there a particular statute you're
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
referring to that where that is
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
distinction is made
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
in your amendment 189. okay i'm sorry on
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
line 13
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
and then it's repeated again on line 15.
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
right that's that's in current statute
 
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.829 align:start position:0%
right that's that's in current statute
now

00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
um it's existing right yes it's existing
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
language but i'm wondering if
 
00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:54.630 align:start position:0%
language but i'm wondering if
that

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
that means that um
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
that covers uh tuition schools for
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
tuition purposes and um
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
you know uh prenda and those kinds of i
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
believe this is talking about public
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
schools um
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
in this uh section of law
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
okay and my second question is
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
how can we um
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
at the state level influence uh
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
federal teacher loan forgiveness
 
00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:23.829 align:start position:0%
federal teacher loan forgiveness
programs

00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:25.269 align:start position:0%
programs
um

00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
i think as indicated in the
 
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.670 align:start position:0%
i think as indicated in the
accompanying

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
accompanying
 
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.350 align:start position:0%
accompanying
letter

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
letter
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
i think that if we clarify
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
that uh as we did in lines 18 to 20
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
that those grades are
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh considered secondary for the purposes
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
of this program i think that that
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
from everything i've been told uh should
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
satisfy it so that the teacher can get
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
their full
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much mr chair um is
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
there going to be any um
 
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.190 align:start position:0%
there going to be any um
um

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
retroactive uh
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
um uh i guess loan forgiveness for maybe
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
a teacher who
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
who taught in seventh or eighth grade
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
prior to the
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
establishment of this policy
 
00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:23.030 align:start position:0%
establishment of this policy
um

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
i i don't believe so but uh i'm not in
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
the loan forgiveness
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
business but i
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh i would not expect so but
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much thanks for taking
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
my question do you think then it's um
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's fair to uh to move forward with
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
this while other teachers may have been
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.069 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i get
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
one point remember some years ago on the
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
committee would pass the bill allowing
 
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
students to take
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
courses and then they'd get credit for
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
those courses in high school if they
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
were taking a lower grade i remember in
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
our high school
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
algebra for example in the eighth grade
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
and spanish
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
and taken in the eighth grade was the
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
same course as taking in the ninth grade
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
the same books and everything and so i
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
remember when i was on the school board
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
because it was law we passed it so that
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
those students can get the credit for
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
what they took in the eighth grade and i
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
know londonderry even starts soon in the
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
seventh grade they can take algebra in
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
the eighth grade they can take geometry
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
so i mean depending on the student they
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
have to meet the qualification so yeah i
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
think this is
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
probably a good bill and probably being
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
done already so but for the loan
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
forgiveness yeah i think it's fair just
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.389 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
represent milo uh thank you mr chair
 
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's more of a statement i think
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
than a question
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
and it's a follow-up to uh
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative luna's statement
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
i think the loan forgiveness is a good
 
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.430 align:start position:0%
i think the loan forgiveness is a good
program

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
the dilemma is is that you've got other
 
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.190 align:start position:0%
the dilemma is is that you've got other
teachers

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
that are also teaching kids
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
and you've got elementary teachers who
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
are providing a
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
a baseline for learning math for example
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
and yet they get no credit for that
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
so this is not a criticism
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
of the amendment here
 
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
but it's a criticism of the policy
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
that you take a section of teachers
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
and you say okay
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
you can have a special deal here but the
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
others can't
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
and i think i object to the theory
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
take a particular group of teachers and
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
provide them with preferential treatment
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
rather than dealing with teachers in
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
general that provide the foundation
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
for math etc so that's that's really
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
more of a criticism
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
for the concept of
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
segmenting out certain people to get
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
certain things and not recognizing the
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
value of others by giving them the same
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
benefit so it's just a statement thank
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
um uh and i expect um uh if
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative hill makes it here he's
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
been uh very involved in in this issue
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
um he uh i'm sure would be uh glad to
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
what's up thank you i don't know if
 
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's for you for you is the chair or
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative cordelia can you explain
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
what n h h e a f the supplemental piece
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
what that organization is supplemental
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
um i i am not sure what the acronym
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
stands for uh perhaps uh representative
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
hill is aware of that um i was trying to
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure okay
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much mr chair i
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
believe it stands for new hampshire
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
higher education assistance foundation
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
and it
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
i think traditionally
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
involves itself in
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
in fafsa completion student fafsa
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
completion for
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
sophomores and juniors in in high school
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
and it also advises students and
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
families on their uh their ability to um
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
to obtain um uh uh loans and and
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
scholarships for higher education great
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your clarification
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question i'm
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
just wondering about certification
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
versus what you teach
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
so if you were an eighth grade algebra
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
teacher and you were certified in
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
elementary ed
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
but you're teaching you've you've been
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
hired to teach the algebra class are you
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
still qualified or not is it it looks
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
like it's not based on certification but
 
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.189 align:start position:0%
like it's not based on certification but
rather

00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
rather
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
if you have a bachelor's degree
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
and you are teaching the science is that
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
right or
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
do we know that uh
 
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.550 align:start position:0%
do we know that uh
i'm

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
not sure of that but um
 
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:23.990 align:start position:0%
not sure of that but um
uh

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
you know it it seems that um there are
 
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.350 align:start position:0%
you know it it seems that um there are
uh

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
subjects that are um
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
offered um both in high school and in
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
the upper
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
middle school if you will or
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
in within any secondary that basically
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
so if i'm not certified in mathematics
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
but i am a certified teacher i have
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
a bachelor's degree in elementary ed
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
and i've been hired to teach that i
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
would get the long forgiveness do you
 
00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:58.550 align:start position:0%
would get the long forgiveness do you
think

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh i am not that familiar with the
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
provisions of the loan forgiveness
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
any more questions
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and i guess we'll recess
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
for a few minutes and see if we can find
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
greg hill
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
i know senator kahn is in
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
the education committee downstairs in
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
the senate i was just there
 
00:17:20.559 --> 00:30:16.789 align:start position:0%
the senate i was just there
so

00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
well representative hill to speak on
 
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.630 align:start position:0%
well representative hill to speak on
232.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
232.
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you i hope i didn't hold anyone up
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
well i apologize
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
to everyone
 
00:30:31.679 --> 00:30:32.470 align:start position:0%
to everyone
um

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
i'm here on to speak on a uh an
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to 236
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
mostly to explain the situation that
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
happened in my school district
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
as most of us
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
are aware
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
often times when you hear a story from a
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
constituent that just sounds so crazy
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
it you find out
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
generally it is crazy and there's a
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
important piece missing
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
in this case it wasn't um it is crazy as
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
far as i can see
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
the situation was
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
in winter swamp school district
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
we had three math teachers
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
they applied for
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
loans for
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
education continuing education
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
two of them applied with one lender
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
one of them applied with a different
 
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.750 align:start position:0%
one of them applied with a different
lender

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
lender
 
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
when it came to the teacher forgiveness
 
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.990 align:start position:0%
when it came to the teacher forgiveness
program

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
the two that applied with one lender
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
that lender looked at our statutes
 
00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:39.990 align:start position:0%
that lender looked at our statutes
and

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.590 align:start position:0%
and
deemed

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
deemed
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement to be
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
based on a
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
high school level
 
00:31:49.039 --> 00:31:50.389 align:start position:0%
high school level
or

00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
secondary level
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
they paid or reimbursed seventeen
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
the one teacher that chose a different
 
00:32:00.799 --> 00:32:02.470 align:start position:0%
the one teacher that chose a different
carrier

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
carrier
 
00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.590 align:start position:0%
carrier
their

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
legal team looked at our statutes
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
and had an opposite view and said that
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
they were
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
a primary or
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
elementary school
 
00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.830 align:start position:0%
elementary school
teacher

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
and they will reimburse five thousand
 
00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.350 align:start position:0%
and they will reimburse five thousand
dollars

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.070 align:start position:0%
dollars
so

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
all this amendment does
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
is say for purposes of the teacher loan
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
forgiveness program
 
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
k through 6
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
will be considered elementary school
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
7 through 12 will be considered
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
a secondary school
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
and that's all it does
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
it allows
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
you know we have letter upon letter here
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
from the superintendent who's saying it
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
really doesn't matter they're all
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
teaching in 8th grade
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
this high school
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
level math so they should be here they
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
went as far as
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
to the u.s department of education and
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
because our statutes in different areas
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
refer to
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
those grades
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
in an ambiguous way or in different
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
sections one way or another rather than
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
try to change those different sections
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
it just made sense for them to have
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
something to point to as c for purposes
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
of this this is the legislative intent
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll be happy to answer any
 
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.630 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll be happy to answer any
questions

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
very much representative hill for taking
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
my question you mentioned that the
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
particular teachers in question were
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
teaching high school level math in
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
eighth grade
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
in that school are you aware of any
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
eighth grade math teachers who are not
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
teaching high school level math and
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
would would otherwise
 
00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.630 align:start position:0%
would would otherwise
maybe

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
not feel that they were entitled to the
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
seventeen thousand five hundred dollars
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
in federal loan forgiveness
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative i i am not aware
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
um two things i'm not aware that they
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
were exclusively teaching
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
what we would call high school math
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
i'm only going by
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
the description that was sent to the
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
and from the testimony that i've given
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
you from
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
the teacher herself
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it was exclusively
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
one way or the other i think they do
 
00:34:31.359 --> 00:34:33.030 align:start position:0%
one way or the other i think they do
incorporate

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
incorporate
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
i think they say here pre-algebra as
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
well as algebra 1 classes so
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
for me i consider algebra 1
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
high school and pre-algebra i consider
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
8th grade but i may be wrong
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much um and and as a
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
as a as a follow-up then uh is there a
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
distinction to be made among
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
let's say seventh and eighth grade
 
00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.230 align:start position:0%
let's say seventh and eighth grade
teachers

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.030 align:start position:0%
teachers
who

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
may not be teaching
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
high school level math courses or
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
science courses and i'm not i'm not
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
trying to talk about exclusively
 
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.910 align:start position:0%
trying to talk about exclusively
teaching

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
teaching
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
high school math and science but ones
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
who don't teach any high school level
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
math and science like for instance
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
some schools might have a class called
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
seventh grade math
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
and um and maybe i'm a math teacher at
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
one of those schools and i teach
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
seventh grade math i teach um um
 
00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.069 align:start position:0%
seventh grade math i teach um um
um

00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
let me just say three you know three
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
blocks of seventh grade math uh every
 
00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.109 align:start position:0%
blocks of seventh grade math uh every
day

00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:37.990 align:start position:0%
day
um

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh and i don't teach anything else uh
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
would would would that teacher feel that
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
that they met the
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
requirements of this section or the
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
section is amended for um uh to be
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
considered to be a high school teacher
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to figure out what what
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
motivated these teachers
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
to to want to make this distinction and
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's being being applied
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
and and i guess how it's being applied
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
in this thank you for your question um
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
if i understand it correctly
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure that that the
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
committee is aware this is not just
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
um science and math
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
teachers um this is
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment speaks only to
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
7th through 12th being considered
 
00:36:30.079 --> 00:36:31.589 align:start position:0%
7th through 12th being considered
secondary

00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
secondary
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of the subject matter that
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
you're teaching 7th through 12th
 
00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.190 align:start position:0%
you're teaching 7th through 12th
and

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
k through
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
6 being considered
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
um elementary that's all it does and
 
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.190 align:start position:0%
um elementary that's all it does and
that

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
and the reason i think it's simpler to
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
do it that way
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
is because that's what this program that
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
that reimburses
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
deals with it doesn't deal with
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
the subject matter in any way shape or
 
00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.990 align:start position:0%
the subject matter in any way shape or
form

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't there's no distinction
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
that i've seen in any of these teacher
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
forgiveness programs that we have here
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
from any of the
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
lending institutions
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not talking about
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
what's what's taught or
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
what percentage or by whom
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
any other questions represent tana
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
question so there's no um
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
so this is basically a federal program
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
that we don't have at the state level
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
but we have state
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
financial institutions that deal with
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
student loans
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
who are making different decisions and
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make it equal is that
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
would that be a good summary of what
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
i think you should have been the one
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
testifying representative thank you very
 
00:37:53.839 --> 00:37:54.870 align:start position:0%
testifying representative thank you very
much

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
that says it perfectly
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions seeing none on
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
the close the hearing on
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
sb 236. thank you and we're going to
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
this uh amendment um has come about
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
based on a contact i had with a
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
counselor a couple of months ago
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
and it relates to a
 
00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:54.069 align:start position:0%
and it relates to a
federal

00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
grant program
 
00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.710 align:start position:0%
grant program
that

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
is being piloted in a number of
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
districts in new hampshire
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%

this
program

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
relates to
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
student behavioral and and wellness
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
issues and
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
as part of the
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
requirements of the program
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
counselors are required to enter into a
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
third-party database
 
00:39:27.119 --> 00:39:27.990 align:start position:0%
third-party database
um

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information

about students
 
00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.589 align:start position:0%
about students
including

00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
a name address sacid
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
and other behavioral issues i believe
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
if a counselor sees a student more than
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
once they are supposed to enter
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
information into this database
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
for tracking of
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
the counselor
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
feels that uh this is in violation of um
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
her ethical standards
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
as a member of the counselor profession
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%

obligation regarding confidentiality
 
00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:26.319 align:start position:0%

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
i i won't go against the
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
department of education lawyers but i
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
think that they're probably correct in
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
that it does not
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
violate ferpa
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
but the councilor still feels that it
 
00:42:47.839 --> 00:42:48.630 align:start position:0%
but the councilor still feels that it
has

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
it's a violation of her ethical
 
00:42:50.319 --> 00:42:52.950 align:start position:0%
it's a violation of her ethical
standards

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
and so she has since
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
recently resigned
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
her position in the school which
 
00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.030 align:start position:0%
her position in the school which
is

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
tears her up
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
the department of education is working
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
with the third party that services
 
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
multiple districts
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh to see if they can scale back uh the
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
amount of uh personally identifiable
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
not realizing that i can do much about
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%

uh that
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh the department um is aware of this

and does not see any uh legal difficulty
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
um with this
 
00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:03.829 align:start position:0%
um with this
um

00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
in that uh the information is still
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
being uh provided to the third party in
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
line with ferpa but we're just notifying
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
the parents that this has occurred and i
 
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.829 align:start position:0%
the parents that this has occurred and i
think

00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know we've talked about
 
00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.870 align:start position:0%
you know we've talked about
parental

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
parental
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
engagement and so forth quite often uh
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
this year in this committee
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
so i think that this is um
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
the least we can do in this situation
 
00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:30.710 align:start position:0%
the least we can do in this situation
um

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
and uh i would uh ask for your support
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you any questions

thank you i i kind of feel like i'm
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
working behind the curtain
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
because i don't know
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
who are the third party people
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
and what kind of
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
surveys and and you know all the things
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
that that that this might actually
 
00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.630 align:start position:0%
that that that this might actually
um

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
impede i'm wondering if the youth risk
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
behavioral survey for example is one of
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
the ones where
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
student information is uh given to a
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
you know i i would just like
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
more detail
 
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh before i make this you know decision
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
wide-ranging bill
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
or amendment thank you um yeah i think
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
surveys are covered under a different
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
section of federal statute and um we're
 
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
not talking about surveys they're
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
actually entering this information into

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
i thought i
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
might have to look back
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
but there are a number of exceptions
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
um that i i didn't
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
know uh mentioned in my testimony
 
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.790 align:start position:0%
know uh mentioned in my testimony
um

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
but i i have part of and this is
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
exciting wrong
 
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.950 align:start position:0%
exciting wrong
follow-up

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
i can get you the ferpa no i'm i'm
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
actually looking at it it's a rhetorical
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
question okay that includes state and
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
local authorities within the juvenile
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
justice system and so my follow-up
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
question to that is
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
um uh what um um sort of implications do
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
you think um disclosure to um uh to a to
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
a parent
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
um uh could have
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
in uh in a case where uh where state and
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
local authorities within a juvenile
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
justice system are
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
are being involved and have you
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
explored exhaustively just explored
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
what that impact
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
on on the families and the student and
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
i'd like to hear your comments on that
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
i i think that
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
parents have a right
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
to know
 
00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.790 align:start position:0%
to know
generally

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
generally
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
their they're kids
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
so um if the school is providing uh
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
information on their students to a third
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
someone in the juvenile justice system
 
00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:38.470 align:start position:0%
someone in the juvenile justice system
or

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.390 align:start position:0%
or
elsewhere

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
we've had legislation in the past
 
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.670 align:start position:0%
we've had legislation in the past
about

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
law enforcement being called on students
 
00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:55.910 align:start position:0%
law enforcement being called on students
um

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
and whether parents should have the
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
right to know that that is
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
and i come down on the side that
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
um so thank you and um and uh could you
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
comment a little bit on on where maybe
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
reported to the police are you saying or
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
two authorities
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:36.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:36.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:38.549 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
i think that um
 
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.790 align:start position:0%
i think that um
uh

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
if there is
 
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.950 align:start position:0%
if there is
um

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
let me backtrack
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
this is information that's being entered
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
into a third
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
party database uh nothing is being hap
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
happening with that uh information and
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
the third part by the third party
 
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding is if the third party
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
is presenting
 
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.910 align:start position:0%
is presenting
information

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
a referral
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
to another agency
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
that parental consent
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
is obtained
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
in that case so if the third party in
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
this case
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
presenting that information uh let's say
 
00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:25.510 align:start position:0%
presenting that information uh let's say
to

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
um a psychologist or something that the
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
parent would be notified
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
just to be really specific on on this
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
this is about disclosure by the school
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
to a third party so it's not a third
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
party database
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
and and this is about exceptions from
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
the consent requirement and what i'm
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
hearing you suggest is that under no
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances should should there be any
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
exception whatsoever to the consent
 
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.670 align:start position:0%
exception whatsoever to the consent
requirement

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
that a student's personally identifiable
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
data so it's not necessarily talking
 
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
about their grades it's not necessarily
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
their full record but it's talking about
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
anything that qualifies as personally
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
identifiable data within a student's
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
record um maintained by the the lea
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
disclosed to a third party
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the exceptions that are that
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
are that are detailed under federal law
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
of which one of them is state and local
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
authorities within a juvenile justice
 
00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.990 align:start position:0%
authorities within a juvenile justice
system

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
and there are others too
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
um that that you don't see any i
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
what you're saying you don't see any
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
situation where any exception
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
should be made that any parent should
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
receive disclosure so that such
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
non-consent disclosure has been made
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
is that your testimony
 
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.109 align:start position:0%
is that your testimony
if

00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.190 align:start position:0%
the school district
is

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
providing identifiable information
 
00:51:04.079 --> 00:51:05.270 align:start position:0%
providing identifiable information
to

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
a juvenile
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
facility juvenile justice
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
law enforcement let's say
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
i think that the parents have a right to
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:22.870 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.829 align:start position:0%
if
the

00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh information is being disclosed um i
 
00:51:27.599 --> 00:51:29.750 align:start position:0%
uh information is being disclosed um i
think

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
in any event the uh schools should be
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
talking with the parents about um what
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
is going on um at home um if that's
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
the area of your concern
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
but i i think that
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
so i've been sitting here doing a little
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
legal research putting on my legal hat
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
and it turns out that federal law
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
trumps state law when it comes to ferpa
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
that under the supremacy clause federal
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
law always trumps state law
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
most of the cases have to do with
 
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.870 align:start position:0%
most of the cases have to do with
disclosure

00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
not with
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
notification like you're proposing but i
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
think it raises this is lawyer talk i'm
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
probably gonna drive you all nuts but i
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
think it it raises a valid question as
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
to whether what you're doing violates
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
the supremacy clause
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
and i think it may be putting us in a
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
precarious position
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
um if we choose to go forward with this
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
amendment given there's multiple state
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
cases that i'm finding here as i sit
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
here and look this up from all over the
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
country with over and over again state
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
courts and federal courts finding that
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
under the supremacy clause ferpa trumps
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
state law and all these issues
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
so my question is are you concerned
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
i i believe that um
 
00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.150 align:start position:0%
i i believe that um
uh

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
that this law
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment um deals with
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
just parental notification
 
00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.549 align:start position:0%
just parental notification
um

00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
it does not block the release of that
 
00:53:15.119 --> 00:53:16.309 align:start position:0%
it does not block the release of that
information

00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
um under ferpa at all um
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
i i do not see
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh a problem
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
but uh but uh there again i'm not a
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
lawyer so in the case that
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
representative luna was talking about
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
that if you've got a case of abuse going
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
on say for example say you've got a
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
father abusing his daughter and they
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
want the school records from the
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
counselor and they're going to notify
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
the father of this it seems to me that
 
00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
that could be a problem interfering in
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
the case
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
and certainly we've seen those kinds of
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
things happen all my years on child and
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
family law i certainly heard about those
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
kinds of things happening so i think one
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
of the perhaps unintended consequences
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
here may be that we're interfering with
 
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.390 align:start position:0%
here may be that we're interfering with
normal

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
normal
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
processes to protect children and i'm
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
you have given that much thought and the
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.549 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:54:20.559 --> 00:54:22.150 align:start position:0%
question
if

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
law enforcement was contacted i thought
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
i would think that law enforcement would
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
be doing
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
an investigation and a part of that
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
investigation would be contacting the
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
i think the timing is an issue at this
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
point you know i think law enforcement
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
does things on their own schedule where
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
they may want the records before they
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
contact the parent
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
in that case
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
so i think you know we're having i think
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
that this has unintended consequences of
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
things that haven't been thought through
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
because this is based on one anecdotal
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
situation and i'm wondering if you've
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
had other situations or thought about
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
other unintended consequences of trying
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
to do legislation based on one anecdotal
 
00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:08.150 align:start position:0%
to do legislation based on one anecdotal
situation

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
i think it is more than one anecdotal
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
situation and that this is
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
occurring in
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
a number of school districts
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
the same process is occurring in a
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
number of school districts in the state
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
and around the country
 
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
so i believe it's more than one
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
anecdotal situation
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative milo
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
um your statement that
 
00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.270 align:start position:0%
um your statement that
regardless

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
parents should be notified
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
and i would have a question i guess if i
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
was a counselor
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
dealing with confidential information
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
whether it be about abuse whether it be
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
about sexual orientation
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
etc where you have
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
a direct relationship with the student
 
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
that may be contrary to what the parents
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
believe in or what they
 
00:56:08.799 --> 00:56:10.069 align:start position:0%
believe in or what they
want

00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
and yet this would basically say
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of what that confidential
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
conversation you might have with a child
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
but that information
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
if it's transferred to a third party
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
must be
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
given to a parent
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
do you have any concern about that as it
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
relates the impact that it might have on
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
the child
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
relate to issues that they may not be
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
aware of that the child is fearful of
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
from the parents
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
i think there are also
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
many instances
 
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
perhaps

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
information is being
 
00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.990 align:start position:0%
information is being
kept

00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
kept
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
by the school
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
from parents
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
that should be
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's what you and i would disagree
 
00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.950 align:start position:0%
that's what you and i would disagree
with

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
any more questions
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
remember that woodcut
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you to chairman uh reverend
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
connelly thank you for
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully answering my question um
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully yeah
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at this more of the
 
00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.309 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at this more of the
process

00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
in line 25 you're talking the detailed
 
00:57:24.559 --> 00:57:26.710 align:start position:0%
in line 25 you're talking the detailed
records

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
shall be included
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
there there should be information put in
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
the student's educational record
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
about the disclosure of this information
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
but you said but the word detail record
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
pre-exacting versus
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
i met with attorney walsh discussed
 
00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.190 align:start position:0%
i met with attorney walsh discussed
something

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
or met she received information
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be a detailed wreck of
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
what but we talked and she reviewed the
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
records of student
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
steve all right
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
what details are we putting that record
 
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.589 align:start position:0%
what details are we putting that record
um

00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
it has to be more than just the date of
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
the disclosure but there has to be more
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
information provided in the student
 
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:18.390 align:start position:0%
information provided in the student
record

00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
in line with the information that right
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
above that in one was provided to the
 
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.430 align:start position:0%
above that in one was provided to the
parents

00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay so that that doesn't really explain
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
what detailed is but okay so
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
my fault mr chair
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um going back to
 
00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.630 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um going back to
um

00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
line 22 then number 23
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
it says the parents shall be informed to
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
whom to be released and the purpose
 
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
what is what does that mean the parent
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
shall be informed
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh parents shall be contacted it could
 
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:54.150 align:start position:0%
uh parents shall be contacted it could
be

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
a phone call it could be in writing so
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
if if
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
using the same scenario before
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
attorney walt came in to check on uh
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
student steve because of something that
 
00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
was was uh relevant
 
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
as a third party
 
00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:14.470 align:start position:0%
as a third party
so

00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
a call from the school saying from the
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
council that the attorneys came in
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
that's it that that's informed or it has
 
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
to be and it doesn't just my question
 
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
i don't want to for me and then the
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
inform doesn't line up with detail
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
and inform is as you said could be a
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
call could be a talk of an email so or
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
but then you have details those two
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
words and in the data that conversation
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
can concern me right now
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
can so
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i i don't see any um problem
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
between one and two there um it uh
 
00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:49.030 align:start position:0%
between one and two there um it uh
outlines

00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
outlines
 
00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:49.829 align:start position:0%
outlines
uh

00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
three things that uh the parents to be
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
are to be informed of i would say that
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
would be at least um
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh provided for in uh
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
in two
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you it doesn't really
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
tell you what they're being formed how
 
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
to be informed what extent being formed
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and finally my last question on line
 
01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.630 align:start position:0%
um and finally my last question on line
24

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
24
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
what happens if the information was not
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
if the information wasn't does it have
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
to be released
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
if attorney walt's investigating stevie
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
for as perhaps have a counselor have
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
referred to for abuse or
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
or uh something else
 
01:00:34.559 --> 01:00:35.510 align:start position:0%
or uh something else
um

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
does that information have to be if it's
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
not educational do they have to be
 
01:00:38.079 --> 01:00:39.589 align:start position:0%
not educational do they have to be
released

01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
released
 
01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
if there is an educational purpose that
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
specified but if there was if there was
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
a behavioral issue um in in this case
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
with these grants um they could be
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
behavioral issues um that would be
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
required to be entered into the uh third
 
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
party database this says in the
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
educational purpose for which the
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
information will be used my question is
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
if there is not an educational purpose
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
does this information have to be
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
disclosed to the parent yes
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
so all information if there is a third
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
release that information has to be
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
provided yes even if it's not
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
educational yes
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
question sure
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli can you imagine
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
any situation where it would be in the
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
if you are providing information to a
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
it should be the duty of the school to
 
01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.309 align:start position:0%
it should be the duty of the school to
also

01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
provide it to the parent
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
parents can't be left out of the
 
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.470 align:start position:0%
parents can't be left out of the
equation

01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
so you see
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
or you imagine that there is no
 
01:02:02.559 --> 01:02:04.069 align:start position:0%
or you imagine that there is no
circumstance

01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
that it is in the best interest of the
 
01:02:06.079 --> 01:02:07.510 align:start position:0%
that it is in the best interest of the
child

01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
there could be a whole slew of
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
hypothetical situations that
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know if i can uh
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
think of at this point but
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
there could be
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
various hypothetical situations
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
one more fellow
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't that be an unintended
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
consequence though that that if we're
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
really concerned about the best interest
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
of the child
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
and we know
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
that in certain circumstances
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
certain parents and and again
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
these are i assume these are parents
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
rather than guardians so somebody may be
 
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
a guardian of a child
 
01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.589 align:start position:0%
a guardian of a child
and

01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
a good reason why they're guarding the
 
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
child and not
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
specifically the parent
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
and yet the parent is being
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh advised of of
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
what is happening can you see that
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility problem there
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
since we're working on anecdotal cases
 
01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.710 align:start position:0%
since we're working on anecdotal cases
here

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
um you know i think hypothetical and
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
anecdotal kind of
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
near each other in some instances well i
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
i think here
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
it's not anecdotal these situations are
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
occurring on a daily basis in a number
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
of our schools so i don't consider it
 
01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.670 align:start position:0%
of our schools so i don't consider it
anecdotal

01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
not to be argumentative
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
although it seems like it's getting to
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
that point
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
my question again is that this is parent
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
and we have guardians
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
we have grandparents who are having kids
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
because they're the parents are
 
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
incapacitated perhaps maybe to drug
 
01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.390 align:start position:0%
incapacitated perhaps maybe to drug
abuse

01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.910 align:start position:0%
abuse
and

01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
in with this particular amendment you're
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
saying that that parent
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
has to be notified
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
if there's and particularly in mental
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
health issues i believe
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
if if a child has been talking to a
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
counselor and a mental health person
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
third party uh needs some information or
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
or the police need some information um
 
01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:15.670 align:start position:0%
or the police need some information um
by

01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
having just the parents in this this
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
amendment you've you've really set up a
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
situation that could be
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
if you would like the best interest of
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
the job if you would like to amend this
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
and include um guardians i would have no
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
problem with that
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
last question right we have them
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i don't know if
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
this is going to be the last question or
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
not but um but how would this read in
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
terms of a um
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
a school that contracts with a um a
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
third-party cloud-based student
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
information system
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
where grades are updated on a daily
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
basis with that with that with that
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
third party um uh system and would that
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
be considered a
 
01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.710 align:start position:0%
be considered a
um

01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.150 align:start position:0%
um
a

01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
currently an exempt
 
01:05:04.799 --> 01:05:05.990 align:start position:0%
currently an exempt
disclosure

01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
under ferpa uh including school
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
officials with legitimate educational
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
interests or organizations conducting
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
studies or work on behalf of
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
of the school
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
and um and i guess the follow-up to that
 
01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
what would you envision if parental
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
notification and then and then
 
01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.349 align:start position:0%
notification and then and then
filing

01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
filing
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
notice into the into the file in such a
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
case where had to be done every time
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
data in the student information system
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
was updated what that would cost in
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
local and uh and state resources and do
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
we even get into sort of like a chasing
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
your tail situation where if you're now
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
updating the system to show
 
01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.069 align:start position:0%
updating the system to show
that

01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
a notification that the system was
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
updated that you would then have to
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
notify the system again
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
in a
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
in a situation that really really is
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
chasing the tale but i'd be very
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
in your your um your your
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
your position with respect to
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
third-party student information systems
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
and frankly your position uh with
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
respect to the new hampshire doe in um
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
in sharing personally identifiable
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
information including students and
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
families addresses with the department
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
and whether whether that would
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
fall under this thank you
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh i i believe we have other statutes
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
that come into play and i don't remember
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
the rsa number
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
for instance with
 
01:06:39.119 --> 01:06:39.990 align:start position:0%
for instance with
the

01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
company that's doing the statewide
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
assessment there are other statutes that
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
come into play with that
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that would fall
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
underneath that under this
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what
 
01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.510 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what
pardon

01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
pardon
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
the question is how could it not
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
student officials would legitimate um uh
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
with legitimate educational interest i
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
mean how could it not fall under the
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
staff but there are provisions um with
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
the statewide assessment for what
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
information what personally identifiable
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
information is provided there's not a
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
lot of personally identifiable
 
01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.710 align:start position:0%
lot of personally identifiable
information

01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
provided to that third-party company
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
and what is allowed is in statute in
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay one more this is that
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.270 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.630 align:start position:0%
uh
something

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
they're 18 years of old
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
they're they're
 
01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.630 align:start position:0%
they're they're
um

01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
they're in charge of their records
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
basically but they're still in a public
 
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.349 align:start position:0%
basically but they're still in a public
school

01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
or in a school situation um do the
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
parents get notified
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%

we see the school board associate okay
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.189 align:start position:0%
this bill
amendment

01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:08:39.199 --> 01:08:40.149 align:start position:0%
amendment
and

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
since we're still down it's downstairs
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
and hearings
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
so we'll do a little recess and until
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know when to start the exact
 
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.309 align:start position:0%
i don't know when to start the exact
session

01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
because the senate is also having
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
hearings right now on
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
our bills
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
we tried to
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
work out with them but it didn't work
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do is that
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
we are having an appropriate fire too
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
but we couldn't do that because of the
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
head going on downstairs starting at
 
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
so we're going to break right now for a
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
short caucus hopefully it's short
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
they're still on the second bill down in
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
center head
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
was still online yeah still on that bill
 
01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.950 align:start position:0%
was still online yeah still on that bill
and

01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
there's some folks down there waiting to
 
01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.510 align:start position:0%
there's some folks down there waiting to
speak

01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
on bills to come up
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
there's not as many people in line for
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
those bills though so those should go
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully faster
 
01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.110 align:start position:0%
hopefully faster
but

01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know what transpired during the
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
hearings this morning here
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
but if there is need for a caucus this
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
would be the time to do it
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
before we get together
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's based on what senator ward's doing
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
down there and it's they're just
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
dragging so i would say at least a half
 
01:10:03.679 --> 01:10:05.350 align:start position:0%
dragging so i would say at least a half
hour

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
hour
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
unless somebody wanted to make tied into
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
now i'm open to you know what what
 
01:10:16.719 --> 01:10:18.070 align:start position:0%
now i'm open to you know what what
what's

01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
what's
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
well you might be able to talk about
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
there's five remaining bills as well
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
and dave and i talked this morning on
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
there might be two areas which you can
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
do some discussion

02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
did representatives you your initial
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
motion was that
 
02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:33.679 --> 02:03:34.390 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:35.589 align:start position:0%
i
was

02:03:35.589 --> 02:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:03:36.629 --> 02:03:36.639 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
in all honesty i was not here when i was
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
assigned to the duty so i was wondering
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
if potentially someone
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
could speak to uh make a motion on the
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
bill and i could make a motion on the
 
02:03:54.159 --> 02:03:55.669 align:start position:0%
bill and i could make a motion on the
amendment

02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
so what we need is we need a motion on
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
and then after we have a second on that
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
then we can bring forward the
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
non-germane amendment
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
we need to do it in the proper order so
 
02:04:09.109 --> 02:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
any any kind of motions that we had
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
previously made let's start over and uh
 
02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:13.760 align:start position:0%

02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
motion oh uh i will rescind my ought to
 
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:19.840 align:start position:0%

base makes waste right
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%

i i don't have anything to add thank you
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
on the amendment no we haven't we've
 
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
just we're just on the main bill
 
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
yeah this this is an important piece
 
02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:33.189 align:start position:0%
yeah this this is an important piece
because

02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
as an example as i was driving back uh
 
02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
over the holidays
 
02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:40.719 align:start position:0%
i come by i think it was new haven
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
and there's this big billboard out there
 
02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
for encouraging people
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
to become a teacher
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
with incent with the con with the
 
02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:51.679 align:start position:0%
financial incentive
 
02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
so this is happening all over the
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
country it's happening in this state and
 
02:05:58.229 --> 02:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
i think this will give us an opportunity
 
02:06:00.310 --> 02:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
to really look to see what the shortage
 
02:06:02.790 --> 02:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
is and what are some alternatives
 
02:06:05.270 --> 02:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
to include people who may want to become
 
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
teachers in the future
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
and and i would like to tack on to what
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative meyer just said uh while
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
i was downstairs at the senate this
 
02:06:13.199 --> 02:06:14.550 align:start position:0%
i was downstairs at the senate this
morning

02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discussion in the
 
02:06:18.149 --> 02:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
hallway with the
 
02:06:20.709 --> 02:06:20.719 align:start position:0%
chair of the state board of education
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
and the department also recognizes the
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
shortage we have in both elementary and
 
02:06:28.709 --> 02:06:28.719 align:start position:0%
secondary teachers and specialists in
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
this state and there's a lot of
 
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
competition out there as you all know
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
with those that come out with the
 
02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
content areas and especially the stem
 
02:06:37.119 --> 02:06:38.390 align:start position:0%
content areas and especially the stem
areas

02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
areas
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
and and in specialty areas from industry
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
which is able to really you know double
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
payment or triple the pay that you would
 
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
get as a teacher
 
02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
and people wisely are saying that's
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
where my future is and i need those
 
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
dollars and they're opting to go
 
02:06:55.910 --> 02:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
elsewhere we're also seeing as a result
 
02:06:58.069 --> 02:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic and what we had in the
 
02:07:01.109 --> 02:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
last two years there's burnout there's
 
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
also um
 
02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
it's not the same and folks are dealing
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
with uh they're exhausted uh
 
02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
as in and you also have issues coming in
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
with sickness
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
and so with that people are opting
 
02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
either to retire early or to
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
to leave for another what they may think
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
is a greener pasture
 
02:07:25.750 --> 02:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
and we are short to begin with with
 
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
specialists in areas special education
 
02:07:29.350 --> 02:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
especially with physical therapy and
 
02:07:32.629 --> 02:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
speech pathology and and orthopedic and
 
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
and uh blindness and deaf etc and and
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
those people are also going to work at
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
the hospital level where they're getting
 
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
a number of opportunities there and
 
02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:45.350 align:start position:0%
a number of opportunities there and
again

02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
a difference in pace so the incentives
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
and the need to be looking at teacher
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
shortage issue is very real
 
02:07:55.189 --> 02:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
and the department right now is also
 
02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
looking that at this whole topic right
 
02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
now with groups over there looking at
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
the area certification alternative
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
routes looking licensure etc so
 
02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
the need for this is is real so that's
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's my two cents worth
 
02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:11.910 align:start position:0%
that's my two cents worth
um

02:08:11.910 --> 02:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
reps and hobson do you have a further
 
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:14.960 align:start position:0%

reimbursement rates
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%

02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
was in the state of new hampshire they
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%

so um i'd like to take a
 
02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
half hour break here and maybe we have
 
02:16:17.910 --> 02:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
our lunch come back and wipe this thing
 
02:16:19.750 --> 02:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
out very quickly and we can be out of
 
02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
here by
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
i would hope by one
 
02:16:27.030 --> 02:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
by one o'clock or 1 30 at the latest
 
02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:29.830 align:start position:0%
by one o'clock or 1 30 at the latest
perhaps

02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
yeah okay perhaps before you take the
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
trouble of going to the speaker you
 
02:16:34.870 --> 02:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
might want to find out if there's enough
 
02:16:36.150 --> 02:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
support in the room for the amendment to
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
begin with because if the amendment's
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
going to fail you don't need to talk to
 
02:16:41.110 --> 02:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
the speaker
 
02:16:42.469 --> 02:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
yeah but i got to find out what the
 
02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
amendment's going to say too
 
02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
so i i what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
 
02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
just take you know this this
 
02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
you know maybe come back at you know
 
02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
one o'clock and then
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
get it done
 
02:16:58.469 --> 02:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
mr chair are you talking about an
 
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
amendment on 386 as well
 
02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:03.509 align:start position:0%
amendment on 386 as well
um

02:17:03.509 --> 02:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything on 386 that i have
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
do you
 
02:17:11.509 --> 02:17:11.519 align:start position:0%
know are there any amendments on 386
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
represent luna not that i'm aware of
 
02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
so can we exact that now
 
02:17:20.709 --> 02:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
oh that this this is the um this is a
 
02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
technical change that's that we were all
 
02:17:25.030 --> 02:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
in the admins
 
02:17:26.950 --> 02:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
this is no problem with the 386 is going
 
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
to fly either way so
 
02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
so we could jump and do 386 so we can go
 
02:17:32.150 --> 02:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
up get the clarification on that i'll
 
02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
come back and take care of it great
 
02:17:36.549 --> 02:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
okay let's uh jump to 386 relative to
 
02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
the determination of state adequate
 
02:17:40.469 --> 02:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
education grants and charter public
 
02:17:43.990 --> 02:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:46.950 --> 02:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move out to pass
 
02:17:49.030 --> 02:17:49.040 align:start position:0%

02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:54.800 align:start position:0%

of the motion
 
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:07.760 align:start position:0%

02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:39.509 align:start position:0%
 
until

02:19:39.519 --> 02:19:40.870 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:04:39.030 --> 03:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:41.269 --> 03:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
okay i'd like to go ahead so
 
03:04:43.510 --> 03:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
we can
 
03:04:45.750 --> 03:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
tackle what we have to tackle here
 
03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh sb 352
 
03:04:50.550 --> 03:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh this is a bill relative substitute
 
03:04:52.230 --> 03:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
teacher criminal history record checks
 
03:04:53.429 --> 03:04:53.439 align:start position:0%
and parental notification of
 
03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
confidential student information release
 
03:04:58.870 --> 03:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
we also had a non-german amendment which
 
03:05:00.469 --> 03:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
was brought forward by representative
 
03:05:00.479 --> 03:05:03.429 align:start position:0%
was brought forward by representative
cordelli

03:05:03.429 --> 03:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:05.349 --> 03:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
evidently there was a lot of discussion
 
03:05:07.429 --> 03:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
regarding this during the non-germane
 
03:05:09.590 --> 03:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
hearing on that amendment
 
03:05:11.190 --> 03:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:05:12.630 --> 03:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
03:05:15.110 --> 03:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
issues that the non-germane amendment
 
03:05:15.120 --> 03:05:16.469 align:start position:0%
issues that the non-germane amendment
proposes

03:05:16.469 --> 03:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
proposes
 
03:05:18.710 --> 03:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
to do which there are quite a lot of
 
03:05:20.870 --> 03:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
questions that are generated as a result
 
03:05:22.469 --> 03:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
of that
 
03:05:24.790 --> 03:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
i think there's questions enough there
 
03:05:26.710 --> 03:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
where it'd be inappropriate for us to
 
03:05:29.349 --> 03:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
act on that amendment today
 
03:05:32.389 --> 03:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
and to put off this action on this bill
 
03:05:34.230 --> 03:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
till next tuesday when we have the other
 
03:05:36.630 --> 03:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
three five remaining bills
 
03:05:38.550 --> 03:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
i need we need to contact both the
 
03:05:40.389 --> 03:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
03:05:42.710 --> 03:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh we need also representative cordelli
 
03:05:44.389 --> 03:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
centers uh
 
03:05:46.710 --> 03:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
interjected here that the amendment that
 
03:05:48.550 --> 03:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
he has needs
 
03:05:50.150 --> 03:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
some revision
 
03:05:51.910 --> 03:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
needs some changes
 
03:05:53.990 --> 03:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
um that in itself would mean we'd have
 
03:05:56.070 --> 03:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
to get a new amendment made
 
03:05:57.830 --> 03:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
any new amendment that comes back that's
 
03:06:00.070 --> 03:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
on that same topic after talking with a
 
03:06:03.110 --> 03:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
cleric does not need a separate hearing
 
03:06:04.870 --> 03:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
this would be an amendment which is on
 
03:06:07.190 --> 03:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
the same topic that we had here heard
 
03:06:08.309 --> 03:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
03:06:10.230 --> 03:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
and it would be simply
 
03:06:12.150 --> 03:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
brought up an executive session as we do
 
03:06:13.670 --> 03:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
any other amendment
 
03:06:15.349 --> 03:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we're ready to move
 
03:06:17.750 --> 03:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
forward with that amendment and we may
 
03:06:19.670 --> 03:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
not have any amendment but there's some
 
03:06:21.429 --> 03:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
questions that need some resolution
 
03:06:25.030 --> 03:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
before we move forward so with that
 
03:06:26.389 --> 03:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any further action
 
03:06:30.389 --> 03:06:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:34.309 --> 03:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:35.750 --> 03:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
but we don't need a motion adjourned
 
03:06:37.190 --> 03:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
we're out of here
 
03:06:39.510 --> 03:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
so that's it
 
03:06:43.750 --> 03:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
so i thank everybody for coming back um
 
03:06:45.830 --> 03:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
that leaves the six bills left on the
 
03:06:48.389 --> 03:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
dock of the 13 we had that came in from
 
03:06:50.870 --> 03:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
the senate six bills left which we would
 
03:06:53.349 --> 03:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
address next tuesday
 
03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
and those bills have to be out of
 
03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
committee by wednesday
 
03:06:58.950 --> 03:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
of that week
 
03:07:00.950 --> 03:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
so whatever is brought forward as far as
 
03:07:03.110 --> 03:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
amendments are concerned the amendments
 
03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
have to be you know
