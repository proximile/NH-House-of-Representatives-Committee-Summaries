still working on
but

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
and that is to accommodate the fact that
 
00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
early bills are due by the february 10th
 
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 align:start position:0%

so we have to have a
 
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.870 align:start position:0%
so we have to have a
[Music]

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 align:start position:0%

to the second committee
 
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
the second piece is and i sent you all
 
00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
what the
 
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
the house chief of staff sent out about
 
00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 align:start position:0%

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
online all of the
 
00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:39.750 align:start position:0%
online all of the
um

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
submitted testimony from members of the
 
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
public is going and how to to find it
 
00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 align:start position:0%
and look at it i suggest that we do that
 
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
on a fairly frequent basis
 
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
it is not all going to be downloaded and
 
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.189 align:start position:0%
it is not all going to be downloaded and
printed

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
printed
 
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
um at this point anyways
 
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.830 align:start position:0%
um at this point anyways
so

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.790 align:start position:0%
so

revenue alternatives to the road toll
 
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 align:start position:0%
for the funding of improvements to the
 
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
state highway and bridges and for the
 
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
i have two handouts
 
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
for you today one's a narrative which is
 
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
a word document and the other is a
 
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
series of slides
 
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
the series of slides is similar to
 
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
what's been passed out to you in the
 
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.949 align:start position:0%
what's been passed out to you in the
past

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
and the only difference is i had added
 
00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
the last five slides which is the result
 
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
of the 250 thousand dollar
 
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.949 align:start position:0%
of the 250 thousand dollar
study

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
match with toll credits that was done
 
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
at the end of 2019
 
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
and then into 2020 on this particular
 
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
road just
 
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
uses fee
 
00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 align:start position:0%
i don't plan to go through these
 
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
that but i
 
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:02.390 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
bringing up the date
 
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
on the slides
 
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
three to four
 
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.750 align:start position:0%
three to four
essentially

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
talks about the source of revenues for
 
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
the highway fund
 
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
and the main source is the road toll and
 
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
the next one is the registration
 
00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
and then there was a lot of other little
 
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
things gimmicks and things like that in
 
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
order to be able to support the highway
 
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.350 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.950 align:start position:0%
and
slide

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.950 align:start position:0%
 
essentially

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
told what the
 
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.070 align:start position:0%
told what the
fleet

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
fleet
 
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
miles per gallon were
 
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
as it
 
00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
changed from 2007 to 2017
 
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
it's gone up to an average of about 25
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
miles a gallon gallon
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
when you consider the entire
 
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:07.110 align:start position:0%
when you consider the entire
population

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
slide number
 
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.710 align:start position:0%
slide number
nine

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
is the cost of construction we must
 
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
remember that every year it costs more
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
to do the same amount of work whether
 
00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
it's maintaining or building or
 
00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.350 align:start position:0%
it's maintaining or building or
repairing

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
10 to 14.
 
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
and you've heard that before it's the
 
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.670 align:start position:0%
and you've heard that before it's the
condition

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
condition
 
00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
and status of the roads and bridges
 
00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 align:start position:0%
in both the state and municipalities in
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
14 is i find rather important because
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
the last part of on 14
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
that tells the number of bridges that we
 
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.029 align:start position:0%
that tells the number of bridges that we
have

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
aged 75 years of age or older
 
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
and quite high for both the state and
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
15 is what
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
have been our options to resolve
 
00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 align:start position:0%
the high funding to the highway fund
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know we could continue doing nothing
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
or we could raise the gas tax
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
and then i think you'll see
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
the result of the
 
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
study that was done
 
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.830 align:start position:0%
study that was done
that

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
just raising the gas tax is not
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
equitable to everybody
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
we could appropriate more money from the
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
general fund but
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
go ahead and try
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
i mean you have just recently but
 
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.390 align:start position:0%
the general fund
isn't

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't appreciate that
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
we could form another study commission
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
which i'm asking you to
 
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
because the study commissions that we've
 
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
had in the past
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
have indicated that we need to do
 
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
something about the highway fund
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
but in all of this
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
we ignored one thing
 
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
and that is the
 
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
environment and we we need to get the
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
environments on board
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
to support this
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
because as you can see as we go through
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
especially the last five figures
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
five last five slides why it's so
 
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.110 align:start position:0%
five last five slides why it's so
important

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
that we get the environments on board
 
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
because it will
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
slide 19
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
is essentially
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
the miles the average miles driven
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
in 2014 was 12 900 miles
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
and why that's important in
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
my studies here
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
or my proposal i use an average of 12
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:18.309 align:start position:0%

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
slide 20 to 22 essentially the road

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
it shows the
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
the number of vehicles that we have in
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
as of
 
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.110 align:start position:0%
as of
2019

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
2019
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
seven million vehicles
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
about 650 000 in the next category 20 to
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
30 000
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
20 to 30 miles per gallon
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
and then it drops off dramatically at 30
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
to 40 65 thousand
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
forty to fifty twelve thousand and
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
greater than fifty fifteen hundred and
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
no gasoline or essentially all electric
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
it also shows that
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
on the road usage fee
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
it into slots so that
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
20 miles or less
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
paid 10
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
or between 20 and 30 they paid 25
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
and etc
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
a total of 26 million dollars collected
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
and when you subtract what's retained
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
by the
 
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.030 align:start position:0%
by the
agent

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
agent
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
which is one dollar
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
for registration you have 25 000
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
and then you have to subtract twelve pro
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
twelve percent which goes back to the
 
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.509 align:start position:0%
twelve percent which goes back to the
municipalities

00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
20 will show you
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
after you pay the 3 million dollars to
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
the municipality you'll have 22 million
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
dollars left
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
which will be the net to the highway
 
00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
fund for roads and bridges
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
and then this just
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
shows to the right of that shows what
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
happens 22 23 and 24
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
with a minor increases
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
now if you go to
 
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
which is the new one
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
and this is the result of the
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
quarter of a million dollar study
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
that was done
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
in the end of 19 and into 20.
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
it shows and it was done on the road
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
usage fee concept
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
explained in this
 
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.350 align:start position:0%
explained in this
handout

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
handout
 
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.350 align:start position:0%
handout
that

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
if you continue doing nothing
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
that you can see a drop off in the
 
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.509 align:start position:0%
that you can see a drop off in the
highway

00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
highway
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
that would vary from about
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
118 million dollars to about 94 million
 
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.790 align:start position:0%
118 million dollars to about 94 million
dollars

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
but with the road usage fee
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
and they did an analysis on the makeup
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle population to do this
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
this is what their estimates came up on
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
which is about 20 something million
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
dollars higher than it was in 2020
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
and it maintains that
 
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.750 align:start position:0%
and it maintains that
level

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
out to 2030.
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
and if you look at that
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
associated taking into cost of living
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
so it'll still be dropping
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't drop down to 2020 level
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
but what the fee
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
what the study showed
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
is that in the next slide where it says
 
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.509 align:start position:0%
is that in the next slide where it says
annual

00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
annual
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
fuel plus
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
road usage fee cost at various miles per
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
gallon level
 
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
at 20 at 12 000 miles per year
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
and this is with
 
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.470 align:start position:0%
and this is with
gas

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
gas
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
at two dollars and sixty-two cents a
 
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.150 align:start position:0%
at two dollars and sixty-two cents a
gallon

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
gallon
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
where today it's 320.
 
00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:15.350 align:start position:0%
where today it's 320.
that

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
person at 20 miles per gallon
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
would be spending about seventeen
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
to to travel that and gas and road usage
 
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.389 align:start position:0%
to to travel that and gas and road usage
fee

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
fee
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
at thirty miles a gallon
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
something under twelve hundred dollars
 
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
at forty
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
around almost 900 dollars
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
an electric vehicle
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
you would pay the 125 road usage fee
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
plus the cost of electricity
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
and how does the annual fuel
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
plus the
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
road uses feed costs
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
varies at various miles per gallon level
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
showing the 262 a gallon not the 320 a
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
gallon right now
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
and so that you can see how
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
how it varies
 
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:16.470 align:start position:0%
how it varies
tremendously

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
and the poor guy
 
00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:19.189 align:start position:0%
and the poor guy
that

00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
has a 20 miles per gallon
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
is going to be paying
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
if you're talking
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
320 i mean 260 versus
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
a gallon on 600 gallons that's a lot of
 
00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:38.470 align:start position:0%
a gallon on 600 gallons that's a lot of
money

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
last slide shows the average annual fuel
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
tax plus the road usage fee
 
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.189 align:start position:0%
tax plus the road usage fee
on

00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
different categories
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
the roof of the fuel tax of 125 dollars
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
that will drop down because at
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
twenty to thirty you're
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
buying less fuel so you're going to be
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
paying a larger use uses fee but this
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
shows the equity
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
of whether you have a
 
00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.980 align:start position:0%

non-combustible engine

or an electric engine with no gas
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
that they're paying about the same
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
to support the roads and bridges
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
where right now if you have a complete
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle you're paying nothing
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
to support the roads
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
but one other important thing
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
page five of the

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
this is what we've forgotten
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
this is the energy related carbon
 
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
dioxide emission by sectors
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
from 1990 through 2050
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
and you can see that
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
prior to 2020
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
most of the time
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
electric generation power
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
was the
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
culprit which had the largest amount of
 
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.509 align:start position:0%
culprit which had the largest amount of
emissions

00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
and transportation wasn't far behind
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
but now since 2020 transportation is
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
going to be the leader
 
00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:49.590 align:start position:0%
going to be the leader
emitter

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
emitter
 
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.550 align:start position:0%

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.150 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
because we're
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
going off from coal and going to
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
natural gas and doing other things
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
that has dropped
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
now considerably as far as the total pot
 
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.590 align:start position:0%
now considerably as far as the total pot
goes

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
but this is extremely important
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
this is why we need to get the
 
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.390 align:start position:0%
this is why we need to get the
environmentalists

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
environmentalists
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
to support
 
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
this so called road users fee or
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
something similar to it
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
in order if
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
they want to work towards cleaning up
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.710 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
you can stop me anytime but now what i
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
want to do is go to the narrative
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
the narrative is kind of repeats a
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
little bit what i said
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
yeah the road uses fee was designed to
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
counteract the drop in the highway fund
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
the next bullet
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
the objective of the fee is to make up
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
for the state highway trust fund revenue
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's lost because of
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
the efficiency of vehicles
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
the next one is
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
in 2019 we were awarded the 250 000
 
00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.870 align:start position:0%
in 2019 we were awarded the 250 000
grant

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
and and that was
 
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
match with turnpike toll credits to do
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
and then a primary look at the study
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
projected the gas tax revenue raised in
 
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.430 align:start position:0%
projected the gas tax revenue raised in
2020

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.110 align:start position:0%
2020
of

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
128.5 million would decline to 93.4
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
million by 2030.
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
a decline of 35.1 million dollars
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
20 27
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
reduction without the lower juices fee
 
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
the proposed road uses fee according to
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
the study would collect about 28.5
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
million starting in 2021
 
00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:47.590 align:start position:0%
million starting in 2021
with

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
growing to 49.9 million in 2030
 
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
21.4 million increase
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
well the gas tax reduces 35 million
 
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.789 align:start position:0%
well the gas tax reduces 35 million
dollars

00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
using the current trends
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
the combined fuel plus road uses fee for
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
2030 would generate 143 million an
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
increase of
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
149.9 million
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
vehicles not fueled by gasoline would
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
pay a flat fee of 125
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
while all others would pay a graduated
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
fee based on the fuel economy rating
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
the schedule of fees begins with a base
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle with a fuel economy rating of 20
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
miles per gallon and i've explained this
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
shows the first figure
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
savings versus 20 miles per gallon
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
and today's
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
cost gas at 320 a gallon
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
12 000 miles 20 miles per gallon you'd
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
buy 600 gallons of gas pay 1920 dollars
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
with 10 dollar road usage
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
fee and the total cost would be nineteen
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
hundred and thirty dollars
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
if you have a fifty miles per gallon
 
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.270 align:start position:0%
if you have a fifty miles per gallon
vehicle

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
your total cost would be eight hundred
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
and forty three dollars
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
that 50 miles per gallon vehicle
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
would save you over a thousand dollars
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
of operating versus the 20 miles per
 
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.149 align:start position:0%
of operating versus the 20 miles per
gallon

00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
gallon
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
you'd pay 125
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
which is a savings of 1805 versus the
 
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.310 align:start position:0%
which is a savings of 1805 versus the
20.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
20.
 
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.230 align:start position:0%
20.
now

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
i've heard a number of times people
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
telling me
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
that you go to if you have to pay a road
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
usage fee you're penalizing
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
the guy so he's not going to buy the
 
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.470 align:start position:0%
the guy so he's not going to buy the
vehicle

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
but when you look at this graphs that i
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
showed you
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
how much they or just look at this how
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
much they the total cost 125 dollars
 
00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.830 align:start position:0%
much they the total cost 125 dollars
versus

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
1900 for 20 miles per gallon vehicle and
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
even more for less

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
and come to a new committee we can
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
probably find you a seat so
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
with that i can't promise leadership
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh with that uh questions for the
 
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.070 align:start position:0%
uh with that uh questions for the
representative

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank oh i'm sorry yes
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
representative um so you want this to be
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh study how is
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
this different than what the new
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of transportation
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the new hampshire
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
department of transportation i want this
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
to be concentrated on the
 
00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.350 align:start position:0%
to be concentrated on the
environments

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
environments
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
in order to get their support behind
 
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.590 align:start position:0%
in order to get their support behind
this

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question represent
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
plastic are there any other questions
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
for the representative
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
the chairman would like to call steam
 
00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:27.590 align:start position:0%
the chairman would like to call steam

welcome to public works
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i've been here a time or two
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
for the record i'm representative john

graham i represent hillsborough district
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
7 which is the town of bedford
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
for the veteran members of this
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
committee you've heard this before
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
you know that both representative majors
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
and i have sponsored
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
bills that would implement
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
a road usage fee they have always
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
lost on the floor they've passed this
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
committee but they've always lost on the
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
floor of the house from two wings
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
those that say oh god no
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
new taxes or fees can ever be
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
implemented for any reason
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
and on the other sp end of the spectrum
 
00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:24.070 align:start position:0%
and on the other sp end of the spectrum
of

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
we're saving the planet why should we
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
pay more for our electric vehicles
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
what this proposal is
 
00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:35.919 align:start position:0%
is to try to come to some kind of common
 
00:30:35.919 --> 00:30:37.590 align:start position:0%
is to try to come to some kind of common
understanding

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.630 align:start position:0%
understanding
that

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.510 align:start position:0%
that
our

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
state highway fund
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
is losing revenue
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
and as we transition to more
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
both high high
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
mileage vehicles um
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
my car that i own now is a couple years
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
old it's getting 36 miles to the gallon
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
you know 15 years ago if you got 20 or
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
25 you were doing good
 
00:31:06.159 --> 00:31:07.029 align:start position:0%
25 you were doing good
and

00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and other
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
forms of
 
00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.669 align:start position:0%
forms of
energy

00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
are are coming on remember what dot told
 
00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.430 align:start position:0%
are are coming on remember what dot told
us

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
the other day
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
is that within the 10-year plan
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
they have 17 million dollars of federal
 
00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:25.190 align:start position:0%
they have 17 million dollars of federal
funds

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
to establish
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
electrical charging infrastructure
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
within the state
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
we're planning on it coming but if we're
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
not going to charge a vehicle that is as
 
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.430 align:start position:0%
not going to charge a vehicle that is as
large

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
and weighs as much
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
and uses the road as frequently as say a
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
diesel or gasoline-powered vehicle
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
then we are
 
00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.190 align:start position:0%
then we are
are

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.470 align:start position:0%
are
[Music]

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
missing out and we will continue to have
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
problems with our our highway fund
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
and and we will get into it
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
personally i think we should pass
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
not just this bill but we probably ought
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
to uh be having a serious discussion
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
on the future
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
of how we're going to pay for our roads
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
in a bill this is good you'll note that
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
on the bill there is
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
not just house
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
but there are senate sponsors who think
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
that we also begin
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
we really need to look at this i'm
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
surprised that the senate would would
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
come along because they're all going to
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
be ready for reelection and they usually
 
00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.630 align:start position:0%
be ready for reelection and they usually
don't

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
um but i i think that it's useful that
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
we do that
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
and i i just
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday this came as transportation
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
topics i
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
they send it to me every week
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
but but the headline is automated and
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
electric trucks show progress
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
so we're not only looking at cars we're
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
looking at semi-trailers and the rest
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
maybe not next next year but within 10
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
years i can see that happening
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
so i think that we need to do this study
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
realizing that even if i wanted to turn
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
this into an implementation plan
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
that it
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
probably would found her in the house
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
and would definitely not pass the the
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
senate having had some talks over there
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
so i would urge the committee to
 
00:33:25.039 --> 00:33:26.630 align:start position:0%
so i would urge the committee to
pass

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
1040 get it to the center senator so
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
that we can begin
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
to actually look at
 
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:34.870 align:start position:0%
to actually look at
how

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the future we want to fund our
 
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.470 align:start position:0%
in the future we want to fund our
highways

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
highways
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
given the fact that modes of
 
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
transportation are changing
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how many other cards you
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
have if anybody has questions they might
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
want to defer them till i i will answer
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
questions but
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
i'm cognizant of there are other people
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
behind me we only have
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
a little over 25 minutes to finish the
 
00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.389 align:start position:0%
a little over 25 minutes to finish the
hearing

00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you with the
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative graham with
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
your wish of not accepting
 
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.909 align:start position:0%
your wish of not accepting
questions

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
i will but yeah is there anyone
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
represented faulkner did you want to ask
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
yes i can try to do this as
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
constructively as possible uh
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
understanding all the work you've done
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
before but
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
is it within the scope of the study
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
commission to look at the total
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
amount that we're getting whether that's
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
adequate for the future
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
funding of the uh
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
of our highway system and
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
do is within the scope
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
to look at the equity issue of how many
 
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.190 align:start position:0%
to look at the equity issue of how many
people

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
how many miles people drive because this
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
basically sets a flat fee for
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
everybody regardless of whether they
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
drive 50 000 miles or
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
5 000 miles in a year
 
00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.629 align:start position:0%
5 000 miles in a year
um

00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
i i would say that once the commission
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
meets there is always that caveat of
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
other you know these
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
it specifies some things that they
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
should look at but it also has the
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
caveat of or any other issues they want
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
to look at type type of a statement
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's true of any study committee or
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
commission that
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
i will say that we have looked in this
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
committee before about vehicle miles
 
00:35:25.119 --> 00:35:26.150 align:start position:0%
committee before about vehicle miles
traveled

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
traveled
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
we als always run into an issue of am i
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
traveling in
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire vermont maine the
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
commonwealth of massachusetts or on a
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
trip to missouri to see my mother you
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
know how do you measure the miles that
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
you travel
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
if you're going to try to do a miles
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
traveled tax
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
it has not gone well in the couple of
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
states that have tried it
 
00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.870 align:start position:0%
states that have tried it
because

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
even there it's kind of a volunteer with
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
voluntary pilot programs and they still
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
ran into the same types of problems of
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
people not wanting to volunteer because
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
they go across state lines and the rest
 
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:07.910 align:start position:0%
they go across state lines and the rest
so

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.990 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
there would nothing there would be
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
nothing in this to preclude them looking
 
00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.390 align:start position:0%
nothing in this to preclude them looking
at

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
at altern those types of alternatives
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
but i think the focus of this study
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
commission would be on
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
how do we get equity
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
with a
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
say fully electric vehicle
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
registration fees into the highway fund
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
and that's it
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
that's it all
 
00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:38.470 align:start position:0%
that's it all
because

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
you know you and i if we have gas cars
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
at least pay
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
eight uh is it 22. yeah
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
i used to say 18 cents but it's up to 22
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
what for but
 
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.430 align:start position:0%
what for but
um

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
cents per the per gallon and remember
 
00:36:53.599 --> 00:36:54.630 align:start position:0%
cents per the per gallon and remember
that that

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
last two um
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
4.2 cents
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
goes to sunsets in a couple of years and
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
we dropped back to 18 and a half cents
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
so again it it's all impetus to to study
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
how we are going to fund the state
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
portion of our highway
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
in the future okay thank you thank you
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
representative i'm seeing no further
 
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.710 align:start position:0%
representative i'm seeing no further
questions

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
i'd like to note that we only have one
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
pink card remaining
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
i see someone someone someone's coming
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
to need those pink cards and with that i
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
would like to recognize kelly buchanan
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
please come forward welcome to public
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%

you it's nice to see you as well
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative mcconkey thank you
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
members of the committee this morning
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my testimony
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
my name is kelly buchanan and i'm
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
director of legislative and regulatory
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
affairs at clean energy new hampshire
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
and as part of our work at clean energy
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we do a lot on electric
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles we have founded and managed the
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
initiative called drive electric new
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire that's a coalition of
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholders interested in evs that come
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
together to promote the accelerated
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
adoption of evs and the installation of
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
things evs need like charging
 
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.710 align:start position:0%
things evs need like charging
infrastructure

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
we do most of this work through
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
education and outreach
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
but the transition to electric vehicles
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
is ever impending we've seen a lot of
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
movement from manufacturers as well as
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
policy initiatives at the state level at
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission to
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
establish electric rates that
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
serve electric vehicle charging as well
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
and so i come before you this morning in
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
support of house bill 1040. this really
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
is the most appropriate approach to
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
determining a revenue alternative rather
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
than an immediate implementation road
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
toll for electric vehicles
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire we still have a
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
very low adoption rate of evs i believe
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
for my work at the public utilities
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
commission the numbers range from
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know a couple thousand electric
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles registered in the state so far
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
but i know this is changing for example
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
our board of directors a majority of
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
them drive evs or hybrids and a few of
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
our staff do as well
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
so this study gives us an opportunity to
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
address the issue before it becomes an
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
issue and ensures that we have a
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
collaborative buy-in from the
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in this process
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
a thorough and well-informed study will
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
aid in consensus to address any
 
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
potential shortfalls in the funding of
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
our highways and bridges because it does
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
seem quite rational to ensure that
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles are
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
contributing to roads as well
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
so with that i would be glad to take any
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
of your questions this morning
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you or thank you are there
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
my last card that i have is from rebecca
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
holler if i remember correctly
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you representative
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
mcconkey uh rebecca ohler department of
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
environmental services i'm the bureau
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
we were a member of the previous
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
commission that studied this issue and
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
are happy to see that another commission
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
is going to be called on this
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
because we do have changing
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
changing facts and figures we are now up
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
to in the neighbor well we haven't done
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
an analysis of the ev
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
rates since um
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
early 2020
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
or 2020 registrations but we're you know
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're closer in the six to seven
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
thousand range of plug-in hybrids and
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
hybrid and electric vehicles
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
in the state so far
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
so we are growing it's still a very
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
small number um
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
and we look forward to
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
looking at all of the alternatives for
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
how we might make an equitable
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
an equitable program that will allow
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
everybody to pay their fair share i know
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
that there are other proposals in
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
different bills
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
some that include
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
annual miles traveled some that are
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
one that will be heard next
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
based on the
 
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.030 align:start position:0%
based on the
the

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
easy pass system
 
00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.910 align:start position:0%
easy pass system
but

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
i mean there are definitely a lot of
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
considerations to to
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
examine and we look forward to bringing
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
data to the table and working with the
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
commission to come up with a solution
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for your testimonies are
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for solar
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative faulkner thank you
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you have this
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
information but uh
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
you indicated 4 000 electrical vehicles
 
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.790 align:start position:0%
you indicated 4 000 electrical vehicles
electric

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
electric
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles that seems
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
like a low share of the the nation's
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
total are we behind the behind the curve
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
on this or yes
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is the only state in the
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
northeast that has not adopted an
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle mandate
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
all of the other i think there's
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
14 northeast states
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
that have adopted the california
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
vehicle standards which require
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
that auto manufacturers offer for sale a
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
minimum percentage
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
of their total vehicles as evs
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
and that does not exist in new hampshire
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
so actually new hampshire dealerships
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
get fewer evs placed on their lots to
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
sell because the manufacturers don't get
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
the credits that they need in the other
 
00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.230 align:start position:0%
the credits that they need in the other
states

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
i bought an ev i actually had to buy my
 
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
eev out of new jersey
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
so i couldn't get it out of new
 
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.270 align:start position:0%
so i couldn't get it out of new
hampshire

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.470 align:start position:0%
hampshire
um

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
we have fewer and i and i think that
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
we're more in the you know six to seven
 
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
thousand range right now but again we
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
will hopefully have some updated data
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
in time for this study commission
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.470 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
questions

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%

hi good morning
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
for the record marie mullen director of
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
finance for new hampshire d.o.t and here
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
to just support
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.309 align:start position:0%
the bill
we

00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
you know have long advocated that the
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
fuel efficiency for all vehicles
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
has been eroding over time and will
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
continue to and as major
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative major has indicated i
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be accelerating very
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
quickly now with the adoption of
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and all the
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
private businesses putting into this
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
this industry so we would support this
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
bill in looking at
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know alternative ways of looking at
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
this and
 
00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.470 align:start position:0%
this and
i'll

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%

here is my intent with this bill seeing
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
as how
 
01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.230 align:start position:0%
as how
um

01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
i will hear testimony both for and
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
against the bill from members of the
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
public departments or whoever is here
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
and then i will recess and reopen the
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
public hearing next week
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
um it will be in the house calendar for
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%

but as a courtesy to to the prime
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor i'm going to do that
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
but we will proceed today

um in support or opposition to
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
as written
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate the
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
pink card

the blue sheet is over there if you just
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
want to register your
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
approval or disapproval of the bill
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
first person
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
i'd like to speak is
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
jason stock
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
and representing the new hampshire
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
for the record i'm jason stock i'm the
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
executive director of the new hampshire
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
timberland owners association and our
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
association represents certainly land
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
owners but we also represent people that
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
work in the forest and truck drive
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
trucks that carry forest products from
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
the woods to the sawmills and
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
in other destinations around the state
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
and i've
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
come today i'll be very brief to to just
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
express our our opposition to this bill
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
not only is there a cost factor but we
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
feel that
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
kind of allocating funds to you know you
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
have a a capital budget process
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
and what we don't
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
what we
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
fear is that we start creating
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
situations where i have a project or a
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
type of project and i want to have it
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
appropriated you know appropriate a
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
chunk of money for that
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
we feel that that would hamstring the
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
work of this committee down the road
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
when you look at the state's capital
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
needs on a holistic basis
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
and say all right what is really the
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
needs of the state when it comes to
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure if it's noise abatement
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
if it's a bridge if it's
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
whatever we would hate to see that
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
effort hamstrung and so for the two
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
reasons one is the
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
increased cost
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
when i tried to calculate the cost using
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
the proposed formula the cost increase
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure i got the math right
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
i was never a really good math student
 
01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
but it was significant
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
on a per truck basis so if you have a
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
fleet of trucks it would be significant
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
but secondarily there's kind of a
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
process issue and a process concern and
 
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll conclude my testimony
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
and be happy to try to answer any
 
01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.349 align:start position:0%
and be happy to try to answer any
questions

01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%

01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chairman for the
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
record my name is gary abbott i'm the
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
executive vice president of the
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of new
 
01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.870 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of new
hampshire

01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
i come today to you in opposition of the
 
01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.390 align:start position:0%
i come today to you in opposition of the
bill

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
and i'm probably one who likes to
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
increase funding for the highways and
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
i like to support those bills that help
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
us build our roads but i think this bill
 
01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.069 align:start position:0%
us build our roads but i think this bill
has

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of either premises or theories
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
used that are not quite correct
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
first of all the d.o.t
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
and our highways are built to a certain
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
standard to adequately
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
adequately hold the weight of trucks as
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
well as cars
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
they're built to a certain standard
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
to meet those legal limit weights
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
the other thing that's not really
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
included in here and i can go all the
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
way back to
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
i think it was the early 90s
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
when we demonstrated trucks
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
and their impact
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
braking distances back when we did
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
certified weights i know most of you
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
were not around back then
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
but we talked about the size of tires on
 
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%
trucks compared to automobiles
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
their actual pressure impact is
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
different and it eases the weight across
 
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
the highway
 
01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.750 align:start position:0%
the highway
so

01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
we used as an example
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
a person with a small footprint with a
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
lot of weight actually has more impact
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
than a truck with all of those wheels
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
and all of that spread out weight
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
distribution that's why we have
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
certified weights and i'm kind of going
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
into something that's not really in the
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
bill but you have to understand
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
this bill kind of attacks by weight of a
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle on a road
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
it takes registration and redistributes
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
how those funds are collected
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
it lowers
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
the rates for automobiles
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
and it raises those for trucks
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
and i had a person in our office that
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
has a fleet of trucks and said this is
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
going to cost me about 300 percent more
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
for each truck
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
what i want to raise to you is that you
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
know how important trucking is today
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
after covid of two years and how we get
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
all our products and we're talking about
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
need for truck drivers and everything
 
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.550 align:start position:0%
need for truck drivers and everything
else

01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
so to put this financial burden doesn't
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
really put it completely on whatever
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
company it puts it back on you for the
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
cost of goods
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
so keep in mind that this uh shifting
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
then the bill has things that
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
we've talked about through noah majors
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
bill and others
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
how to keep track of how many miles
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
someone travels
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
nobody's figured that out yet it's in
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
we don't know how you would do that the
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
formula is so complicated
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
jason at least took a shot at it i
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
didn't take a shot at it because i could
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
not figure out
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
if my truck was in this category and
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
then there's a multiplying factor based
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
on miles
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
it just is very very complicated
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to really address some
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
of the other i actually don't like road
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
usage fee as a title on this bill
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
because it's more of the old days
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
if dick flynn the department of safety
 
01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.709 align:start position:0%
if dick flynn the department of safety
said

01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
we need a registration fee increase he
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
would come in with a form and say okay
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
five percent more we've looked at all
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
the surrounding states and we should
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
charge more and he'd come in with a
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
chart and yep truckers would go up five
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
percent more cars would go up five
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
percent more
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's how registrations fees work in
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
order to have enough funding for both
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
the department of safety and go into the
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
when you look at the fiscal note has no
 
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
clue as to how much this brings in or
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't bring in
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's undetermined
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
it definitely has costs of trying to
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
figure out how to put in this
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
complicated formula
 
01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.070 align:start position:0%
complicated formula
so

01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
it was very hard for us because we don't
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
we don't know really what this does
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
except make everything much more
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
complicated it's not similar to the
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
other road usage
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
bills that you just heard
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
regarding trying to make sure vehicles
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
at least all pay the same way
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
the other thing that
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
you should understand trucks already pay
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
a lot more
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
trucks get six to 10 miles to the gallon
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
compared to motor vehicles i get 20 plus
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
there are already two times when you
 
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
start to do the gas tax and the others
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
and then you look at commercial vehicles
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
do travel a lot more than the average
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
citizen because they're out there every
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
day making money for the companies that
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
operate them
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
so trucks already pay a lot of money
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
when it comes to using our highways and
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
they pay
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
probably some trucking companies would
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
say they pay more than their fair share
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
if they were here today but i just want
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
to highlight all of that because as we
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make a lot of sense to
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
do this complicated formula unless
 
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
carbon tax or some other i haven't
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
figured out
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
why we would be doing this
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
because we don't really know the money
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
we're not saying we need the money at
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
the moment so with that i would hope
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
this committee would really look at this
 
01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.030 align:start position:0%
this committee would really look at this
bill

01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
just try to figure it out if you did own
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
an 80 000 truck how much you would pay
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
and i would hope the committee would uh
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
itl this legislation uh and i would end
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
my testimony and answer any questions
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr abbott questions from
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
saying none i do have one
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if you have an answer
 
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
but given the fact that
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
you said you're already paying a lot
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
more in registration and others
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
are any of your members registering
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
their trucks
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
in a neighboring state
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
because it's cheaper to register them in
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
a different state but can still work
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
i guess what i can tell you is
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
i'm aware that registering trailers is
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
much less expensive in other states and
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
would love to have the department and
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
safety others address that issue
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
and it's very easy in new england we're
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
a small state for companies to have
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
branch offices in other states to do
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
that it's not really usually the truck
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's usually the trailer
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
and there is a big disparity that we
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
charge a lot more in new hampshire than
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of that particular issue but
 
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
if you legally
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
have a branch in another state you could
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
have those trucks or trailers registered
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
in those states
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
i have no further paint cards
 
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
is there anybody who
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
has not testified on house bill

is there anybody who has spoken once who
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak again
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
see none
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%

executive session because we were
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
waiting on

yeah this is just more of a question um
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
just that came to me over the last week
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
um the other day we heard uh or we heard
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
name of a bridge stays with the bridge
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
and that this bridge is moving to keene
 
01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:41.910 align:start position:0%
and that this bridge is moving to keene
as

01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to know is it moving
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
as a footbridge or is it as a regular
 
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
bridge because i just want to make sure
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
that we're not like going to have two
 
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
bridges in different parts of the state
 
01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:54.229 align:start position:0%
bridges in different parts of the state
name

01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
and then possibly mess up like google
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
maps and all those other
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
take take a shot at it barry
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you the this bridge is going on in
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
a bike path it's a part of a
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
rail trail it's owned by the state
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
and it crosses over route 101
 
01:17:15.679 --> 01:17:16.870 align:start position:0%
and it crosses over route 101
that

01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
the old railroad bridge was taken down a
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
number of years ago so this would
 
01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
replace that and would allow the rail
 
01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
trail to be continued so it's not on the
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's satisfied

you probably don't often hear this but
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
i've been struggling on a direction on
 
02:01:02.470 --> 02:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
how to present this to you all
 
02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm going freelance off the cuff
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
i'll start by saying
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you're familiar with
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
exit 11 on route 93.
 
02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's the toll booth um and it's
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
undeveloped been like that for a long
 
02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
time with the exception of a of a brief
 
02:01:20.709 --> 02:01:20.719 align:start position:0%
period there was an auctioneer there
 
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
that created a pad site
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
there is currently no infrastructure
 
02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
there which the town is actually working
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
on we've adopted a tiff for water sewer
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
but all the roads in the area
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
hackett hill road is the main one
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
connects route 3a to the total
 
02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:38.149 align:start position:0%
connects route 3a to the total
interchange

02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
interchange
 
02:01:38.159 --> 02:01:39.189 align:start position:0%
interchange
and

02:01:39.189 --> 02:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:41.109 --> 02:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
it goes beyond the interchange up to the
 
02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
state shed with with offices and that's
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
all under the jurisdiction of the d.o.t
 
02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.270 align:start position:0%
all under the jurisdiction of the d.o.t
um

02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
i looked at the direction again i just
 
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to shine some light on the issue
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
at exit 11 because it is prime for
 
02:01:56.149 --> 02:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
development except for its its issues
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
and i didn't know how else to do it
 
02:01:58.159 --> 02:02:00.629 align:start position:0%
and i didn't know how else to do it
um

02:02:00.629 --> 02:02:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:02.830 --> 02:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
i started with looking at the at the
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
tolls uh because of a sentiment that's
 
02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
in town has been in town long before i
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
was a representative
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
but we've been
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
looking at our unique turnpike system
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
which is unlike most that's limited
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
access there's still plenty of ways to
 
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
get around tolls
 
02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
and so the people in the
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
vicinities in my opinion and a lot of
 
02:02:26.709 --> 02:02:26.719 align:start position:0%
people's opinions disproportionately pay
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
the tolls just for timing's sake for
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
their commutes
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's been almost 50 years i believe
 
02:02:34.149 --> 02:02:34.159 align:start position:0%
since that toll's been there and
 
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
basically the only thing that we have to
 
02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
show for it in the town is
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
the most dangerous intersection in the
 
02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
town of hooksett
 
02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
i'm also the chair of the hooksett
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
planning board we do see the hooks of
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
crash data every year
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
town wide and it's continually at the
 
02:02:50.790 --> 02:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
top of the list for incidents
 
02:02:52.390 --> 02:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
in all fairness i've been explaining to
 
02:02:54.070 --> 02:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
my constituents over the years that
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
there's a 10-year plan
 
02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
this has been on it for many years
 
02:02:58.639 --> 02:03:00.470 align:start position:0%
this has been on it for many years
unfortunately

02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
it our fair share or our portion of the
 
02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
contribution to the improvements at
 
02:03:08.070 --> 02:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
hackett hill and 3a have failed on the
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
warrant because in my opinion some of
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
the sentiment people wondering
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
you know all these years we've been
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
paying tolls and what do we have to show
 
02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
for it just
 
02:03:18.790 --> 02:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
they don't think they should have to
 
02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
raise taxes
 
02:03:23.669 --> 02:03:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh on top of the tolls they're paying
 
02:03:25.589 --> 02:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
anyway i've been still doing my due
 
02:03:27.189 --> 02:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
diligence to
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know remind them how it works i it's
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
still on the 10-year plan i appreciate
 
02:03:31.119 --> 02:03:32.310 align:start position:0%
still on the 10-year plan i appreciate
that

02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:33.189 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
the reason
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
the other reason i went this way is when
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
i received a
 
02:03:39.510 --> 02:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
email from a 15 year old who's currently
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
going through driver's ed who is scared
 
02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
for her life at the same intersection so
 
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
i felt i needed to do something
 
02:03:47.350 --> 02:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
something some way to shine some light
 
02:03:48.790 --> 02:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
so that was the angle i took
 
02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
for conceiving the bill
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
but now let me move into the the issues
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
with exit 11 and it's my opinion that
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
this would be prime it is prime for
 
02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:06.229 align:start position:0%
this would be prime it is prime for
development

02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
development
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh we have a developer that's looking at
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
it now to introduce a 500 000 square
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
foot distribution facility he's got the
 
02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
room for another 250 000 and that
 
02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't even include the east side of
 
02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:19.030 align:start position:0%
doesn't even include the east side of
the

02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
um of the highway
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
so they have done their own traffic
 
02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
report this is it
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh the department of transportation i
 
02:04:31.830 --> 02:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
believe did a peer review on it and
 
02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:33.350 align:start position:0%
believe did a peer review on it and
agreed

02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:34.719 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
road structure right there the road
 
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
system around that which is again all
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
controlled by dot
 
02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%
if you look at a glass of water in terms
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
of the traffic
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's not just full it's overflowing so
 
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
until we get a solution or some help
 
02:04:52.149 --> 02:04:52.159 align:start position:0%
with making some needed upgrades to that
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
road system that's going to be an
 
02:04:56.470 --> 02:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
undeveloped piece of property for a long
 
02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
long time
 
02:05:01.750 --> 02:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
the developers
 
02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
and explain that situation there's no
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
way that we can actually approve any
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
more development over there until
 
02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
something happens
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
their claim to me was that the dot was
 
02:05:15.589 --> 02:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
actually not very cooperative with them
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
so they suggested if we give them a
 
02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
conditional approval
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll get some more
 
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
some more feedback
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
we did
 
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
but i haven't heard anything in months
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
now from the developer to see that's
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
anything anything's changed so again i'm
 
02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
not making any accusations i really just
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
for the committee wanted to explain
 
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
what's going on in hooksett and why that
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
that area is not developed
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
the people in town don't think it's
 
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
all their responsibility
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
and the developers of course are saying
 
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's not there nor do they have the
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
money to
 
02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
to upgrade all the roads to handle any
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
development there it would be nice to
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
see not just for the people of town but
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
it would be a regional economic benefit
 
02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
so again
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
i'll be honest with you my expectations
 
02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
are realistic when i put this bill in
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
but i didn't know how else to shine some
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
light on the whole situation again i do
 
02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that hackett hill 3a
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
is still on the 10-year plan
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
it's in for 26. it's not going to do any
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
development any good on the immediate
 
02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
in the immediate future but nonetheless
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
it's there
 
02:06:25.599 --> 02:06:26.390 align:start position:0%
it's there
and

02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
again i'm just trying to make this a
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
conversation that's all i have thank you
 
02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
02:06:35.109 --> 02:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
um thank you for testifying uh questions
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee
 
02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative jack
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you the other chairman
 
02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
i missed where the high accident
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
location is and i want to make sure i
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
all right one off
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
hackett hill road and 3a
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
and if you'd like i can reach out to the
 
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
hooksett pd and get you
 
02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
several years back if you like
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
no thank you that's fine i just want to
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
make sure it's in a minute okay
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
so the toll you're asking for is if you
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
go up hack at hill road and take a right
 
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
that toll you want removed
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
and what's that going to do
 
02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:18.709 align:start position:0%
and what's that going to do
[Music]

02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:07:18.719 --> 02:07:19.510 align:start position:0%
[Music]
to

02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
reduce that amount of traffic
 
02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:23.679 align:start position:0%
i mean it it would seem like the toll
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm not in favor of the toll but
 
02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
if uh it would seem like that
 
02:07:32.790 --> 02:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
hole slows down some of that
 
02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:33.750 align:start position:0%
hole slows down some of that
issue

02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
because they've got to pull through the
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
toll pull out to hackett hill take a
 
02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:38.550 align:start position:0%
toll pull out to hackett hill take a
left

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
left
 
02:07:41.669 --> 02:07:41.679 align:start position:0%
go down and and i've experienced that
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just curious uh
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
why that
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
is preventing development is hack is
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
that hackett hill
 
02:07:57.589 --> 02:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
access the only you're talking about the
 
02:07:57.599 --> 02:07:58.790 align:start position:0%
access the only you're talking about the
plaza

02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
plaza
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:04.229 --> 02:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
if i can there's actually two sides
 
02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the highway is open for
 
02:08:08.149 --> 02:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
development the palazzi property is
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
available right now also
 
02:08:13.589 --> 02:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
and the west side of the um
 
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
of the highway which it's a big bowl
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
actually the pad sites already been
 
02:08:18.159 --> 02:08:19.270 align:start position:0%
actually the pad sites already been
installed

02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
installed
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
were created
 
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
but everybody's at a standstill until we
 
02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
can get some answers on what the design
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
needs to look like on hacker hill road
 
02:08:29.430 --> 02:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
to relieve all that pressure the reason
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
i brought up the tall angle was just out
 
02:08:33.669 --> 02:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
of i'll be honest with you frustration
 
02:08:35.510 --> 02:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
because i couldn't see anything going
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
and the sentiment of a lot of people in
 
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
town that say why are we after just in
 
02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
my opinion because of the way you can
 
02:08:45.270 --> 02:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
sneak around that toll all you want you
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
can go a couple of miles to exit 10 you
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
can go a couple of miles to exit 12. use
 
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
the same system and not pay
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
the people in town have been looking and
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
saying we do pay for this why do we have
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
to raise our taxes on the warren article
 
02:08:58.149 --> 02:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
to get any improvements over there
 
02:09:00.550 --> 02:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
that's why i took this angle i'm not
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily still looking at it i would
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
be more than happy to leave the tolls
 
02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
there if we could get some legitimate
 
02:09:06.159 --> 02:09:07.430 align:start position:0%
there if we could get some legitimate
cooperation

02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
cooperation
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
and come to some solutions in a timely
 
02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:10.390 align:start position:0%
and come to some solutions in a timely
fashion

02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
to get this resolved and and and allowed
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:22.950 align:start position:0%
 
up

02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
i thought i did
 
02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
um hackett hill on the other end
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
on the southern end
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
does that access that well it's a large
 
02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
loop it goes from the hookset
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
side by the tollbooth and it loops over
 
02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
the hill back into the manchester side
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
back to 3a yeah it's a big loop
 
02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
so that couldn't be used as an access
 
02:09:43.119 --> 02:09:47.669 align:start position:0%
so that couldn't be used as an access
follow-up

02:09:47.669 --> 02:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:50.550 --> 02:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:52.950 align:start position:0%
any further questions
um

02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully you as the
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
both the representative and and on the
 
02:09:59.270 --> 02:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
planning commission
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
have tried to explain to the residents
 
02:10:03.189 --> 02:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
of hooksett that the toll pace for the
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
turnpike and not for the rest of the
 
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
highways within the town
 
02:10:10.390 --> 02:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
and that the turnpike runs up the
 
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
interstate and one and what you're
 
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
paying for is to use that section and
 
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
not 3a or or any of the rest of it
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
i have but i believe the turnpike would
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
still be responsible for the interchange
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
at hackett hill from the booth i'm not
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's what i believe i may not
 
02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
be correct
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions see none thank you
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call
 
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
john cochran from new hampshire d.o.t
 
02:11:01.750 --> 02:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you chairman graham
 
02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the committee
 
02:11:08.790 --> 02:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
the d.o.t is in opposition the bill
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
so first get started the turnpike
 
02:11:13.270 --> 02:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
enterprise fund is a self-maintaining
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
fund through the collection of totals
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
this fund
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
pays for all the turnpike
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
operation and maintenance bond payments
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
campus program and r r
 
02:11:26.550 --> 02:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
and there is no money supported through
 
02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
the highway fund
 
02:11:30.870 --> 02:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
over the past several years legislative
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
bills and government council approvals
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
have removed exit 11 and 12 toll plazas
 
02:11:38.709 --> 02:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
which equated to approximately one point
 
02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
four million pre-covered
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
post-covet is around seven hundred
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in revenue
 
02:11:48.069 --> 02:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
um with these removable toll plans the
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
department expresses concerns because
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
the erosion of the turnpike revenue
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
which is funded the entire turnpike
 
02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:57.189 align:start position:0%
which is funded the entire turnpike
system

02:11:57.189 --> 02:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
that we have the removal of these toll
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
plazas and we without any offsetting or
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
mitigating revenue enhancements
 
02:12:07.109 --> 02:12:07.119 align:start position:0%
and we still have to maintain the whole
 
02:12:08.950 --> 02:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
turnpike system
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
most recently exit 10
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
was removed in
 
02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:15.510 align:start position:0%
was removed in
1231.

02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
1231.
 
02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:17.030 align:start position:0%
1231.
that

02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
loss of revenue is approximately
 
02:12:22.229 --> 02:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
300k um there has been signage erected
 
02:12:24.629 --> 02:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
there for the zero toll and we're
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
diverting people through lane one
 
02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
and then this summer we'll be removing
 
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
that plaza for approximately another 800
 
02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:32.470 align:start position:0%
that plaza for approximately another 800
000k

02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
000k
 
02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
even 1 dollars sorry
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
um similar to exit 12 and 11 toll plaza
 
02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh exit tens will not the removal this
 
02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
summer will not include the building the
 
02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:43.750 align:start position:0%
summer will not include the building the
tunnel

02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
tunnel
 
02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:44.870 align:start position:0%
tunnel
um

02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
reducing the ramp with to a single rank
 
02:12:47.599 --> 02:12:48.950 align:start position:0%
reducing the ramp with to a single rank
rampling

02:12:48.950 --> 02:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
rampling
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
that will be taken care of in the
 
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
nashville merrimack bedford project
 
02:12:55.109 --> 02:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
that's coming up through and widening
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
the fv everett
 
02:12:58.709 --> 02:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
this additional work will probably add
 
02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
four million dollars to those projects
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
for the removal of the tunnel
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
as you all know covet has impacted our
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
revenue tremendously
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
based on our recent traffic and revenue
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
study in 2021
 
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
compared to the previous study in 2019
 
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
for our bond
 
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:21.430 align:start position:0%
for our bond
refinancing

02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
refinancing
 
02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year 20 to 30 we're losing
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:31.270 align:start position:0%
 
turnpikes

02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
turnpikes
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
truthfully does not need another toll
 
02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
plaza remove the loss in revenue and
 
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
hooksett ramp will range from 1.7 to 1.8
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars that revenue we will
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
lose there's also a possibility of
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
diversion from hooksett mainline because
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
there'll be a free
 
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
free access
 
02:13:51.910 --> 02:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
we our traffic revenue consultant has
 
02:13:53.589 --> 02:13:53.599 align:start position:0%
done a study on that
 
02:13:55.430 --> 02:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
and they estimate the diversion will
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
cost us another 1.3 to 1.4 million a
 
02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:01.109 align:start position:0%
cost us another 1.3 to 1.4 million a
year

02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
this again in a 10-year period
 
02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
represents another loss of 31 million
 
02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
dollars for the turnpike system
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
in addition to the diversion of
 
02:14:14.550 --> 02:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
the hooksett main line toll
 
02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
we foresee that route 3a and hacking
 
02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
hill road
 
02:14:20.550 --> 02:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
congestion will be even worse than it is
 
02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:21.990 align:start position:0%
congestion will be even worse than it is
now

02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
as described before me that intersection
 
02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
is very congested at peak periods
 
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
and by removing the hooksett ramp toll
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
it'll probably increase that
 
02:14:34.229 --> 02:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
intersection to worse
 
02:14:37.109 --> 02:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
um delays and
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
impacts to it
 
02:14:41.589 --> 02:14:41.599 align:start position:0%
um the the loss in revenue impacts our
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
total operations which is mentioned
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
which includes our personnel and
 
02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:47.510 align:start position:0%
which includes our personnel and
staffing

02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
and benefits costs our contract vendors
 
02:14:52.709 --> 02:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
our materials
 
02:14:54.550 --> 02:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
at this time of year salt that's all
 
02:14:57.669 --> 02:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
part of that the equipment for our plow
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
trucks and
 
02:14:59.199 --> 02:15:00.629 align:start position:0%
trucks and
vehicles

02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
02:15:02.069 --> 02:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
and also
 
02:15:04.550 --> 02:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
impacts the renewal replacement program
 
02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
which is where we take care of all
 
02:15:08.310 --> 02:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
resurfacing our bridge rehabs bridge
 
02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:09.669 align:start position:0%
resurfacing our bridge rehabs bridge
painting

02:15:09.669 --> 02:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
painting
 
02:15:12.550 --> 02:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
and bond payments in the capital capital
 
02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:14.470 align:start position:0%
and bond payments in the capital capital
program

02:15:14.470 --> 02:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
as all of you know the decrease in
 
02:15:19.109 --> 02:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
revenue has impact our capital program
 
02:15:22.149 --> 02:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
as mentioned through a 10-year plan
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
hearings four of our major projects have
 
02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:25.189 align:start position:0%
hearings four of our major projects have
been

02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
the department has worked hard over the
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
last decade to institute a sound finish
 
02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal management even with the revenue
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
impacts due to covet
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
the removal of merrimack plazas we
 
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
continue to strive
 
02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
and reduce our operation expense execute
 
02:15:43.679 --> 02:15:44.550 align:start position:0%
and reduce our operation expense execute
our

02:15:44.550 --> 02:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:15:46.390 --> 02:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
r r program to keep the infrastructure
 
02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
in good working order
 
02:15:50.950 --> 02:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
and carry on with a capital program to
 
02:15:52.629 --> 02:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
help reduce congestion
 
02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
and safety
 
02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
in 2019 when we went for refinancing of
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
our bonds
 
02:15:59.119 --> 02:15:59.910 align:start position:0%
our bonds
our

02:15:59.910 --> 02:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:16:03.350 --> 02:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
our rating was very it was excellent
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
the department again is going to
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
refinancing of our bonds we're working
 
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
on that where the goal is for may
 
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
and during our recent financial advisory
 
02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
meeting they spoke to us about the
 
02:16:17.350 --> 02:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
removal of exit 10 we were able to
 
02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
address that but then they also heard
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
about xl possibility xl
 
02:16:24.069 --> 02:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
xl11 hooksett ramp being removed that
 
02:16:26.149 --> 02:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
raised serious concerns with them
 
02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
and questions about the removal of that
 
02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
due to the revenue
 
02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
loss with that what that can help hurt
 
02:16:36.150 --> 02:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
us is in our bond ratings and then also
 
02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
when we're going to purchase bonds it
 
02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
could be at a higher payment
 
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
and that concludes
 
02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
my presentation
 
02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
um before i open it up to questions from
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i do have one
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
um the previous speaker talked about
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
his understanding of how far out the
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
turnpike was responsible for
 
02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
can you try to clarify that from members
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
of the committee does it end at the end
 
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
of the off ramp or does it extend
 
02:17:12.629 --> 02:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
further out
 
02:17:14.790 --> 02:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
we maintain all the way down the heck
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
hill road till 3a roots for new
 
02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire through 3a we do not maintain
 
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
or responsible for new hampshire through
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
a 3a and then we go up packet hill road
 
02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
to just beyond the bridge that goes over
 
02:17:27.679 --> 02:17:28.950 align:start position:0%
to just beyond the bridge that goes over
the

02:17:28.950 --> 02:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
interstate bridge it goes over 93.
 
02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's the responsibility of the
 
02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:40.830 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:17:40.830 --> 02:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:17:43.990 --> 02:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
query thank you um
 
02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
so two questions one would be somewhat
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
of a follow-up on uh chairman graham's
 
02:17:48.719 --> 02:17:49.990 align:start position:0%
of a follow-up on uh chairman graham's
question

02:17:49.990 --> 02:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
does that include um for maintenance of
 
02:17:55.349 --> 02:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
that hackett hill road area does that
 
02:17:55.359 --> 02:17:57.990 align:start position:0%
that hackett hill road area does that
include

02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
creating

02:17:59.030 --> 02:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
creating
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
traffic patterns and all that kind of
 
02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
issues whether that be stop signs yield
 
02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:04.230 align:start position:0%
issues whether that be stop signs yield
signs

02:18:04.230 --> 02:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
signs
 
02:18:08.469 --> 02:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire 3a is maintained by um
 
02:18:13.990 --> 02:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
district five of the highway fund we
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
would work with them but they're mainly
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
in control that intersection i guess i
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
meant uh further up on
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
within the the hackett hill area yes
 
02:18:25.830 --> 02:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
from 3a up to where i mentioned where
 
02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:27.599 align:start position:0%
our responsibility ends near the bridge
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
which is near our office
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
and then a second
 
02:18:35.669 --> 02:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
so my other question would be is
 
02:18:41.349 --> 02:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
regulations about how far a tollbooth
 
02:18:47.669 --> 02:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
plaza has to be away from any kind of
 
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh like stoplight because i'm just
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
looking at the map here of that specific
 
02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:54.150 align:start position:0%
looking at the map here of that specific
area

02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:18:56.709 --> 02:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
and it seems like there'd only be about
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
25 yards or so
 
02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
from the toll plaza to where a stop
 
02:19:03.589 --> 02:19:03.599 align:start position:0%
light could be placed is there any
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
regulations about that so that it
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
during the like the intersection re
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
design they will look at that but
 
02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
there's no like regulations for that
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
further questions representative boyd
 
02:19:25.830 --> 02:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman mr corker and
 
02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
um alluding to my colleagues testimony
 
02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:32.389 align:start position:0%
um alluding to my colleagues testimony
regarding

02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
the town of hooks that has d.o.t ever
 
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
had any ex parte conversation
 
02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
with either the landowners that have
 
02:19:40.389 --> 02:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
bought the exit eleven interchange of
 
02:19:42.309 --> 02:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
the town of hooksett regarding those
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
development opportunities that my
 
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
yes that's part of um we call it a
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh driveway review
 
02:19:55.590 --> 02:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
um the d.o.t isn't part of that and
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
right now it's in the
 
02:19:59.590 --> 02:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
the part of the review is in the traffic
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
study part of it and that goes through
 
02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
our bureau of
 
02:20:07.030 --> 02:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
traffic and we work with them
 
02:20:07.990 --> 02:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:20:12.309 --> 02:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:13.359 --> 02:20:15.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
so west river road
 
02:20:19.510 --> 02:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
also known as 3a
 
02:20:21.349 --> 02:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
is managed by
 
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
not the d.o.t but
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's d.o.t but a different division yes
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
it's these d.o.t highways versus d.o.t
 
02:20:28.399 --> 02:20:29.510 align:start position:0%
it's these d.o.t highways versus d.o.t
turnpikes

02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
turnpikes
 
02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:30.389 align:start position:0%
turnpikes
okay

02:20:30.389 --> 02:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
has there ever been any contemplation
 
02:20:34.550 --> 02:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
because i i share my colleagues concern
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
because it is
 
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
for the lack of a better word it is
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
treacherous trying to negotiate a
 
02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
left-hand turn coming out of that exit
 
02:20:43.750 --> 02:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
um to head northbound on 3a has there
 
02:20:45.910 --> 02:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
ever been any conversations
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
with the town both in both departments
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
regarding widening that interchange
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
traffic calming anything to that extent
 
02:20:54.790 --> 02:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
that would mitigate
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that my colleague
 
02:20:58.950 --> 02:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
alluded to
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
all right for the record uh i'm william
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
cassie assistant commissioner i figured
 
02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
i'd help john with this answer because i
 
02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
i've been involved with this for a
 
02:21:09.910 --> 02:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
little bit longer um representative
 
02:21:11.910 --> 02:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
walsh i think alluded to it there had
 
02:21:13.349 --> 02:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
been a
 
02:21:18.550 --> 02:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
it originated from some prior
 
02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
development uh
 
02:21:24.389 --> 02:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
initiatives that had happened that never
 
02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
took place there but associated with
 
02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
those prior developments that didn't go
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
forward we had committed to improvements
 
02:21:33.270 --> 02:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
at that intersection in conjunction with
 
02:21:34.389 --> 02:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
the town
 
02:21:35.830 --> 02:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
through what used to be known as the
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
state aid highway program and that was
 
02:21:40.230 --> 02:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
state funds that were matched by
 
02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:41.670 align:start position:0%
state funds that were matched by
one-third

02:21:41.670 --> 02:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
one-third
 
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
town funds
 
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
um to address that that intersection so
 
02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
we we had worked through that and i i
 
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
forget the exact details but it must
 
02:21:51.510 --> 02:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
have been a couple of couple of years
 
02:21:52.950 --> 02:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
ago that
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
we had worked it up to taking it to bid
 
02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
the bids came in um
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
higher higher than our estimates and and
 
02:22:02.469 --> 02:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
i believe he associated that when it
 
02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
went back to the town for the additional
 
02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:05.670 align:start position:0%
went back to the town for the additional
um

02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:07.190 --> 02:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
revenue it wasn't supported through a
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
warrant article
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
and the project never had had moved
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
forward so
 
02:22:15.190 --> 02:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
with that at this update of the 10-year
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
plan and
 
02:22:19.750 --> 02:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
he had alluded to that as well to one of
 
02:22:21.910 --> 02:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
um i think council of gatsas's
 
02:22:24.309 --> 02:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
priorities as well was to
 
02:22:26.469 --> 02:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh make sure that that was included in
 
02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
the in the in the 10-year plan
 
02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:29.990 align:start position:0%
the in the in the 10-year plan
uh

02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:31.030 align:start position:0%
uh
i

02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:22:33.429 --> 02:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it has any town funds
 
02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
now that we're going to take it on we're
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
going to put it maybe there are some
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
residual state aid highway funds i'll
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
have to check but essentially it's been
 
02:22:42.389 --> 02:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
put in the federal program to to to do
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
that intersection
 
02:22:47.110 --> 02:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh it is programmed in in he said 2026 i
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
believe that's right so
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
we also committed with that i know part
 
02:22:54.070 --> 02:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
of the concerns were also at the um a
 
02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
little bit further north at the main
 
02:22:58.230 --> 02:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
street intersection and 3a so both of
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
those intersections we're going to look
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
at as one 10-year plan project uh to uh
 
02:23:06.790 --> 02:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
to bring forward uh through the ten-year
 
02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:08.309 align:start position:0%
to bring forward uh through the ten-year
plan

02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
maybe a long answer but i think that's
 
02:23:12.870 --> 02:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
somewhat of the history and now defaulty
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
you're welcome and
 
02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
the issue before us is the removal of
 
02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
tolls not the rest of the 10-year
 
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
project in hooksett
 
02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
um just keep that in mind when we're
 
02:23:34.070 --> 02:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
contemplating what to do with this bill
 
02:23:35.910 --> 02:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
having said that are there any other
 
02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:37.349 align:start position:0%
having said that are there any other
questions

02:23:37.349 --> 02:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay sorry okay thank you
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
something you said earlier and i just
 
02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to be clear it sort of jumped out
 
02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
at me you said the
 
02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
we are losing 118 million dollars is
 
02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
that just the turnpike system and for
 
02:23:58.710 --> 02:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
how long or the entire
 
02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:00.710 align:start position:0%
how long or the entire
budget

02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:24:02.950 --> 02:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
that is just a turn fight system and
 
02:24:04.790 --> 02:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's due to covet because of reduced
 
02:24:08.230 --> 02:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
traffic and that is from fiscal year 20
 
02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
to fiscal year 30. and that's based on
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
our previous estimate prior to covit our
 
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
traffic and revenue study into our
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
revised one after covet okay follow up
 
02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
okay everybody hear me
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
okay so what
 
02:24:30.389 --> 02:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
time period is that loss again i just
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
want to be clear i was a little confused
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
sorry fiscal year 20 which started in uh
 
02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:39.750 align:start position:0%
sorry fiscal year 20 which started in uh
july

02:24:39.750 --> 02:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
july
 
02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
1st of 2019 and then it goes to fiscal
 
02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:43.670 align:start position:0%
1st of 2019 and then it goes to fiscal
year

02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:24:46.550 --> 02:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
30 which ends in june 30th
 
02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:47.389 align:start position:0%
30 which ends in june 30th
uh

02:24:47.389 --> 02:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:24:47.399 --> 02:24:48.950 align:start position:0%
uh
2030.

02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
2030.
 
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
so this is i mean it's a 10-year period
 
02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
yeah like approximately 10 years about
 
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%

distance
 
03:46:05.110 --> 03:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a gasoline-powered vehicle
 
03:46:06.790 --> 03:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
each electric vehicle
 
03:46:09.990 --> 03:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
can carry 136
 
03:46:13.990 --> 03:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
can travel 136 miles for the 32 miles
 
03:46:17.110 --> 03:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
that a gas powered vehicle can go on one
 
03:46:18.630 --> 03:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
gallon of gas
 
03:46:22.070 --> 03:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
my source for this is the epa
 
03:46:23.670 --> 03:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
given the current gas tax in new
 
03:46:26.389 --> 03:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire 24 cents a gallon a gas
 
03:46:28.990 --> 03:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle will cost you a dollar two to go
 
03:46:31.990 --> 03:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
136 miles and the bill asks for the
 
03:46:33.990 --> 03:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
owners of electric vehicles to pay only
 
03:46:37.110 --> 03:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
50 cents for the same mileage although
 
03:46:39.030 --> 03:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
it seems that electric vehicle owners
 
03:46:41.189 --> 03:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
get a substantial discount over a gas
 
03:46:43.349 --> 03:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle they deserve it as they will
 
03:46:45.750 --> 03:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
emit no carbon footprint although they
 
03:46:47.030 --> 03:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
need to pay something for new
 
03:46:49.110 --> 03:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire's roads and bridges and
 
03:46:51.429 --> 03:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
gas-powered owners need an incentive as
 
03:46:53.910 --> 03:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
well to purchase electric vehicles
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
both gm and chrysler have announced that
 
03:46:57.750 --> 03:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
they will no longer produce
 
03:47:01.510 --> 03:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
internal combustion engines after 2035.
 
03:47:03.429 --> 03:47:03.439 align:start position:0%
this bill is a simple short-term
 
03:47:06.150 --> 03:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
solution to a long-term problem i hope
 
03:47:07.750 --> 03:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
that the legislature will come up with a
 
03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
permanent long-term solution within the
 
03:47:12.309 --> 03:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
next couple of years in this bill can
 
03:47:12.319 --> 03:47:13.590 align:start position:0%
next couple of years in this bill can
sunset

03:47:13.590 --> 03:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
sunset
 
03:47:15.910 --> 03:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
you can use these comparisons assuming
 
03:47:19.189 --> 03:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
50 cent 50 percent of the vehicles
 
03:47:22.229 --> 03:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
use use is off turnpike
 
03:47:24.229 --> 03:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
and if someone uses their electric
 
03:47:26.389 --> 03:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
vehicle twelve thousand miles a year on
 
03:47:28.870 --> 03:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
the road system it'll cost them roughly
 
03:47:31.269 --> 03:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
six hundred and sixty six dollars
 
03:47:34.630 --> 03:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
based on 136 mile per toll use
 
03:47:37.349 --> 03:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
if someone uses their gas vehicle 12 000
 
03:47:39.429 --> 03:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
miles a year in the road system with 50
 
03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
percent off turnpike it will cost them
 
03:47:42.560 --> 03:47:44.150 align:start position:0%
percent off turnpike it will cost them
1440.

03:47:44.150 --> 03:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
1440.
 
03:47:48.229 --> 03:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
based on 136 miles per use
 
03:47:50.070 --> 03:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
i have a couple of comments that have
 
03:47:53.349 --> 03:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
resisted this formula
 
03:47:56.469 --> 03:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
opposed to the registration to uh
 
03:47:58.830 --> 03:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
and supported original or
 
03:48:02.070 --> 03:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
additional registration fees or a fee by
 
03:48:03.830 --> 03:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
weight of the vehicle i don't believe
 
03:48:06.229 --> 03:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
either of these ideas will work for the
 
03:48:08.070 --> 03:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
registration fee
 
03:48:09.750 --> 03:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
to work one would have to know how many
 
03:48:12.550 --> 03:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
miles a year a vehicle travels
 
03:48:14.790 --> 03:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
in order to calculate the gas tax with
 
03:48:17.110 --> 03:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
relation to the registration fee i
 
03:48:19.349 --> 03:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
believe that's undeterminable
 
03:48:21.269 --> 03:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
for the weight system to work the value
 
03:48:22.630 --> 03:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
of a pound
 
03:48:24.790 --> 03:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
to the cost of the gas tax on each
 
03:48:26.790 --> 03:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
individual combined with a calculation
 
03:48:28.790 --> 03:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
of how a pound of weight would affect
 
03:48:31.269 --> 03:48:31.279 align:start position:0%
the damage to the road system i believe
 
03:48:34.469 --> 03:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
is also indeterminable
 
03:48:36.630 --> 03:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony mr chairman if
 
03:48:38.150 --> 03:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
anyone has any questions i'll do the
 
03:48:40.469 --> 03:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
best i can to answer them
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
questions from members of the committee
 
03:48:47.349 --> 03:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
representative faulkner
 
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
well my understanding is that the
 
03:48:51.429 --> 03:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
toll tags can be used on multiple
 
03:48:53.110 --> 03:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles and some people have one tag
 
03:48:54.790 --> 03:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
that can be shared by several vehicles
 
03:48:54.800 --> 03:48:55.510 align:start position:0%
that can be shared by several vehicles
as

03:48:55.510 --> 03:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:48:57.990 --> 03:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
you thought of a way that
 
03:49:01.269 --> 03:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
could restrict the use of a tag to
 
03:49:03.030 --> 03:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
so that it okay
 
03:49:06.389 --> 03:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:08.150 --> 03:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:11.670 --> 03:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
further questions um one question and
 
03:49:15.030 --> 03:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
you may want to defer to the department
 
03:49:16.870 --> 03:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
when they testify
 
03:49:21.030 --> 03:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:23.830 --> 03:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
out of state vehicles that are ev how
 
03:49:23.840 --> 03:49:25.349 align:start position:0%
out of state vehicles that are ev how
would

03:49:25.349 --> 03:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:49:28.550 --> 03:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
our toll collectors with ezpass know
 
03:49:35.110 --> 03:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
i was told that the
 
03:49:40.150 --> 03:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
the easy pass system has that
 
03:49:43.189 --> 03:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
information in their databases and it is
 
03:49:43.199 --> 03:49:45.670 align:start position:0%
information in their databases and it is
accessible

03:49:45.670 --> 03:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
but there would be a fee to the state
 
03:49:51.030 --> 03:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
and the fee was unknown based on
 
03:49:55.269 --> 03:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:57.429 --> 03:49:57.439 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from members
 
03:50:01.349 --> 03:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:03.750 --> 03:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call kelly buchanan and

03:50:11.670 --> 03:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
03:50:13.750 --> 03:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
committee good to see you again today my
 
03:50:15.349 --> 03:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
name is kelly buchanan director of
 
03:50:17.349 --> 03:50:17.359 align:start position:0%

clean energy new hampshire
 
03:50:20.710 --> 03:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
and i will keep my testimony very brief
 
03:50:22.309 --> 03:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
this morning in light of what i shared
 
03:50:23.750 --> 03:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
with you this morning in regards to
 
03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 1040.
 
03:50:27.429 --> 03:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
but while we don't disagree that eb
 
03:50:29.189 --> 03:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
should certainly pay their fair share or
 
03:50:30.870 --> 03:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
their equitable share of maintaining our
 
03:50:32.710 --> 03:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
roads and bridges we feel this bill is a
 
03:50:32.720 --> 03:50:33.590 align:start position:0%
roads and bridges we feel this bill is a
little

03:50:33.590 --> 03:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
little
 
03:50:35.510 --> 03:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
a little early in the process it would
 
03:50:37.670 --> 03:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate to quickly determine
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
a consensus solution to some sort of an
 
03:50:40.319 --> 03:50:41.510 align:start position:0%
a consensus solution to some sort of an
alternative

03:50:41.510 --> 03:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
03:50:43.349 --> 03:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
to the road toll in that study
 
03:50:44.870 --> 03:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
commission that was proposed in house
 
03:50:46.229 --> 03:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
bill 1040.
 
03:50:47.990 --> 03:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
so i would be happy to take any of your
 
03:50:48.000 --> 03:50:49.269 align:start position:0%
so i would be happy to take any of your
questions

03:50:49.269 --> 03:50:49.279 align:start position:0%

good afternoon chairman members of the

committee
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
the d.o.t has no position on this bill
 
03:51:26.550 --> 03:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
although we do have some operational
 
03:51:28.550 --> 03:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
concerns with it
 
03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
presently our account our easy pass

us if their vehicle is electric
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
also this bill is being
 
03:51:40.710 --> 03:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
tied to a tag a transponder
 
03:51:42.950 --> 03:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
several householders households might
 
03:51:44.469 --> 03:51:44.479 align:start position:0%
not only have one transponder and they
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
move between cars
 
03:51:47.349 --> 03:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
so that means
 
03:51:49.830 --> 03:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
a non-electric vehicle would be charged
 
03:51:51.750 --> 03:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
that surcharge
 
03:51:53.990 --> 03:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
we also foresee customers forgetting to
 
03:51:56.389 --> 03:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
update their accounts when they get rid
 
03:51:58.950 --> 03:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
of their electric vehicle and then
 
03:52:00.469 --> 03:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
there'll be additional
 
03:52:04.150 --> 03:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
one reimbursement for the excess charge
 
03:52:06.309 --> 03:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
we also believe the bill isn't fair to
 
03:52:08.309 --> 03:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents because majority
 
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
of them are
 
03:52:10.830 --> 03:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
easy pass
 
03:52:13.110 --> 03:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
customers new hampshire easy pass
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
customers will only be getting a charge
 
03:52:16.630 --> 03:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
not an easy pass
 
03:52:18.229 --> 03:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
non-new hampshire easy pass customers
 
03:52:21.349 --> 03:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
will not be getting a charge
 
03:52:23.429 --> 03:52:23.439 align:start position:0%
also the cash customers on a turnpike
 
03:52:24.830 --> 03:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
don't get
 
03:52:27.349 --> 03:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
charged the electric
 
03:52:29.590 --> 03:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles also are not being charged
 
03:52:31.750 --> 03:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
outside the turnpike in other state
 
03:52:34.150 --> 03:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
highway systems
 
03:52:35.670 --> 03:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
the cost of the
 
03:52:37.910 --> 03:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
the bill was indeterminal because we are
 
03:52:39.670 --> 03:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
unsure of how many electric vehicle
 
03:52:43.830 --> 03:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
users have accounts in the ezpass system
 
03:52:45.830 --> 03:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
we also know there will be additional
 
03:52:47.910 --> 03:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
costs but there was undeterminable if
 
03:52:49.670 --> 03:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
the bill is passed changes to our easy
 
03:52:51.349 --> 03:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
pass system
 
03:52:53.750 --> 03:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
also the website application we'd also
 
03:52:56.070 --> 03:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
have to create a file of transferring
 
03:52:56.080 --> 03:52:56.870 align:start position:0%
have to create a file of transferring
the

03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:52:58.550 --> 03:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
turnpike funds
 
03:53:01.510 --> 03:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
into the highway fund
 
03:53:03.510 --> 03:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
and there will also be a future
 
03:53:05.269 --> 03:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
problem of administrator cost of dealing
 
03:53:06.870 --> 03:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
with customers not updating their
 
03:53:10.389 --> 03:53:10.399 align:start position:0%
accounts and also auditing the fund
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
transfer with the turnpike funds to the
 
03:53:14.630 --> 03:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
03:53:17.510 --> 03:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions
 
03:53:18.790 --> 03:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:53:21.030 --> 03:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative jack
 
03:53:22.630 --> 03:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:53:24.790 --> 03:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
for coming in uh i believe this is the
 
03:53:26.550 --> 03:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
first case that we've had where we've
 
03:53:28.150 --> 03:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
considered having part of toll
 
03:53:30.150 --> 03:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
collections go somewhere other than the
 
03:53:32.150 --> 03:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
turnpike fund is that
 
03:53:39.030 --> 03:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:39.040 --> 03:53:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:53:41.510 --> 03:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:43.429 --> 03:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
i can't directly answer i believe it
 
03:53:43.439 --> 03:53:44.229 align:start position:0%
i can't directly answer i believe it
would

03:53:44.229 --> 03:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:53:45.510 --> 03:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
create an issue because it's on the
 
03:53:48.389 --> 03:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
turnpike system but with the law intact
 
03:53:51.349 --> 03:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
in maine not i can't totally agree with
 
03:53:51.359 --> 03:53:55.590 align:start position:0%
in maine not i can't totally agree with
that

03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:58.870 --> 03:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
first representative boyd
 
03:54:01.030 --> 03:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:54:01.040 --> 03:54:01.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
how

03:54:01.830 --> 03:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
how
 
03:54:01.840 --> 03:54:03.110 align:start position:0%
how
easy

03:54:03.110 --> 03:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
easy
 
03:54:04.469 --> 03:54:04.479 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
03:54:06.550 --> 03:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
to code a transponder
 
03:54:09.750 --> 03:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
by license plate to the applicable
 
03:54:11.990 --> 03:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle being driven concerning that
 
03:54:14.550 --> 03:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
tesla to my knowledge is the only pure
 
03:54:22.710 --> 03:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:24.070 --> 03:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
03:54:25.990 --> 03:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
extremely hard
 
03:54:27.910 --> 03:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
the vendor who sells the transponders
 
03:54:30.070 --> 03:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
they do not do that now
 
03:54:32.950 --> 03:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
it would require that vendor to make a
 
03:54:36.630 --> 03:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
complete change in the transponders
 
03:54:39.750 --> 03:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from members
 
03:54:44.630 --> 03:54:44.640 align:start position:0%

03:54:51.670 --> 03:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
i have no other pink cards is anybody
 
03:54:53.590 --> 03:54:53.600 align:start position:0%

03:54:58.630 --> 03:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1675 wish to speak
 
03:55:00.710 --> 03:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
anybody who has spoken once wished to
 
03:55:02.469 --> 03:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
speak a second time
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
saying none i will close the public
 
03:55:08.790 --> 03:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill 1675.
 
03:55:11.830 --> 03:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
and once again i must judge the time
 
03:55:14.710 --> 03:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
and we do not have a further
 
03:55:16.630 --> 03:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
another hearing until
 
03:55:18.630 --> 03:55:18.640 align:start position:0%

weeks of the gasset phase of the 10-year

plan and so
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
in our first presentation last week we
 
04:18:38.790 --> 04:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
tried to

we're going to focus more on the content
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the 10-year plan and the strategies
 
04:18:53.830 --> 04:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
that were supported by the executive
 
04:18:56.389 --> 04:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
council when they met as gasset as we
 
04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
developed first the draft that we use
 
04:19:00.389 --> 04:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of
 
04:19:02.550 --> 04:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
receiving public testimony
 
04:19:03.990 --> 04:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
and then the strategies that were
 
04:19:04.000 --> 04:19:06.229 align:start position:0%
and then the strategies that were
further

04:19:06.229 --> 04:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:19:07.910 --> 04:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
used to help
 
04:19:09.830 --> 04:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
identify where the additional investment
 
04:19:12.630 --> 04:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
provided by the federal bill should be
 
04:19:13.830 --> 04:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
made so

um
 
04:20:34.630 --> 04:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
we go through the those changes in the
 
04:20:36.550 --> 04:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
change table
 
04:20:38.469 --> 04:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
and then a few of the items that we
 
04:20:40.389 --> 04:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that
 
04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
were brought up

dollars
the

04:21:34.830 --> 04:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh column immediately to the right five
 
04:21:40.870 --> 04:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
year prior appropriations this includes
 
04:21:40.880 --> 04:21:41.590 align:start position:0%

the
 
04:21:44.550 --> 04:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
the funding and the fast act that was um
 
04:21:47.590 --> 04:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
for the for a previous five-year
 
04:21:47.600 --> 04:21:48.870 align:start position:0%

plan
 
04:21:51.110 --> 04:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh and and you look the bottom line
 
04:21:52.950 --> 04:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
total there for transportation is one
 
04:21:54.870 --> 04:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
million uh just a little over one
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars so if you subtract that
 
04:21:59.030 --> 04:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
second column from the first column you
 
04:22:00.309 --> 04:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
get the new
 
04:22:03.349 --> 04:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
money in the um
 
04:22:05.670 --> 04:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
represented here in the uh

the following uh column is what has been
 
04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
included in the draft and the book that
 
04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
you have in front of you right now one
 
04:22:24.309 --> 04:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
point just under 1.5 billion dollars
 
04:22:26.389 --> 04:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of categories on on the
 
04:22:28.870 --> 04:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
public trans transportation and the
 
04:22:30.630 --> 04:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
airport side
 
04:22:32.309 --> 04:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
we we haven't had we don't have enough
 
04:22:34.550 --> 04:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
information on those um
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
on those funds yet so they haven't have
 
04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
not been included in
 
04:22:41.910 --> 04:22:41.920 align:start position:0%

04:24:45.990 --> 04:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
funded the regional priority project so
 
04:24:48.309 --> 04:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
there's 50 million dollars
 
04:24:50.950 --> 04:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
allocated to the last two years of the
 
04:24:53.670 --> 04:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
of the the draft 10-year plan and that's
 
04:24:55.110 --> 04:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
distributed amongst the regional
 
04:24:57.590 --> 04:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
planning commissions 25 million uh for
 
04:25:01.030 --> 04:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
each year and those um that process that
 
04:25:02.309 --> 04:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
we went through
 
04:25:05.269 --> 04:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
um utilized that 50 million dollars to
 
04:25:08.469 --> 04:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
fund new projects into the plan
 
04:25:10.630 --> 04:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
another strategy was we wanted to focus
 
04:25:12.229 --> 04:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
on maintenance and preservation of the
 
04:25:17.030 --> 04:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
existing network of roads and bridges
 
04:25:19.110 --> 04:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
we continue to invest in core system
 
04:25:19.120 --> 04:25:20.870 align:start position:0%
we continue to invest in core system
programs

04:25:20.870 --> 04:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:25:22.070 --> 04:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
and build on
 
04:25:23.830 --> 04:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
previous successes and by the
 
04:25:26.309 --> 04:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
investments in these programs those
 
04:25:28.469 --> 04:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
include pavement and bridge preservation
 
04:25:28.479 --> 04:25:29.830 align:start position:0%
include pavement and bridge preservation
programs

04:25:29.830 --> 04:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:25:29.840 --> 04:25:31.110 align:start position:0%
programs
our

04:25:31.110 --> 04:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:25:33.189 --> 04:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
rehab and reconstruction of redless
 
04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
bridges and we wanted to accelerate the
 
04:25:37.349 --> 04:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
overall removal of those and our target
 
04:25:39.750 --> 04:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
would be to try to
 
04:25:39.760 --> 04:25:41.110 align:start position:0%
would be to try to
remove

04:25:41.110 --> 04:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
remove
 
04:25:43.750 --> 04:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
all existing redless bridges within a
 
04:25:46.070 --> 04:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
seven six to seven year time period
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
instead of extending those out through
 
04:25:51.189 --> 04:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
the entire 10-year plan so accelerate
 
04:25:53.110 --> 04:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
them where we can
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
and we continue to invest in in overall
 
04:25:58.229 --> 04:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
road roadside assets including culverts
 
04:26:02.950 --> 04:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
guard rail pavement markings and signs
 
04:26:05.429 --> 04:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
next bullet uh federal reauthorization
 
04:26:08.229 --> 04:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
so we had at this point the iija hadn't
 
04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
been approved and we were assuming uh
 
04:26:11.590 --> 04:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
that there was going to be some
 
04:26:13.510 --> 04:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
additional funds and these bullets
 
04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
identify how we plan to utilize those
 
04:26:18.309 --> 04:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
additional funds from a prioritization
 
04:26:18.319 --> 04:26:20.630 align:start position:0%
additional funds from a prioritization
standpoint

04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
04:26:23.590 --> 04:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
we wanted to accelerate existing 10-year
 
04:26:26.790 --> 04:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
plan projects where possible
 
04:26:28.630 --> 04:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
fully fund
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
scope constrained uh 10-year plan
 
04:26:33.990 --> 04:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
projects that are currently in the plan
 
04:26:36.630 --> 04:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
convert garvey bonded projects to
 
04:26:40.070 --> 04:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:44.070 --> 04:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
modify existing programs in uh by
 
04:26:45.510 --> 04:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
adjusting funding to include
 
04:26:49.030 --> 04:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
inflationary um uh adjustments overall
 
04:26:51.670 --> 04:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
in the in the uh in the programs
 
04:26:53.429 --> 04:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
and then we would consider new projects
 
04:26:55.590 --> 04:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
in the outer years to improve safety and
 
04:26:55.600 --> 04:27:00.389 align:start position:0%
in the outer years to improve safety and
capacity

04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:01.910 --> 04:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
this next
 
04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
slide if if i could just ask one quick
 
04:27:05.040 --> 04:27:06.229 align:start position:0%
slide if if i could just ask one quick
question

04:27:06.229 --> 04:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with with what
 
04:27:07.920 --> 04:27:08.870 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with with what
you're

04:27:08.870 --> 04:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:27:13.349 --> 04:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
talking but is this presentation
 
04:27:15.670 --> 04:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
currently up on your website
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
it is not posted yet okay i was just
 
04:27:20.469 --> 04:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
wondering for people who are trying to
 
04:27:22.870 --> 04:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
watch us online if there was a way that
 
04:27:26.630 --> 04:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
they could follow along but take notes
 
04:27:35.990 --> 04:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:40.309 --> 04:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
so moving on to the next slide um
 
04:27:42.070 --> 04:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
strategies for
 
04:27:45.670 --> 04:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
overall highway programs
 
04:27:45.680 --> 04:27:48.229 align:start position:0%
overall highway programs
so

04:27:48.229 --> 04:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:50.309 --> 04:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
some of the changes
 
04:27:52.389 --> 04:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
that were included in the giraffe the
 
04:27:55.269 --> 04:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
original draft in september we had an
 
04:27:58.309 --> 04:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
increase in pavement investment by 168
 
04:28:00.149 --> 04:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
million dollars and that's over the the
 
04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
10-year period
 
04:28:04.790 --> 04:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
increases in
 
04:28:07.349 --> 04:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
bridge investment for the state assets
 
04:28:10.070 --> 04:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
state-owned bridges of 169
 
04:28:12.149 --> 04:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
million dollars and the breakdown for
 
04:28:14.950 --> 04:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
those increases are shown in the bullets
 
04:28:14.960 --> 04:28:18.309 align:start position:0%
those increases are shown in the bullets
below

04:28:18.309 --> 04:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:19.910 --> 04:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
we converted
 
04:28:22.070 --> 04:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
projects funded with garvey funds and
 
04:28:25.349 --> 04:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a federal um
 
04:28:29.510 --> 04:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
bond program that uses future uh federal
 
04:28:31.590 --> 04:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh obligational authority to pay debt
 
04:28:36.469 --> 04:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
service we had 163 million dollars in in
 
04:28:38.149 --> 04:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
garvey bonds that were funding a number
 
04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
of projects
 
04:28:41.910 --> 04:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
and uh net the debt service that was
 
04:28:44.149 --> 04:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
included in the current 10-year plan on
 
04:28:46.710 --> 04:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
those garvey bonds of 105 million the
 
04:28:49.349 --> 04:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
increase uh to the plan was 58 million
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:55.110 --> 04:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
i wanted to fully fund scope constrained
 
04:28:57.750 --> 04:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
projects that added 54 million dollars
 
04:29:00.870 --> 04:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
and if we go to the next slide
 
04:29:02.550 --> 04:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see a
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
list of projects
 
04:29:06.950 --> 04:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
that make up that 54 million so there
 
04:29:08.469 --> 04:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
were a number of projects that we had
 
04:29:11.030 --> 04:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
identified in the current 10-year plan
 
04:29:14.790 --> 04:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:17.429 --> 04:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
the scope of work in order to fit the
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
budget that we had
 
04:29:21.030 --> 04:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
available to us
 
04:29:22.630 --> 04:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
and by
 
04:29:23.990 --> 04:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
having this
 
04:29:26.950 --> 04:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
additional federal funding
 
04:29:29.030 --> 04:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
available we were identifying these
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
projects and then adding funds to those
 
04:29:34.870 --> 04:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
existing 10-year plan projects to get us
 
04:29:38.229 --> 04:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
closer to if not at the original scope
 
04:29:40.149 --> 04:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
of work what was intended
 
04:29:43.110 --> 04:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
when the when the project came in to the
 
04:29:45.269 --> 04:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
to the plan and i'm not going to go
 
04:29:47.990 --> 04:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
through and um
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
list all of these but it gives you some
 
04:29:51.189 --> 04:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
sense for
 
04:29:53.349 --> 04:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
which projects and how much additional
 
04:29:55.670 --> 04:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
funds we we included in the original
 
04:30:02.630 --> 04:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:06.790 --> 04:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:06.800 --> 04:30:07.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:30:07.750 --> 04:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
at this point in time
 
04:30:13.830 --> 04:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
we had learned that the
 
04:30:15.910 --> 04:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
had had passed
 
04:30:19.750 --> 04:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
and this was a second piece of funding
 
04:30:19.760 --> 04:30:20.630 align:start position:0%
and this was a second piece of funding
so

04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:30:23.110 --> 04:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
if you go to page
 
04:30:25.030 --> 04:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
page three in the presentation the
 
04:30:29.510 --> 04:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
bridge program this 225 million dollars
 
04:30:32.469 --> 04:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
in the original draft that 225 million
 
04:30:34.710 --> 04:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
dollars was not included so these are
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
changes that we made
 
04:30:41.269 --> 04:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
as a result of the passing of the iija
 
04:30:44.070 --> 04:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
so we are allocating 15
 
04:30:46.950 --> 04:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
of that 45 million dollars per year so
 
04:30:49.590 --> 04:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's a five-year program 225 million
 
04:30:52.550 --> 04:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
dollars 45 million dollars per year 15
 
04:30:55.510 --> 04:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
of that to the municipal bridge program
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
6.7 million dollars
 
04:30:59.750 --> 04:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
and the balance
 
04:31:02.229 --> 04:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
of that 45 million dollars per year that
 
04:31:04.710 --> 04:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
was coming in
 
04:31:07.189 --> 04:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
we would allocate to existing bridge
 
04:31:09.590 --> 04:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
projects and what that would do is that
 
04:31:11.349 --> 04:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
would free up funds
 
04:31:13.429 --> 04:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
that were allocated to those bridge
 
04:31:15.590 --> 04:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
projects to use on other projects so
 
04:31:17.349 --> 04:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's more flexible
 
04:31:17.359 --> 04:31:19.269 align:start position:0%
it's more flexible
overall

04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
overall
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
and the bullets here below that will
 
04:31:23.670 --> 04:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
increase the mandated programs to align
 
04:31:25.590 --> 04:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
with the increased apportionment it was
 
04:31:29.269 --> 04:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
about 7.3 million dollars a year for
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
some of these programs highway safety
 
04:31:31.439 --> 04:31:32.790 align:start position:0%
some of these programs highway safety
improvement

04:31:32.790 --> 04:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
transportation alternatives programs
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
cmac rec trails etc
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
we funded administrative project changes
 
04:31:41.349 --> 04:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
and we'll go through those in a few
 
04:31:41.359 --> 04:31:42.710 align:start position:0%
and we'll go through those in a few
slides

04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
slides
 
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
and also there were a number of
 
04:31:47.990 --> 04:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
projects that had
 
04:31:50.149 --> 04:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
scope or cost increases that we're aware
 
04:31:53.590 --> 04:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
of and additional increases based on
 
04:31:55.590 --> 04:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
input that we received
 
04:31:56.550 --> 04:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
at the
 
04:32:00.229 --> 04:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:00.239 --> 04:32:01.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:32:01.030 --> 04:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:03.349 --> 04:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
additional strategy
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
on the next next slide slide nine
 
04:32:08.070 --> 04:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
the electrical
 
04:32:11.429 --> 04:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle um charging program so
 
04:32:14.229 --> 04:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure program 17 million
 
04:32:16.630 --> 04:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
dollars in in new funds
 
04:32:18.790 --> 04:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh three and a half million dollars per
 
04:32:20.950 --> 04:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
year for a five-year period we created
 
04:32:23.670 --> 04:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
an ev program that's included in the
 
04:32:25.269 --> 04:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
current 10-year
 
04:32:29.110 --> 04:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:31.110 --> 04:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
from a public transportation standpoint
 
04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
there's 33 and a half million dollars in
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
new funds and the allocations across
 
04:32:38.790 --> 04:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
individual fta programs are not uh
 
04:32:40.469 --> 04:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
currently known we only know the
 
04:32:40.479 --> 04:32:41.990 align:start position:0%
currently known we only know the
apportionments

04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
apportionments
 
04:32:45.830 --> 04:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
however 15 million of the total of 33.5
 
04:32:47.750 --> 04:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars are not included in the
 
04:32:49.910 --> 04:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
draft and the and this is uh funding
 
04:32:51.670 --> 04:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
that will get included as we learn more
 
04:32:56.550 --> 04:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:59.469 --> 04:32:59.479 align:start position:0%
similarly on the airports uh anticipate
 
04:33:03.110 --> 04:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
45.6 million dollars in new funds um the
 
04:33:05.189 --> 04:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
faa projects are not part of the surface
 
04:33:07.670 --> 04:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
transportation bill and the new funds
 
04:33:10.150 --> 04:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
are not included in this draft and uh
 
04:33:12.070 --> 04:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
will be at a later date once we learn
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:17.830 --> 04:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
i wanted to mention active
 
04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
transportation we hear a lot about a lot
 
04:33:21.750 --> 04:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
of comments about
 
04:33:23.750 --> 04:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
active transportation throughout the
 
04:33:26.390 --> 04:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
hearing process
 
04:33:29.029 --> 04:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
we invest approximately in this draft
 
04:33:32.070 --> 04:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
around 17 million dollars per year on
 
04:33:35.429 --> 04:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
average uh for the 10-year uh period
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:33:39.029 --> 04:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
we were asked to provide more
 
04:33:41.109 --> 04:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
transparency in how
 
04:33:43.349 --> 04:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
those investments were being made for
 
04:33:46.629 --> 04:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
this category so we created a new a new
 
04:33:48.709 --> 04:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
category and and some of our funding
 
04:33:50.629 --> 04:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
charts so that it would be called out
 
04:33:53.189 --> 04:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
and and it would be clear how much
 
04:33:57.189 --> 04:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
we expected to spend for this category
 
04:34:02.551 --> 04:34:02.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:05.189 --> 04:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
next slide slide 10.
 
04:34:05.199 --> 04:34:06.070 align:start position:0%
next slide slide 10.
so

04:34:06.070 --> 04:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:07.910 --> 04:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
and we had mentioned this last time we
 
04:34:09.990 --> 04:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
were here we had
 
04:34:12.629 --> 04:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
22 public hearings and we also held one
 
04:34:15.830 --> 04:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
um all virtual uh hearing again to
 
04:34:15.840 --> 04:34:16.789 align:start position:0%
um all virtual uh hearing again to
gather

04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
gather
 
04:34:19.510 --> 04:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
um input on the draft 10-year plan the
 
04:34:21.189 --> 04:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
september version of the draft 10-year
 
04:34:21.199 --> 04:34:22.551 align:start position:0%
september version of the draft 10-year
plan

04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:34:24.869 --> 04:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
and that was a
 
04:34:28.551 --> 04:34:28.561 align:start position:0%
pretty busy uh five or six weeks of uh
 
04:34:31.510 --> 04:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
of uh hearings and and uh we collected a
 
04:34:32.789 --> 04:34:32.799 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
04:34:36.310 --> 04:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of testimony uh across uh uh
 
04:34:36.320 --> 04:34:37.990 align:start position:0%
a lot of testimony uh across uh uh
statewide

04:34:37.990 --> 04:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
04:34:41.590 --> 04:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
go to slide 11 um we also
 
04:34:43.349 --> 04:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
created a
 
04:34:45.189 --> 04:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
online survey
 
04:34:47.910 --> 04:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
again to reach those who may not be able
 
04:34:50.709 --> 04:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
to attend the hearings and to
 
04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
try to get as much feedback on and
 
04:34:55.189 --> 04:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
commentary on the draft 10-year plan as
 
04:34:55.199 --> 04:34:56.869 align:start position:0%
commentary on the draft 10-year plan as
possible

04:34:56.869 --> 04:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:34:59.109 --> 04:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
overall the conclusions of the survey
 
04:35:00.390 --> 04:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
that the public's
 
04:35:01.910 --> 04:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
support for the department's strategic
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
direction and priorities for
 
04:35:05.189 --> 04:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
transportation investments was there we
 
04:35:07.109 --> 04:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
saw that in the
 
04:35:11.269 --> 04:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:13.029 --> 04:35:13.039 align:start position:0%
slide 12
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
this shows um a graphics um so the
 
04:35:19.990 --> 04:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
online survey is shown in blue on the
 
04:35:23.510 --> 04:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
left and there were 760 online surveys
 
04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
that were completed
 
04:35:26.629 --> 04:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
and on the right
 
04:35:29.750 --> 04:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
there were 456 hearing comments that we
 
04:35:32.709 --> 04:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
received as part of the hearing process
 
04:35:35.910 --> 04:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
each one the categories for both we
 
04:35:39.189 --> 04:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
tried to capture um and and and
 
04:35:42.230 --> 04:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
categorize the comments that we received
 
04:35:44.230 --> 04:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
and these five
 
04:35:47.590 --> 04:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
were some of those very
 
04:35:50.150 --> 04:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
general uh categories that we wanted to
 
04:35:50.160 --> 04:35:51.910 align:start position:0%
general uh categories that we wanted to
use

04:35:51.910 --> 04:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
use
 
04:35:54.789 --> 04:35:54.799 align:start position:0%
and what was clear is expanding travel
 
04:35:54.799 --> 04:35:56.470 align:start position:0%
and what was clear is expanding travel
options

04:35:56.470 --> 04:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
options
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
the commentary that we received both
 
04:36:01.349 --> 04:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
online and in the hearing we received
 
04:36:04.390 --> 04:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
most comments on expanding travel
 
04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
options and
 
04:36:08.789 --> 04:36:08.799 align:start position:0%
as you go to the right improve safety
 
04:36:11.029 --> 04:36:11.039 align:start position:0%
maintaining the system reduce congestion
 
04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
enhance system resiliency you'll see
 
04:36:13.680 --> 04:36:14.470 align:start position:0%
enhance system resiliency you'll see
that

04:36:14.470 --> 04:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:36:17.269 --> 04:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
from a prioritization standpoint
 
04:36:19.590 --> 04:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
a higher priority of the or the the
 
04:36:21.029 --> 04:36:21.039 align:start position:0%
number of comments that we received were
 
04:36:22.470 --> 04:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
higher to the left
 
04:36:22.480 --> 04:36:23.349 align:start position:0%
higher to the left
and

04:36:23.349 --> 04:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:25.830 --> 04:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
as you proceed to the categories to the
 
04:36:25.840 --> 04:36:27.429 align:start position:0%
as you proceed to the categories to the
right

04:36:27.429 --> 04:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:36:30.070 --> 04:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
the the lesser amount of commentary
 
04:36:30.080 --> 04:36:30.830 align:start position:0%
the the lesser amount of commentary
was

04:36:30.830 --> 04:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:36:33.990 --> 04:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
provided again strong advocacy for
 
04:36:36.150 --> 04:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
expanding travel options and then
 
04:36:38.230 --> 04:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
followed by improving safety maintaining
 
04:36:40.789 --> 04:36:40.799 align:start position:0%
the system and reducing congestion
 
04:36:43.189 --> 04:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
we also heard a lot about specific
 
04:36:44.629 --> 04:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
project needs
 
04:36:47.990 --> 04:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
um within each one of the hearings that
 
04:36:49.510 --> 04:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
we did
 
04:36:49.520 --> 04:36:53.670 align:start position:0%
we did
hold

04:36:53.670 --> 04:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh one one moment
 
04:36:56.400 --> 04:36:57.189 align:start position:0%
uh one one moment
would

04:36:57.189 --> 04:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:36:59.269 --> 04:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
you prefer that we hold the questions
 
04:37:09.189 --> 04:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
representative query why don't we let
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
him get through and then we can go back
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
because it may get answered further on i
 
04:37:20.869 --> 04:37:20.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:24.709 --> 04:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
the next set of slides
 
04:37:25.910 --> 04:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
go through
 
04:37:25.920 --> 04:37:27.029 align:start position:0%
go through
the

04:37:27.029 --> 04:37:27.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:28.869 --> 04:37:28.879 align:start position:0%
project change list and these are
 
04:37:31.990 --> 04:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
changes that um
 
04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
we're documenting um
 
04:37:37.510 --> 04:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
following the initial draft in the
 
04:37:40.150 --> 04:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
september 17th version of the initial
 
04:37:41.670 --> 04:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
draft of the
 
04:37:43.990 --> 04:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
transportation plan this is kind of our
 
04:37:47.269 --> 04:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
change log um and there are various
 
04:37:49.189 --> 04:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
categories of changes i'm not going to
 
04:37:51.590 --> 04:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
go through each one on this list but
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is the this is the list that i
 
04:37:56.629 --> 04:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
provided a separate handout for you it's
 
04:37:59.830 --> 04:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
the same same information just in a in a
 
04:38:02.150 --> 04:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
separate uh package
 
04:38:04.949 --> 04:38:04.959 align:start position:0%
uh the first slide uh of the of the
 
04:38:07.269 --> 04:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
change is slide 13 and that these are
 
04:38:10.390 --> 04:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
administrative uh changes
 
04:38:13.349 --> 04:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
and many of these projects here
 
04:38:15.510 --> 04:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
um made it on to the administrative
 
04:38:18.310 --> 04:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
change list they were for instance the
 
04:38:20.109 --> 04:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
first one conway
 
04:38:22.949 --> 04:38:22.959 align:start position:0%
40638 this is a project that was
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
originally uh currently funded in the in
 
04:38:28.310 --> 04:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan in 2022
 
04:38:31.269 --> 04:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
but it was delayed until 2023 so we
 
04:38:33.029 --> 04:38:33.039 align:start position:0%
needed to make this administrative
 
04:38:35.910 --> 04:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
change so that would show up in this uh
 
04:38:38.789 --> 04:38:38.799 align:start position:0%
new draft so many of these are uh you'll
 
04:38:41.109 --> 04:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
note that they're similar similar in
 
04:38:42.551 --> 04:38:42.561 align:start position:0%
nature and that's why we call them the
 
04:38:44.230 --> 04:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
administrative changes they're already
 
04:38:45.830 --> 04:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
included in the plan we just wanted to
 
04:38:47.910 --> 04:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that they were included in the
 
04:38:52.310 --> 04:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:55.189 --> 04:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
moving on to slide 14
 
04:38:57.990 --> 04:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
additional administrative changes
 
04:38:58.000 --> 04:38:59.189 align:start position:0%
additional administrative changes
these

04:38:59.189 --> 04:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:39:02.629 --> 04:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
nine project listings were
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
bridge state state-owned bridge projects
 
04:39:08.470 --> 04:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
that we introduced
 
04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
in the draft as
 
04:39:13.990 --> 04:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
new new projects in the outer years
 
04:39:17.590 --> 04:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
and uh in an effort to accelerate them
 
04:39:20.230 --> 04:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
and try to remove the redless bridges
 
04:39:23.109 --> 04:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
faster than we had originally envisioned
 
04:39:24.789 --> 04:39:24.799 align:start position:0%
we accelerated these projects so they're
 
04:39:26.470 --> 04:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
really they were already included in the
 
04:39:26.480 --> 04:39:27.510 align:start position:0%
really they were already included in the
draft

04:39:27.510 --> 04:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
draft
 
04:39:29.189 --> 04:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
we just moved them
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
a year or two
 
04:39:33.670 --> 04:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
to remove them from the list sooner to
 
04:39:35.269 --> 04:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
get the work done sooner there are nine
 
04:39:40.230 --> 04:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:43.910 --> 04:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
slide 15 scope and cost adjustments so
 
04:39:43.920 --> 04:39:45.190 align:start position:0%
slide 15 scope and cost adjustments so
um

04:39:45.190 --> 04:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
during the the you know the summer
 
04:39:49.750 --> 04:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
months we um
 
04:39:52.948 --> 04:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
made aware of um scope adjustments in in
 
04:39:55.750 --> 04:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
existing projects and cost increases in
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
existing projects
 
04:39:58.708 --> 04:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to make sure that we
 
04:40:00.550 --> 04:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
captured those as part of the 10-year
 
04:40:04.868 --> 04:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
plan process um and so uh for instance
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
um one of these the first one here
 
04:40:10.230 --> 04:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
concord four one two one two
 
04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's a uh
 
04:40:14.230 --> 04:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
bridge rehabilitation project on on lown
 
04:40:15.430 --> 04:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
road over the
 
04:40:16.628 --> 04:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
over the
 
04:40:19.190 --> 04:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
merrimack river and we were made aware
 
04:40:20.948 --> 04:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
of a significant
 
04:40:23.910 --> 04:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
cost increase driven by a scope
 
04:40:26.628 --> 04:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
modification so in this case
 
04:40:29.030 --> 04:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
there was a 14 million dollar increase
 
04:40:31.190 --> 04:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
which brought the total project cost up
 
04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
to 22 million dollars so each one of
 
04:40:35.830 --> 04:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
these has a story i'm not going to go
 
04:40:38.070 --> 04:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
through it at this point but
 
04:40:40.230 --> 04:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
each one of these
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure that we
 
04:40:44.948 --> 04:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
documented the change from the the uh
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
the initial draft of the of the 2023-32
 
04:40:51.910 --> 04:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
plan that was presented at the hearings
 
04:40:56.830 --> 04:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
now slide 16 some more scope and cost
 
04:41:01.200 --> 04:41:02.948 align:start position:0%
now slide 16 some more scope and cost
adjustments

04:41:02.948 --> 04:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
04:41:05.190 --> 04:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
one of the ones that i will highlight
 
04:41:05.200 --> 04:41:07.990 align:start position:0%
one of the ones that i will highlight
here

04:41:07.990 --> 04:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:09.590 --> 04:41:09.600 align:start position:0%

four one seven two zero
 
04:41:16.868 --> 04:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
this particular change we increased the
 
04:41:18.868 --> 04:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire participation from 50
 
04:41:18.878 --> 04:41:20.070 align:start position:0%
new hampshire participation from 50

percent
 
04:41:22.628 --> 04:41:22.638 align:start position:0%
to 93 so this is the vilas bridge we
 
04:41:25.110 --> 04:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
have been funding that project at 50
 
04:41:27.270 --> 04:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
percent um
 
04:41:30.150 --> 04:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and fifty percent other
 
04:41:32.788 --> 04:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
um and and as part of the scope
 
04:41:35.830 --> 04:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
adjustments we uh modified
 
04:41:38.708 --> 04:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
that uh participation percentage to
 
04:41:40.708 --> 04:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
align with
 
04:41:43.110 --> 04:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
the state line split that we typically
 
04:41:48.310 --> 04:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:51.110 --> 04:41:51.120 align:start position:0%

04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that was a nine million dollar
 
04:41:56.628 --> 04:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
increase overall uh from a funding
 
04:42:00.788 --> 04:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:03.030 --> 04:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
overall the scope and cost adjustments
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
and in the previous slides are about 121
 
04:42:07.990 --> 04:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars and that's summarized
 
04:42:13.030 --> 04:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:15.670 --> 04:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
slide 17
 
04:42:19.350 --> 04:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
this identifies uh the the increase in
 
04:42:21.510 --> 04:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
funds that we were utilizing here
 
04:42:21.520 --> 04:42:22.470 align:start position:0%
funds that we were utilizing here
between

04:42:22.470 --> 04:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%

slide 18
 
04:43:14.788 --> 04:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
there were also some new projects added

as part of the gasset
 
04:43:20.788 --> 04:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
process and this identifies the list of

new projects that were added
 
04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
i'll note

improvements
 
04:43:38.150 --> 04:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
overall this was a project that
 
04:43:39.750 --> 04:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
had was a
 
04:43:42.470 --> 04:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
locally managed project that
 
04:43:42.480 --> 04:43:43.750 align:start position:0%
locally managed project that
was

04:43:43.750 --> 04:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:43:46.948 --> 04:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
bid out and was never uh awarded
 
04:43:51.270 --> 04:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
um and so uh that we received some um
 
04:43:54.150 --> 04:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
commentary and input from from uh
 
04:43:56.070 --> 04:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
from hooksett at one of the hearings and
 
04:43:58.830 --> 04:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
this was one of the projects that was
 
04:44:02.550 --> 04:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh entered back into the in into the
 
04:44:02.560 --> 04:44:06.948 align:start position:0%
uh entered back into the in into the
plan

04:44:06.948 --> 04:44:06.958 align:start position:0%

slide 19
 
04:44:10.948 --> 04:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
accelerated municipal bridges so this is
 
04:44:14.788 --> 04:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
a this is a list of 29 municipal bridge
 
04:44:14.798 --> 04:44:16.310 align:start position:0%
a this is a list of 29 municipal bridge
projects

04:44:16.310 --> 04:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
projects
 
04:44:17.350 --> 04:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
that were
 
04:44:21.070 --> 04:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
funded in the current 10-year plan
 
04:44:26.230 --> 04:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
21-30 plan using state bridge aid funds
 
04:44:29.910 --> 04:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
and as part of that 15 percent uh of the
 
04:44:32.070 --> 04:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh the new bridge funds that were
 
04:44:34.788 --> 04:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
um brought into the plan we were able to
 
04:44:37.430 --> 04:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
accelerate a num all of these bridges
 
04:44:39.030 --> 04:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
here so the 29 of them that we
 
04:44:43.030 --> 04:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
accelerated by a way of utilizing this
 
04:44:45.510 --> 04:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
additional funding um that was approved
 
04:44:47.830 --> 04:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
within the iija
 
04:44:50.628 --> 04:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
again there's the whole list here but it
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
some of them were advanced one year some

years but
 
04:44:59.430 --> 04:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
basically we we tried to accelerate as
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
many as we could
 
04:45:00.958 --> 04:45:02.390 align:start position:0%
many as we could
um

04:45:02.390 --> 04:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:05.430 --> 04:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
with the funds that were available
 
04:45:07.430 --> 04:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
for only those bridges that were already
 
04:45:09.750 --> 04:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
included in the plan so we plan to do a
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
new solicitation
 
04:45:13.910 --> 04:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh for the balance of funding both in
 
04:45:16.150 --> 04:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
the in the state aid bridge program and
 
04:45:16.160 --> 04:45:17.190 align:start position:0%
the in the state aid bridge program and
also

04:45:17.190 --> 04:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:45:18.708 --> 04:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
if there's any additional funds
 
04:45:18.718 --> 04:45:19.830 align:start position:0%
if there's any additional funds
available

04:45:19.830 --> 04:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:45:21.910 --> 04:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
through the federal funding of this
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
program we will do a new solicitation
 
04:45:25.990 --> 04:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
and bring those in in the next update of
 
04:45:31.830 --> 04:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:34.150 --> 04:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
moving on to slide 20.
 
04:45:34.160 --> 04:45:35.670 align:start position:0%

04:45:45.350 --> 04:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
in the summer
 
04:45:47.350 --> 04:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to make sure that we had
 
04:45:49.910 --> 04:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
identified these projects in in and
 
04:45:51.910 --> 04:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately at this point in time where
 
04:45:53.350 --> 04:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
they stand
 
04:45:55.510 --> 04:45:55.520 align:start position:0%

and we plan to fund that with uh

and the funding was um uh

ah thank you thank you for the
 
04:48:13.590 --> 04:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
presentation and the update on how
 
04:48:15.510 --> 04:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
things change from the time some of us
 
04:48:17.670 --> 04:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
went to the gasset hearings to
 
04:48:19.430 --> 04:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
what is in front of us
 
04:48:23.030 --> 04:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
and where the the federal money went um
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative query you remember your
 
04:48:25.200 --> 04:48:27.590 align:start position:0%
representative query you remember your
question

04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:48:31.110 --> 04:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
i uh luckily wrote it down um
 
04:48:31.120 --> 04:48:31.990 align:start position:0%
i uh luckily wrote it down um
uh

04:48:31.990 --> 04:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:48:33.990 --> 04:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to go back to
 
04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh page 12. um
 
04:48:38.830 --> 04:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
and just wanted to get a quick
 
04:48:40.868 --> 04:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
clarification on
 
04:48:42.070 --> 04:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
it what
 
04:48:44.948 --> 04:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
uh your definition of expand travel
 
04:48:48.070 --> 04:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
option is and what the uh
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
the audience of the survey
 
04:48:53.190 --> 04:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
was like like what was their prompt
 
04:48:56.070 --> 04:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
in answering expanded travel options i
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:03.360 --> 04:49:05.110 align:start position:0%
 
first

04:49:05.110 --> 04:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:49:05.120 --> 04:49:06.470 align:start position:0%
first
so

04:49:06.470 --> 04:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:10.150 --> 04:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
many times um there are comments that we
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
receive that um call this a highway plan
 
04:49:16.470 --> 04:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
and this is a transportation plan
 
04:49:20.868 --> 04:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
and it includes uh many uh modes of of
 
04:49:23.110 --> 04:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
of travel
 
04:49:25.590 --> 04:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
so more than just highway and bridge it
 
04:49:30.470 --> 04:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:34.150 --> 04:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
so expanded travel options also
 
04:49:37.750 --> 04:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
moves towards um
 
04:49:40.230 --> 04:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
investments in in paths and
 
04:49:42.310 --> 04:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
and sidewalks so people getting getting
 
04:49:44.070 --> 04:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
people out of cars
 
04:49:46.788 --> 04:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
and uh utilizing um
 
04:49:49.030 --> 04:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
pedestrian facilities and
 
04:49:50.788 --> 04:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
rail trails and those
 
04:49:53.030 --> 04:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
those types of uh
 
04:49:55.030 --> 04:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
travel options so we hear a lot of uh
 
04:49:58.230 --> 04:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
feedback and commentary um
 
04:50:01.750 --> 04:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
on expanded travel options and we
 
04:50:04.310 --> 04:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's why it's acknowledged here within
 
04:50:06.390 --> 04:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
the survey results and also within the
 
04:50:09.510 --> 04:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:12.070 --> 04:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
with respect to what was the prompt when
 
04:50:13.590 --> 04:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
they were completing the survey we
 
04:50:15.430 --> 04:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
actually had a question where you could
 
04:50:15.440 --> 04:50:17.190 align:start position:0%
actually had a question where you could
take

04:50:17.190 --> 04:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
take
 
04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
these five elements
 
04:50:21.030 --> 04:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
expanding travel options maintain the
 
04:50:21.040 --> 04:50:22.150 align:start position:0%
expanding travel options maintain the
system

04:50:22.150 --> 04:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:50:23.510 --> 04:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
as well as a couple of other ones and
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
rank them in importance and so we heard
 
04:50:27.990 --> 04:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
04:50:30.230 --> 04:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
feedback that expanding travel options
 
04:50:35.110 --> 04:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:35.120 --> 04:50:36.708 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

04:50:36.708 --> 04:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:50:39.510 --> 04:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
and just to follow up on that so is the
 
04:50:42.470 --> 04:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
are the charts just um
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
their number one option or is it kind of
 
04:50:44.400 --> 04:50:45.110 align:start position:0%
their number one option or is it kind of
like

04:50:45.110 --> 04:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
every like each one was valued at a
 
04:50:50.230 --> 04:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
point or something
 
04:50:52.070 --> 04:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
if it's helpful we could provide the
 
04:50:53.910 --> 04:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
committee with the responses to all of
 
04:50:56.070 --> 04:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
the survey questions and you'll see
 
04:50:58.550 --> 04:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
how we
 
04:51:00.390 --> 04:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
then use that information to inform the
 
04:51:02.230 --> 04:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
decision making what we're showing this
 
04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
slide is just one question there was a
 
04:51:08.550 --> 04:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:11.190 --> 04:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative jack
 
04:51:13.030 --> 04:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:51:15.750 --> 04:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
coming uh i i'm gonna have two questions
 
04:51:18.470 --> 04:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh early on before you said something
 
04:51:20.550 --> 04:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
about redless bridges and six to seven
 
04:51:22.628 --> 04:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
years and what i got from it was you
 
04:51:24.150 --> 04:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to wipe out
 
04:51:26.230 --> 04:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
the redless bridges did i did i
 
04:51:30.390 --> 04:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.070 --> 04:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
all um
 
04:51:32.080 --> 04:51:33.430 align:start position:0%
all um
so

04:51:33.430 --> 04:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:35.270 --> 04:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
all of the redless bridges that we are
 
04:51:39.190 --> 04:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
aware of are um they're they're included
 
04:51:42.070 --> 04:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
within this 10-year plan say for five
 
04:51:43.910 --> 04:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
this i believe there's five that are not
 
04:51:47.350 --> 04:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
included in this plan and generally
 
04:51:48.788 --> 04:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
we are adding
 
04:51:52.470 --> 04:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
um new projects new bridges to the plan
 
04:51:54.230 --> 04:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
every two years through this update
 
04:51:54.240 --> 04:51:55.270 align:start position:0%
every two years through this update
process

04:51:55.270 --> 04:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:51:58.628 --> 04:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
in the latter two years of the plan
 
04:51:58.638 --> 04:51:59.590 align:start position:0%
in the latter two years of the plan
and

04:51:59.590 --> 04:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:52:01.590 --> 04:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
as part of this additional funding that
 
04:52:05.350 --> 04:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
we received we included
 
04:52:05.360 --> 04:52:06.390 align:start position:0%
we received we included
funding

04:52:06.390 --> 04:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:52:08.948 --> 04:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
to a red less bridge program
 
04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
um in the outer years of the plan
 
04:52:15.430 --> 04:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
to a tune of about 120 million or so
 
04:52:18.948 --> 04:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
and what that will allow us to do is to
 
04:52:21.190 --> 04:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
when new bridges do come on
 
04:52:22.628 --> 04:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
that they will be
 
04:52:25.350 --> 04:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
we can we we have room in the plan
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
earlier than later in order to
 
04:52:31.510 --> 04:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
accelerate their removal so we
 
04:52:35.430 --> 04:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
i think we're estimating that each year
 
04:52:37.910 --> 04:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
um we'll have somewhere between 12 and
 
04:52:41.910 --> 04:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
14 um bridges come on to the red list
 
04:52:43.830 --> 04:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
so presumably every two years we're
 
04:52:46.550 --> 04:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
going to have another two dozen or so
 
04:52:48.070 --> 04:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
that we're going to need to include in
 
04:52:51.030 --> 04:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
the plan and what this my comment was
 
04:52:54.150 --> 04:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
that we would try to remove those sooner
 
04:52:56.788 --> 04:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
than later if we can adequately fund it
 
04:52:59.830 --> 04:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
um and that the bridges won't stay on
 
04:53:02.150 --> 04:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
the red list for as long as they had
 
04:53:04.868 --> 04:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
been uh previously
 
04:53:06.390 --> 04:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
great and if you would indulge me for a
 
04:53:07.670 --> 04:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
second question
 
04:53:10.390 --> 04:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:12.390 --> 04:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
the 60 million that you haven't
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
allocated yet
 
04:53:15.270 --> 04:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh that you say you don't have enough
 
04:53:15.280 --> 04:53:16.948 align:start position:0%
uh that you say you don't have enough
information

04:53:16.948 --> 04:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:53:18.550 --> 04:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
is the timing on that that you're going
 
04:53:21.110 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
to get it done before the senate while
 
04:53:23.030 --> 04:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
the senate has possession of it because
 
04:53:25.030 --> 04:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
once we pass the 10-year plan you can't
 
04:53:27.990 --> 04:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
add anything as i understand it
 
04:53:30.948 --> 04:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
so it's still unclear when
 
04:53:32.868 --> 04:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
usdot will make available the
 
04:53:34.470 --> 04:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
apportionment tables
 
04:53:37.030 --> 04:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
so for example on the public transit
 
04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
side when we met last time we walked you
 
04:53:41.350 --> 04:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
through the different types of
 
04:53:43.110 --> 04:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
funding available whether it's money for
 
04:53:45.910 --> 04:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
urban systems or for rural systems what
 
04:53:47.590 --> 04:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for is the exact amount
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
each of those categories
 
04:53:51.110 --> 04:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
and then we'll make the adjustments so
 
04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
that might be during this phase or it
 
04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
might be a couple of months out and be
 
04:53:55.830 --> 04:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
during the senate phase
 
04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
with the airports it's a little bit more
 
04:54:00.470 --> 04:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
challenging because
 
04:54:01.990 --> 04:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
aeronautics is not funded through
 
04:54:03.750 --> 04:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
surface transportation so we know this
 
04:54:05.590 --> 04:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
additional money is coming but i think
 
04:54:06.868 --> 04:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
it will take a little bit longer for us
 
04:54:08.868 --> 04:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
to get the information on what types of
 
04:54:08.878 --> 04:54:10.150 align:start position:0%
to get the information on what types of
projects

04:54:10.150 --> 04:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
projects
 
04:54:12.150 --> 04:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
will be eligible and exactly how much
 
04:54:17.830 --> 04:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
for the question further questions from
 
04:54:21.350 --> 04:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:54:21.360 --> 04:54:22.070 align:start position:0%
the committee
uh

04:54:22.070 --> 04:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:54:26.070 --> 04:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:28.310 --> 04:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:54:31.350 --> 04:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
being here i just i don't know how much
 
04:54:31.360 --> 04:54:32.390 align:start position:0%
being here i just i don't know how much
detail

04:54:32.390 --> 04:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
detail
 
04:54:34.948 --> 04:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
you have available at this point but i'm
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
wondering what what really is an ev
 
04:54:40.628 --> 04:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
program you develop the
 
04:54:42.550 --> 04:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
idea of where you're going to put them
 
04:54:44.230 --> 04:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
do you are you thinking about putting
 
04:54:46.708 --> 04:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
them on state loan land do you have to
 
04:54:50.788 --> 04:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
release land how much is a station
 
04:54:51.830 --> 04:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
i mean i
 
04:54:54.070 --> 04:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking a lot about building out
 
04:54:57.590 --> 04:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
our ev infrastructure and any detail i'd
 
04:54:57.600 --> 04:54:58.708 align:start position:0%
our ev infrastructure and any detail i'd
appreciate

04:54:58.708 --> 04:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:55:01.110 --> 04:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
so the eevee
 
04:55:03.510 --> 04:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
charging program is a new category of
 
04:55:03.520 --> 04:55:04.550 align:start position:0%
charging program is a new category of
funding

04:55:04.550 --> 04:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:55:07.270 --> 04:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
there's actually two opportunities and
 
04:55:08.948 --> 04:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
what we have included in the 10-year
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
plan is the funds that were received by
 
04:55:10.798 --> 04:55:11.910 align:start position:0%
plan is the funds that were received by
formula

04:55:11.910 --> 04:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
formula
 
04:55:13.590 --> 04:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
there's also going to be a discretionary
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
grant program so new hampshire could
 
04:55:15.600 --> 04:55:16.708 align:start position:0%
grant program so new hampshire could
apply

04:55:16.708 --> 04:55:16.718 align:start position:0%
apply
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
and compete to secure additional dollars
 
04:55:21.110 --> 04:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
beyond the 17 million that we've
 
04:55:21.120 --> 04:55:22.390 align:start position:0%
beyond the 17 million that we've
included

04:55:22.390 --> 04:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
included
 
04:55:24.390 --> 04:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan
 
04:55:26.470 --> 04:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
at this point what we know is that we do
 
04:55:28.788 --> 04:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
need to develop a plan on where we would
 
04:55:31.990 --> 04:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
install these electric charging units
 
04:55:33.590 --> 04:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
before we'll be able to access those
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds and we are waiting for
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
more guidance from usdot on how they're
 
04:55:39.590 --> 04:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
going to administer that particular
 
04:55:39.600 --> 04:55:40.550 align:start position:0%
going to administer that particular
program

04:55:40.550 --> 04:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:55:42.070 --> 04:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
and what the rules will be around
 
04:55:44.470 --> 04:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
accessing those federal funds but we do
 
04:55:46.070 --> 04:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
know that an element of that is
 
04:55:48.788 --> 04:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
developed developing a plan to show
 
04:55:50.948 --> 04:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
where we intend to install the units and
 
04:55:52.470 --> 04:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
how we have
 
04:55:53.830 --> 04:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
determined where they're most
 
04:55:55.910 --> 04:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately cited
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
and we'll be working very closely
 
04:55:59.350 --> 04:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
when it comes to ev charging
 
04:56:00.470 --> 04:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure you know we've been
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
working with our colleagues at the
 
04:56:03.990 --> 04:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
and talking with the utility companies
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
about the role that they'll play and so
 
04:56:10.868 --> 04:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
while the funds are flowing through
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
usdot to the department of
 
04:56:12.480 --> 04:56:13.910 align:start position:0%
usdot to the department of
transportation

04:56:13.910 --> 04:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
04:56:15.750 --> 04:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
we'll be of course partnering with the
 
04:56:18.070 --> 04:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
other state agencies who
 
04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
play a significant role when it comes to
 
04:56:25.830 --> 04:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:28.868 --> 04:56:28.878 align:start position:0%
so how long will it take to develop your
 
04:56:28.878 --> 04:56:30.230 align:start position:0%
so how long will it take to develop your
plan

04:56:30.230 --> 04:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:56:32.708 --> 04:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
it depends on when federal highway
 
04:56:34.788 --> 04:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
releases the guidance because we want to
 
04:56:37.510 --> 04:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that our plan is in compliance
 
04:56:37.520 --> 04:56:38.390 align:start position:0%
make sure that our plan is in compliance
so

04:56:38.390 --> 04:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:56:38.400 --> 04:56:39.590 align:start position:0%
so
we're

04:56:39.590 --> 04:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:56:41.830 --> 04:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
working very closely with usdot and with
 
04:56:43.590 --> 04:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
federal highway specifically to
 
04:56:45.910 --> 04:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
understand when the guidance documents
 
04:56:47.190 --> 04:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
will be available
 
04:56:48.628 --> 04:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
but you have to appreciate you know the
 
04:56:50.788 --> 04:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
bill was only passed at the end of last
 
04:56:52.868 --> 04:56:52.878 align:start position:0%
year there's a number of discretionary
 
04:56:55.510 --> 04:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
programs as well as these new formula
 
04:56:57.990 --> 04:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
programs so it will take some time for
 
04:56:59.590 --> 04:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
all of the guidance documents to be
 
04:57:03.430 --> 04:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:03.440 --> 04:57:04.788 align:start position:0%
 
i'm

04:57:04.788 --> 04:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
04:57:06.868 --> 04:57:06.878 align:start position:0%
following on on that one so when you say
 
04:57:08.708 --> 04:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
it's included in the 10-year plan i'm
 
04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
not going to find anything in this book
 
04:57:14.788 --> 04:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
that says ev charging or am i
 
04:57:14.798 --> 04:57:18.070 align:start position:0%
that says ev charging or am i
where

04:57:18.080 --> 04:57:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
programs

04:57:19.430 --> 04:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
um it'll cev program
 
04:57:23.830 --> 04:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you what page
 
04:57:26.150 --> 04:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh later at some point you're gonna have
 
04:57:28.708 --> 04:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
to point that out to at least me
 
04:57:30.628 --> 04:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
representative thompson has a question i
 
04:57:33.910 --> 04:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
believe i do
 
04:57:35.670 --> 04:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming commissioner and
 
04:57:35.680 --> 04:57:37.430 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming commissioner and
director

04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
director
 
04:57:39.830 --> 04:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
we had some discussion earlier today on
 
04:57:41.750 --> 04:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
a bill that
 
04:57:43.750 --> 04:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
was concerned with the hackett hill road
 
04:57:45.670 --> 04:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
3a intersection
 
04:57:48.550 --> 04:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
and i see that you've got that in your
 
04:57:50.628 --> 04:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
new projects i wonder if you could
 
04:57:53.190 --> 04:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit
 
04:58:02.708 --> 04:58:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:06.150 --> 04:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
so um the initial
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
scope of
 
04:58:09.990 --> 04:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
work for the
 
04:58:13.190 --> 04:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
municipally managed project was to
 
04:58:13.200 --> 04:58:14.948 align:start position:0%
municipally managed project was to
um

04:58:14.948 --> 04:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:18.470 --> 04:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
when they actually designed a roundabout
 
04:58:21.430 --> 04:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
at 3a and hackett hill road
 
04:58:23.910 --> 04:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
again it was designed it was advertised
 
04:58:27.270 --> 04:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
for construction bids were received and
 
04:58:29.510 --> 04:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
the town did not award because of the
 
04:58:29.520 --> 04:58:31.270 align:start position:0%
the town did not award because of the
price

04:58:31.270 --> 04:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
price
 
04:58:31.280 --> 04:58:32.470 align:start position:0%
price
increase

04:58:32.470 --> 04:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:58:34.788 --> 04:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
um we think it's a
 
04:58:34.798 --> 04:58:36.150 align:start position:0%
um we think it's a
this

04:58:36.150 --> 04:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:58:38.230 --> 04:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
you know the the
 
04:58:40.550 --> 04:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
some of the issues
 
04:58:45.190 --> 04:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
along 3a within that immediate area
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
we find this value in this project
 
04:58:50.070 --> 04:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
and so this project would expand the
 
04:58:53.910 --> 04:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
footprint a bit and also take a look at
 
04:58:53.920 --> 04:58:55.510 align:start position:0%
footprint a bit and also take a look at
the

04:58:55.510 --> 04:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:58:59.270 --> 04:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
signalized intersection to the north
 
04:59:03.350 --> 04:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
of hackett hill road and we'd look to
 
04:59:05.990 --> 04:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
engineer a solution
 
04:59:07.670 --> 04:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
that would encompass both of those
 
04:59:09.910 --> 04:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
intersections and improve overall
 
04:59:14.788 --> 04:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:16.310 --> 04:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:59:29.430 --> 04:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:31.030 --> 04:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
all right okay all right thank you
 
04:59:32.788 --> 04:59:32.798 align:start position:0%
representative jack a question and i'd
 
04:59:35.350 --> 04:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
like to on page seven of the slide
 
04:59:37.270 --> 04:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
presentation funding to scope
 
04:59:40.070 --> 04:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
constrained projects and specifically
 
04:59:42.390 --> 04:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
dopt projects i'm looking at the project
 
04:59:45.030 --> 04:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
in charleston along route 12 which
 
04:59:48.070 --> 04:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
project number five four zero six six
 
04:59:48.080 --> 04:59:48.948 align:start position:0%
project number five four zero six six
seven

04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
seven
 
04:59:50.830 --> 04:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
road restoration and
 
04:59:52.948 --> 04:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation and i noticed you had it
 
04:59:55.190 --> 04:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
listed for just over 14 million an
 
04:59:57.670 --> 04:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
additional 5 million is any of that
 
04:59:57.680 --> 04:59:58.550 align:start position:0%
additional 5 million is any of that
money

04:59:58.550 --> 04:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:00:01.430 --> 05:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
because of a situation in that area now
 
05:00:03.830 --> 05:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
that root part of route 12 was damaged
 
05:00:05.430 --> 05:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
because of flooding
 
05:00:07.270 --> 05:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
and i guess there was a contract awarded
 
05:00:09.670 --> 05:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
by the governor and council
 
05:00:12.550 --> 05:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
on that issue and i know by the way your
 
05:00:14.868 --> 05:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
kathleen mulcay hampson has been keeping
 
05:00:17.270 --> 05:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
us reps from our area informed i asked
 
05:00:19.190 --> 05:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
her us to keep this committee brief does
 
05:00:21.350 --> 05:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
any of that related to that fixing that
 
05:00:22.948 --> 05:00:22.958 align:start position:0%
issue which is
 
05:00:25.670 --> 05:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to be fixed by end of april
 
05:00:27.030 --> 05:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh no sir
 
05:00:31.270 --> 05:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
we just reviewed overall scope and and
 
05:00:33.590 --> 05:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
sized it appropriately to fit the
 
05:00:35.190 --> 05:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
footprint of the project so there was
 
05:00:37.510 --> 05:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
additional funds that were necessary
 
05:00:39.270 --> 05:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
okay so that has nothing to do with what
 
05:00:41.430 --> 05:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
is going to fix that there are two
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
separate projects one is to repair the
 
05:00:45.270 --> 05:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
damage and make sure that the road is
 
05:00:48.070 --> 05:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
passable again and then this is a
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
project that was already moving forward
 
05:00:51.670 --> 05:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
before the storm
 
05:00:51.680 --> 05:00:52.550 align:start position:0%
before the storm
hit

05:00:52.550 --> 05:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
hit
 
05:01:00.948 --> 05:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:03.270 --> 05:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
all right okay thank you so so it's
 
05:01:05.190 --> 05:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
basically all this money is for the
 
05:01:09.030 --> 05:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
long-term restoration of route 12.
 
05:01:10.948 --> 05:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
correct all right okay thank you thank
 
05:01:12.708 --> 05:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
05:01:14.948 --> 05:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
other questions i would remind the
 
05:01:17.270 --> 05:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
committee that we have two full days or
 
05:01:20.310 --> 05:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
at least a day if we don't need two full
 
05:01:20.320 --> 05:01:21.270 align:start position:0%
at least a day if we don't need two full
days

05:01:21.270 --> 05:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
days
 
05:01:23.430 --> 05:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
of of work session
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
dealing with the entire program and the
 
05:01:29.190 --> 05:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
department will be here for those
 
05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
those meetings so as you go through not
 
05:01:35.350 --> 05:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
just the slides but looking at the book
 
05:01:38.310 --> 05:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
over the next week um
 
05:01:38.320 --> 05:01:39.350 align:start position:0%
over the next week um
let's

05:01:39.350 --> 05:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
let's
 
05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
look at that and and then ask the
 
05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
specific question i'm not going to show
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
anybody off right now
 
05:01:45.910 --> 05:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
but um
 
05:01:47.750 --> 05:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes
 
05:01:49.590 --> 05:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's better if you look and figure out
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
what was in the last one what's in this
 
05:01:53.590 --> 05:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
one oh if you want copies the last one i
 
05:01:57.590 --> 05:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
have a box of them on my desk
 
05:01:57.600 --> 05:01:58.390 align:start position:0%
have a box of them on my desk
which

05:01:58.390 --> 05:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:02:01.270 --> 05:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
because the covert never got handed out
 
05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:09.030 --> 05:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:10.788 --> 05:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:02:13.350 --> 05:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for taking my question
 
05:02:15.830 --> 05:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh it has to do on page 20.
 
05:02:19.190 --> 05:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh the portsmouth kittery the 15 7 31
 
05:02:20.948 --> 05:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
port authority uh
 
05:02:22.708 --> 05:02:22.718 align:start position:0%
the functional replacement
 
05:02:24.948 --> 05:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
you know because of the bridge work that
 
05:02:27.270 --> 05:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
was done nearby and they had to you know
 
05:02:29.830 --> 05:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
actually fix some of the area that
 
05:02:32.150 --> 05:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
where it was
 
05:02:35.190 --> 05:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
is the full 32 million for construction
 
05:02:41.030 --> 05:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:43.510 --> 05:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
um so originally we had hoped to secure
 
05:02:46.230 --> 05:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
a discretionary grant to supplement what
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
was budgeted in the last 10-year plan
 
05:02:50.390 --> 05:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
for this particular project
 
05:02:52.150 --> 05:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we were unsuccessful in
 
05:02:54.550 --> 05:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
securing that grant because of the
 
05:02:57.350 --> 05:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
passage of the iija we have more money
 
05:02:59.430 --> 05:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
in this federal fiscal year
 
05:03:02.470 --> 05:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
um so there's more funding in 2022
 
05:03:04.550 --> 05:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
and then in the window of the draft
 
05:03:06.708 --> 05:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
10-year plan that you're looking 23
 
05:03:06.718 --> 05:03:07.910 align:start position:0%
10-year plan that you're looking 23
forward

05:03:07.910 --> 05:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:03:10.230 --> 05:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
so at this time we would anticipate
 
05:03:12.550 --> 05:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
using the additional
 
05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
apportionment that we're receiving for
 
05:03:16.310 --> 05:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 and advancing that
 
05:03:16.320 --> 05:03:17.670 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 and advancing that
project

05:03:17.670 --> 05:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:03:19.750 --> 05:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
before september
 
05:03:21.590 --> 05:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
30th of this year
 
05:03:23.190 --> 05:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
we're still
 
05:03:24.628 --> 05:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
looking at other options that might be
 
05:03:27.190 --> 05:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
available to us but that's the current
 
05:03:27.200 --> 05:03:30.070 align:start position:0%
available to us but that's the current
recommendation

05:03:30.070 --> 05:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:03:34.070 --> 05:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative ebel
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
i wanted to inform the chair that the
 
05:03:39.270 --> 05:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle infrastructure program
 
05:03:41.990 --> 05:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
is on page 204
 
05:03:52.230 --> 05:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:55.270 --> 05:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh the the roll out so could you just
 
05:03:57.190 --> 05:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
remind but i have another question on
 
05:03:59.350 --> 05:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
page nine where it says active
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
transportation can you remind me again
 
05:04:04.470 --> 05:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
what that means i think you described it
 
05:04:07.030 --> 05:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
but i don't quite
 
05:04:08.390 --> 05:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
before i answer that question i just
 
05:04:10.150 --> 05:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
want to circle back to the ev charging
 
05:04:10.160 --> 05:04:11.190 align:start position:0%
want to circle back to the ev charging
program

05:04:11.190 --> 05:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:04:13.910 --> 05:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
so our formula funds the core highway
 
05:04:16.150 --> 05:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
programs we have to obligate those
 
05:04:18.788 --> 05:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
dollars every year one thing we should
 
05:04:20.868 --> 05:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
point out about the new bridge program
 
05:04:23.510 --> 05:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
the 225 million as well as the ev
 
05:04:25.990 --> 05:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
charging is we get the money for a
 
05:04:28.070 --> 05:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
five-year period so it's not the same
 
05:04:30.310 --> 05:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
urgency to obligate
 
05:04:32.310 --> 05:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
a certain amount each and every year we
 
05:04:34.470 --> 05:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
can roll it forward and spend it at a
 
05:04:36.390 --> 05:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
future date so that's why
 
05:04:38.310 --> 05:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
we expect federal highway to focus on
 
05:04:39.990 --> 05:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
guidance documents for the other
 
05:04:41.590 --> 05:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
programs where you have to obligate
 
05:04:44.868 --> 05:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
annually um the core formula programs
 
05:04:47.110 --> 05:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
and then perhaps issue the guidance on
 
05:04:49.590 --> 05:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
the ev charging piece so that there's
 
05:04:51.510 --> 05:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
less urgency
 
05:04:53.510 --> 05:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
we have really 17 million over five
 
05:04:55.750 --> 05:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
years as opposed to having to manage an
 
05:04:57.830 --> 05:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
annual apportionment so that takes the
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
pressure off a little bit
 
05:05:01.270 --> 05:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to active transportation
 
05:05:01.280 --> 05:05:02.150 align:start position:0%
with respect to active transportation
it's

05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:05:03.830 --> 05:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
what we consider healthy transportation
 
05:05:06.150 --> 05:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
options so walking and biking whether
 
05:05:08.230 --> 05:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's incorporating
 
05:05:10.470 --> 05:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
bike lanes and wider shoulders into our
 
05:05:12.948 --> 05:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
on-road connections or investing in rail
 
05:05:15.430 --> 05:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
trails and off system
 
05:05:15.440 --> 05:05:20.230 align:start position:0%
trails and off system
infrastructure

05:05:20.230 --> 05:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:23.270 --> 05:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
05:05:25.270 --> 05:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
if not i have a couple and they're all
 
05:05:26.788 --> 05:05:26.798 align:start position:0%
off of
 
05:05:29.190 --> 05:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
slide 20 of course
 
05:05:30.708 --> 05:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
because we are going to have to deal
 
05:05:33.190 --> 05:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
with some of these um first one the
 
05:05:34.868 --> 05:05:34.878 align:start position:0%
tilton project
 
05:05:37.750 --> 05:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
is that 3.25 million
 
05:05:40.788 --> 05:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
currently in your general fund budget to
 
05:05:43.430 --> 05:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
do that
 
05:05:45.190 --> 05:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
yes that project was funded through the
 
05:05:47.110 --> 05:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
budget process which is why we've
 
05:05:49.350 --> 05:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
included it as general funded
 
05:05:50.550 --> 05:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:50.560 --> 05:05:52.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:05:52.390 --> 05:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:52.400 --> 05:05:54.470 align:start position:0%
um
the

05:05:54.470 --> 05:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:05:57.750 --> 05:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
dixville colebrook the golf links road
 
05:06:00.550 --> 05:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
which is not included in the draft but
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
um i'm hearing a lot from various people
 
05:06:05.270 --> 05:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
about it needs to be funded
 
05:06:06.948 --> 05:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
if we
 
05:06:08.550 --> 05:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
give any money
 
05:06:10.628 --> 05:06:10.638 align:start position:0%
what type what color money would it have
 
05:06:12.948 --> 05:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
to be and are we looking at a private
 
05:06:16.070 --> 05:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
road or or a state road that we would
 
05:06:19.270 --> 05:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
have to maintain forever
 
05:06:22.550 --> 05:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
golflings road is currently state-owned
 
05:06:24.708 --> 05:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
and what had been proposed in previous
 
05:06:27.430 --> 05:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
10-year plans was that we would spend
 
05:06:29.910 --> 05:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
state dollars to improve the roadway and
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
then turn it over to the balsams
 
05:06:33.830 --> 05:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
because it really does serve that
 
05:06:33.840 --> 05:06:34.868 align:start position:0%
because it really does serve that
property

05:06:34.868 --> 05:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:06:36.708 --> 05:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
and isn't part of the the greater
 
05:06:39.270 --> 05:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
roadway network the challenge is this
 
05:06:40.948 --> 05:06:40.958 align:start position:0%
roadway is not eligible for federal
 
05:06:43.510 --> 05:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
funds it would have to be state funded
 
05:06:45.590 --> 05:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
and as we touched on
 
05:06:48.708 --> 05:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
during our last presentation
 
05:06:50.150 --> 05:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
while we've received a lot of additional
 
05:06:52.550 --> 05:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
federal funds through the iija our state
 
05:06:54.948 --> 05:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
revenues have been impacted by the covid
 
05:06:57.590 --> 05:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic and individuals just driving
 
05:06:57.600 --> 05:06:58.470 align:start position:0%
pandemic and individuals just driving
less

05:06:58.470 --> 05:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
less
 
05:06:58.480 --> 05:07:00.070 align:start position:0%
less
so

05:07:00.070 --> 05:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:07:01.830 --> 05:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
it would be a challenge to fund this
 
05:07:04.150 --> 05:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
project given the other
 
05:07:08.070 --> 05:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:09.910 --> 05:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay i
 
05:07:11.430 --> 05:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
thought that was the answer that was
 
05:07:12.550 --> 05:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
05:07:15.590 --> 05:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
state highway funds and if we do this we
 
05:07:17.110 --> 05:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
have to
 
05:07:19.590 --> 05:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
either not plow as often in the winter
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
or or dropped some other project
 
05:07:25.190 --> 05:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
something i'm i'm being semi-sarcastic
 
05:07:25.200 --> 05:07:26.070 align:start position:0%
something i'm i'm being semi-sarcastic
but

05:07:26.070 --> 05:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:07:28.550 --> 05:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
it really comes down to those kinds of
 
05:07:31.190 --> 05:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
choices if i'm right
 
05:07:33.110 --> 05:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
our highway funds are limited
 
05:07:34.948 --> 05:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
so yes those were the types of choices
 
05:07:37.110 --> 05:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to use highway funds
 
05:07:38.788 --> 05:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
you know although we would defer to the
 
05:07:40.390 --> 05:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
legislature you know general funds are
 
05:07:43.590 --> 05:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
being used for calif road so
 
05:07:45.190 --> 05:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
of course there's other funds that are
 
05:07:47.430 --> 05:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
not typically used by the dot that could
 
05:07:50.470 --> 05:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:53.990 --> 05:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
and the decision not to include the the
 
05:07:59.030 --> 05:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:00.868 --> 05:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
in the last 10-year plan the department
 
05:08:02.868 --> 05:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
had been given the authorization to work
 
05:08:04.788 --> 05:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
with the town of hudson
 
05:08:08.230 --> 05:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
um as they advanced the design of
 
05:08:09.590 --> 05:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
it would not be the circumferential
 
05:08:11.190 --> 05:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
highway it really would be
 
05:08:13.510 --> 05:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
a boulevard within the
 
05:08:16.550 --> 05:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
right-of-way that had been secured
 
05:08:18.868 --> 05:08:18.878 align:start position:0%
for the circumferential highway
 
05:08:20.470 --> 05:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
during this 10-year plan period we
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
didn't hear any advocacy from the town
 
05:08:25.270 --> 05:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
of hudson and since it was not a dot
 
05:08:27.350 --> 05:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
project it was a town-led project where
 
05:08:28.948 --> 05:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
we were just granted the authorization
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
to partner with them and to review their
 
05:08:32.868 --> 05:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
design et cetera
 
05:08:34.868 --> 05:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
it's not currently included in this 10
 
05:08:36.868 --> 05:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
year plan
 
05:08:38.310 --> 05:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:08:41.030 --> 05:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:08:42.868 --> 05:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
05:08:44.470 --> 05:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and we look forward
 
05:08:46.470 --> 05:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
to working with you over
 
05:08:48.948 --> 05:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh the next couple of weeks as we we
 
05:08:50.550 --> 05:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
discuss the
 
05:08:53.270 --> 05:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
the uh 10-year plan
 
05:08:55.510 --> 05:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
for the members we will be meeting next
 
05:08:58.868 --> 05:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
week we do have at least one more
 
05:09:00.310 --> 05:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
speaker today
 
05:09:03.270 --> 05:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
but as you go through the book and and
 
05:09:04.708 --> 05:09:04.718 align:start position:0%
these slides
 
05:09:07.110 --> 05:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
if you want to
 
05:09:09.350 --> 05:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
ask questions bring them in
 
05:09:11.750 --> 05:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can get them answered if you
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
think you're going to change something
 
05:09:16.150 --> 05:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
be willing to say what you're willing to
 
05:09:19.590 --> 05:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
give up someplace else to do them
 
05:09:21.910 --> 05:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's a zero-sum game as far as money
 
05:09:21.920 --> 05:09:23.590 align:start position:0%
it's a zero-sum game as far as money
goes

05:09:23.590 --> 05:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
goes
 
05:09:25.750 --> 05:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
so if you move something up be able to
 
05:09:28.628 --> 05:09:28.638 align:start position:0%
tell me and and the department what you
 
05:09:30.150 --> 05:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
want to move back
 
05:09:33.910 --> 05:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:35.830 --> 05:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want those arguments but but it
 
05:09:37.030 --> 05:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
really is
 
05:09:38.708 --> 05:09:38.718 align:start position:0%
i you know i kind of make fun of that
 
05:09:41.030 --> 05:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
but every year we have people come in
 
05:09:42.788 --> 05:09:42.798 align:start position:0%
and want to advance something or add
 
05:09:42.798 --> 05:09:44.150 align:start position:0%
and want to advance something or add
something

05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:09:44.160 --> 05:09:44.948 align:start position:0%
something
but

05:09:44.948 --> 05:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:09:46.708 --> 05:09:46.718 align:start position:0%
are not willing to
 
05:09:48.628 --> 05:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
say what they want to change what they
 
05:09:51.750 --> 05:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
want to drop in order to pay for it
 
05:09:53.670 --> 05:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
when i first came here
 
05:09:55.750 --> 05:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan was over a billion
 
05:09:57.910 --> 05:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
dollars over subscribed
 
05:10:01.990 --> 05:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
it took us years to get it down to
 
05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
fiscally constrained as much as possible
 
05:10:07.270 --> 05:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
and i as chairman and i thank all the
 
05:10:10.230 --> 05:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
veteran members want to keep it that way
 
05:10:11.830 --> 05:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
because if you put it on the 10-year
 
05:10:13.510 --> 05:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
plan somebody thinks it's actually going
 
05:10:15.030 --> 05:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
to get done
 
05:10:16.708 --> 05:10:16.718 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
05:10:19.750 --> 05:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
but if you're a billion dollars over
 
05:10:22.390 --> 05:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
you never know what's going to happen so
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
as you look through and i'm not trying
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
to say don't bring in amendments to
 
05:10:30.310 --> 05:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
change things or or whatever but it's up
 
05:10:33.350 --> 05:10:33.360 align:start position:0%

2023-2032 10-year plan
 
05:12:02.230 --> 05:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
as it has been
 
05:12:04.150 --> 05:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
presented by gasset and recommended to
 
05:12:05.590 --> 05:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
you by the governor
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan is a strong partnership
 
05:12:09.750 --> 05:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
between regional planning commissions
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the department of transportation we
 
05:12:13.830 --> 05:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
work closely together to ensure that
 
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
regional priorities are included in the
 
05:12:18.390 --> 05:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
plan given prevailing state and federal
 
05:12:21.030 --> 05:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
financial constraints and we in our
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
region are pleased with how the region's
 
05:12:25.030 --> 05:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
priorities are reflected in this draft
 
05:12:26.470 --> 05:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
05:12:28.230 --> 05:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
i just want to briefly hit a couple of
 
05:12:29.910 --> 05:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
highlights in our region that are of
 
05:12:32.470 --> 05:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
note uh in this 10-year plan i won't get
 
05:12:33.990 --> 05:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
too far into the minutia and i'll keep
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
it uh short
 
05:12:37.990 --> 05:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh but i i do want to start with a an
 
05:12:40.628 --> 05:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement uh of of all of the
 
05:12:44.070 --> 05:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
effort that has happened over many years
 
05:12:45.590 --> 05:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
between new hampshire department of
 
05:12:47.750 --> 05:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
transportation with the support of the
 
05:12:49.510 --> 05:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
legislature to
 
05:12:51.590 --> 05:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
construct and bring to completion the
 
05:12:53.670 --> 05:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
expansion of i-93 from salem to
 
05:12:53.680 --> 05:12:54.948 align:start position:0%
expansion of i-93 from salem to
manchester

05:12:54.948 --> 05:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
05:12:58.150 --> 05:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
that the completion of that project
 
05:13:00.948 --> 05:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
is a milestone not just for southern new
 
05:13:02.868 --> 05:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire but for the state as a whole
 
05:13:04.628 --> 05:13:04.638 align:start position:0%
we are appreciative in our region that
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
that project is is a 10-year plan
 
05:13:09.430 --> 05:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
and that will require
 
05:13:12.230 --> 05:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
attention um obviously all debt service
 
05:13:12.240 --> 05:13:13.830 align:start position:0%
attention um obviously all debt service
does

05:13:13.830 --> 05:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:13:16.708 --> 05:13:16.718 align:start position:0%
so in this 10-year plan uh having said
 
05:13:16.718 --> 05:13:17.510 align:start position:0%

that one of the major projects on the
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
horizon in our region is exit 4a in
 
05:13:24.230 --> 05:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
derry and londonderry and this draft
 
05:13:26.390 --> 05:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
10-year plan does include full funding
 
05:13:28.470 --> 05:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
for the completion of the exit 4a
 
05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
project with construction scheduled to
 
05:13:30.480 --> 05:13:31.350 align:start position:0%
project with construction scheduled to
occur

05:13:31.350 --> 05:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
occur
 
05:13:34.628 --> 05:13:34.638 align:start position:0%
from 2023 to 2025. we thank the
 
05:13:36.310 --> 05:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
department of transportation and the

legislature for your continued support
 
05:13:39.670 --> 05:13:39.680 align:start position:0%

and we look forward to the mobility and
 
05:13:43.510 --> 05:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
economic development benefits the
 
05:13:45.430 --> 05:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
project will have for both dairy and
 
05:13:48.150 --> 05:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
londonderry and beyond
 
05:13:50.390 --> 05:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
for our regional planning commission the
 
05:13:51.350 --> 05:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
southern new hampshire planning
 
05:13:53.830 --> 05:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
commission uh we did not add any new
 
05:13:55.910 --> 05:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
projects in this 10-year plan update
 
05:13:58.230 --> 05:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
what we did with our regional allocation
 
05:13:59.990 --> 05:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
is we took a hard look
 
05:14:02.070 --> 05:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
in the existing 10-year plan and we
 
05:14:04.150 --> 05:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
identified two projects in our region
 
05:14:06.550 --> 05:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
that we knew to be underfunded and we
 
05:14:08.628 --> 05:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
committed our regional allocation to
 
05:14:11.190 --> 05:14:11.200 align:start position:0%
help bring those projects to uh to full
 
05:14:11.200 --> 05:14:12.310 align:start position:0%
help bring those projects to uh to full
funding

05:14:12.310 --> 05:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
funding
 
05:14:14.310 --> 05:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
those projects are the expansion of
 
05:14:16.708 --> 05:14:16.718 align:start position:0%
route three in bedford between hawthorne
 
05:14:18.948 --> 05:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
drive and raymond was oreck drive a very
 
05:14:20.628 --> 05:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
important project not only for the town
 
05:14:22.868 --> 05:14:22.878 align:start position:0%
of bedford but our region as a whole
 
05:14:24.628 --> 05:14:24.638 align:start position:0%
and the second project was in the town
 
05:14:26.628 --> 05:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
of londonderry the intersection
 
05:14:28.708 --> 05:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
improvements at new hampshire route 28
 
05:14:30.868 --> 05:14:30.878 align:start position:0%
and 128 if you're familiar with the town
 
05:14:33.110 --> 05:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
of londonderry in that intersection
 
05:14:34.708 --> 05:14:34.718 align:start position:0%
we focused our entire regional
 
05:14:37.510 --> 05:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
allocation on those two projects and and
 
05:14:39.430 --> 05:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
thankfully with the support of of new
 
05:14:41.750 --> 05:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire d.o.t i'm pleased to report
 
05:14:43.510 --> 05:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
that both of those projects are fully
 
05:14:46.310 --> 05:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
funded in this draft 10-year plan
 
05:14:49.670 --> 05:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
and so we are uh very thankful for that
 
05:14:52.310 --> 05:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh i i think in in uh in the remarks a
 
05:14:54.070 --> 05:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
few minutes ago from the commissioner
 
05:14:56.788 --> 05:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
and and pete stamnis i i want to echo
 
05:14:59.750 --> 05:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
um the that the covid pandemic has
 
05:15:01.510 --> 05:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
altered traffic patterns and has
 
05:15:03.990 --> 05:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
resulted in lower revenue projections
 
05:15:04.000 --> 05:15:04.868 align:start position:0%
resulted in lower revenue projections
for

05:15:04.868 --> 05:15:04.878 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:15:07.350 --> 05:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
a number of state revenue sources
 
05:15:09.670 --> 05:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps most notably the toll revenue
 
05:15:12.550 --> 05:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
projections for turnpike system revenues
 
05:15:12.560 --> 05:15:13.350 align:start position:0%
projections for turnpike system revenues
are

05:15:13.350 --> 05:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:15:15.350 --> 05:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
are lower because of the covid 19
 
05:15:15.360 --> 05:15:16.788 align:start position:0%
are lower because of the covid 19
pandemic

05:15:16.788 --> 05:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
05:15:19.590 --> 05:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the way that the dot has
 
05:15:22.470 --> 05:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
has navigated this period of of revenue
 
05:15:24.150 --> 05:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
uncertainty nobody could have predicted
 
05:15:25.990 --> 05:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
the pandemic when we were testifying on
 
05:15:28.230 --> 05:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
the last 10 year plan a couple of years
 
05:15:28.240 --> 05:15:29.110 align:start position:0%
the last 10 year plan a couple of years
ago

05:15:29.110 --> 05:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
ago
 
05:15:30.708 --> 05:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
in this very room
 
05:15:32.788 --> 05:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
and so we certainly thank the department
 
05:15:34.708 --> 05:15:34.718 align:start position:0%
for their efforts on that
 
05:15:37.190 --> 05:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
that said as a result of the lower toll
 
05:15:39.350 --> 05:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
revenue projections the 10-year plan
 
05:15:41.590 --> 05:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
does include timeline delays for a
 
05:15:44.230 --> 05:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
couple of very significant and important
 
05:15:46.708 --> 05:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
turnpike projects in our region
 
05:15:48.628 --> 05:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
most notably
 
05:15:51.270 --> 05:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
the reconstruction of exit six and seven
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
in the city of manchester
 
05:15:55.270 --> 05:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
as well as the expansion of the effie
 
05:15:56.948 --> 05:15:56.958 align:start position:0%
everett turnpike between nashua and
 
05:15:58.868 --> 05:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
bedford both of those projects seeing
 
05:16:01.030 --> 05:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
timeline delays as a result of those
 
05:16:03.430 --> 05:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
lower revenue projections
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot we can do about that
 
05:16:07.510 --> 05:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
at this point but that said both of
 
05:16:09.590 --> 05:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
these projects continue to enjoy strong
 
05:16:12.390 --> 05:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
local support within our region
 
05:16:14.070 --> 05:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
they have substantial safety and
 
05:16:16.470 --> 05:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
congestion benefits for our region and
 
05:16:18.070 --> 05:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
and we would ask that
 
05:16:20.628 --> 05:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
in the event that any new or unexpected
 
05:16:23.030 --> 05:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
revenue comes available and i say that
 
05:16:25.590 --> 05:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
often but in the last couple of years
 
05:16:27.110 --> 05:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
there has been new and unexpected
 
05:16:29.750 --> 05:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
revenue uh so in the event that any more
 
05:16:31.750 --> 05:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
of that comes to fruition we would
 
05:16:33.830 --> 05:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate consideration for those two
 
05:16:36.230 --> 05:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
projects on the turnpike system to help
 
05:16:37.990 --> 05:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
get those back to their their
 
05:16:41.030 --> 05:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic construction timelines
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
and additionally as
 
05:16:45.430 --> 05:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner mentioned there are a
 
05:16:47.110 --> 05:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
number of discretionary programs that
 
05:16:49.270 --> 05:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
have been established in the new
 
05:16:51.830 --> 05:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
iija the new infrastructure
 
05:16:53.350 --> 05:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
and jobs act
 
05:16:55.670 --> 05:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
if any of those discretionary programs
 
05:16:57.830 --> 05:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
may be an appropriate fit for one or
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
both of these projects we at the at the
 
05:17:00.788 --> 05:17:00.798 align:start position:0%
southern new hampshire planning
 
05:17:02.230 --> 05:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
commission would certainly be willing to
 
05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
assist in any way we can to develop a an
 
05:17:07.670 --> 05:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
application for for funding to help uh
 
05:17:09.670 --> 05:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
support the the construction of those
 
05:17:11.830 --> 05:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
projects through a discretionary program
 
05:17:14.150 --> 05:17:14.160 align:start position:0%

yeah thank you i just like to remind
 
05:18:38.788 --> 05:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
everyone the purpose of the microphones
 
05:18:40.708 --> 05:18:40.718 align:start position:0%
is not so people in the room can hear it
 
05:18:43.510 --> 05:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
so people on the live stream can hear
 
05:18:45.670 --> 05:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
so if the red light in front of you is
 
05:18:48.070 --> 05:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
not on the people watching cannot hear
 
05:18:48.080 --> 05:18:52.948 align:start position:0%
not on the people watching cannot hear
you

05:18:52.948 --> 05:18:52.958 align:start position:0%

05:18:58.948 --> 05:18:58.958 align:start position:0%
yeah just so for planning purposes how
 
05:19:00.390 --> 05:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
long do you expect
 
05:19:02.550 --> 05:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
us to go on the next two meetings i know
 
05:19:05.670 --> 05:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
we start at 9 30 but just time wise
 
05:19:08.070 --> 05:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
okay when you get the calendar this week
 
05:19:11.030 --> 05:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
you'll find that next week's
 
05:19:12.708 --> 05:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
on the 27th
 
05:19:15.190 --> 05:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
at 9 30 we will have the continued

on
 
05:19:21.110 --> 05:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
on the road usage and then hopefully
 
05:19:23.270 --> 05:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
that will be short
 
05:19:25.190 --> 05:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
and then start in on
 
05:19:28.390 --> 05:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
discussions of various projects whether
 
05:19:29.270 --> 05:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
or not
 
05:19:31.510 --> 05:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
we think that they should be where they
 
05:19:33.270 --> 05:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
are or whatever
 
05:19:35.350 --> 05:19:35.360 align:start position:0%

05:19:38.400 --> 05:19:39.510 align:start position:0%
amount of time time not later
and

05:19:39.510 --> 05:19:39.520 align:start position:0%

if we have some time i would like to
 
05:19:45.990 --> 05:19:46.000 align:start position:0%

for coming oh representative claudia
 
05:21:31.190 --> 05:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
now if you can answer this what bills do
 
05:21:33.190 --> 05:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
you anticipate as of today or have you
 
05:21:35.030 --> 05:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
made up your mind which you would like
 
05:21:37.510 --> 05:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
to exact next week you have any ideas i
 
05:21:39.990 --> 05:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
would like to exact all of them except
 
05:21:45.590 --> 05:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:47.270 --> 05:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
correct because
 
05:21:50.310 --> 05:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
you know if we get mired in in disputes
 
05:21:53.430 --> 05:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
on one or two of them um we can defer
 
05:21:55.910 --> 05:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
that but we can't defer them forever
 
05:21:58.310 --> 05:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
and and if we have to i
 
05:22:00.310 --> 05:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
don't really want to come in an extra
 
05:22:03.990 --> 05:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
