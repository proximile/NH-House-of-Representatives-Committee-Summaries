00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.469 align:start position:0%
i'm from temple
i

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
spent about 34 years of family law
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
lawyer and 22 years which continue as a
 
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
certified family mediator
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
you may remember some of you were around
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
in in 2018 when we had the alimony
 
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
working group and this was uh this is a
 
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
similar group somewhat overlapping in
 
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.150 align:start position:0%
similar group somewhat overlapping in
membership

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
membership
 
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
oh i forgot to mention i think the first
 
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
time i was privileged to testify before
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
this committee was 1987
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
when the you were considering
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh codifying the property of vision law
 
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
and it passed and i think has worked
 
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
the child support working group and i've
 
00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 align:start position:0%
my testimony has a description of the
 
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
group and lists the names of people at
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
the bottom three of us are here today
 
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
brought together our years of experience
 
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
i think i must have done
 
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
over a thousand cases over my years of
 
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
experience so and i represented dads i
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
represented moms
 
00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
in the early years i represented a lot
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
of dads
 
00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:24.550 align:start position:0%
of dads
in

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
primary parenting cases
 
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
because that was considered unusual in
 
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.749 align:start position:0%
because that was considered unusual in
82

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 align:start position:0%
82
 
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
and since i've been doing mediation i
 
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
have been a neutral between lots and
 
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
lots of parents
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
and try to get them to an agreement
 
00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:41.670 align:start position:0%
and try to get them to an agreement
and

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
what came out of our looking at what the
 
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
bills from last year is a need to focus
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
on one problem that
 
00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
perhaps could have an easy fix without a
 
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
big study but it needed some study and
 
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
that was what to do in the equal and
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
approximately equal cases
 
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
our goal was to clarify the law because
 
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
the law does spell out what to do
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
but it could be clearer
 
00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
please note that approximately what
 
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
be and all the other issues
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
and the 10 percent that don't have a
 
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
settlement not all the issues are about
 
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
child support some of those people
 
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
settled child support and are fighting
 
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
about the pension or the vacation home
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
or alimony although not so much in
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
recent years
 
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
when you hear about litigated cases
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
this is one person's experience
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
and i think you should weigh it
 
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.790 align:start position:0%
and i think you should weigh it
accordingly

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
we thought the first thing to do was to
 
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
what was important what was the criteria
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
we wanted to apply
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh in in finding a method and we
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's shown on page two of my
 
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.790 align:start position:0%
it's shown on page two of my
my

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
written testimony that we came up with
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
this test that was first thing fair to
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
the child
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
child support is about children
 
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's not about pay yours and payees
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
and the current statute says
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
the purpose of child support is to
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
minimize economic consequences to
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
children so we felt that that was
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
clearly the first priority
 
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
the next was a reasonable lifestyle for
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
the child in each home
 
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
right now that's in the law as
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
a test that says to meet the cost of
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
child rearing in a similar approximate
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
equal style to the other parent
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
so those two tests were those two
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
factors are in the current law and we
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
thought they were good ones
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
we thought it was important that it be
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
understandable even to self-represented
 
00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:50.150 align:start position:0%
understandable even to self-represented
parties

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
parties
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
and we thought it should distinguish
 
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
between those cases where guidelines
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
child support is appropriate
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
in light of fair to the child and
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable lifestyle and those that need
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
an adjustment and we felt it should
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
continue the long-standing requirement
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
so with those in mind we started uh
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
exploring what the options were to be
 
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
frank we we started early on looking at
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
the bill that representative desimone
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
put forward which would use net the
 
00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:24.230 align:start position:0%
put forward which would use net the
difference

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
in all equal time cases
 
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.189 align:start position:0%
in all equal time cases
um

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
i had used that test i'd used that
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
process for at least 20 years maybe
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
longer other members of our our group
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
had also used it inappropriate cases in
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
other words it was a settlement tool
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
it has a lot to be said for it it's
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
simple it's straightforward it's easy to
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
understand but when we got into it more
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
and tony matrimo who's here on our team
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
will explain how we got to the fact that
 
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
we concluded it wasn't fair to children
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
when the parents incomes were
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
substantially different
 
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.030 align:start position:0%
substantially different
so

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
um yes not the difference but but
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
limiting where it comes from i'd like to
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
just go over the bill and touch on some
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
high points
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
first we collected
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
all the
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
components that deal with
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
making adjustments to guidelines because
 
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
of equal or approximate equal into one
 
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
new section labeled
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
5a 458 c 5a you'll see it start on page
 
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
one section four line four so all the
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
material that has to do with this
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
concept is in one place it's not the way
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
the law is now this we thought would be
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
easier to follow
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
we start with equal or approximately
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
equal you might say what's that mean
 
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
well i can tell you
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean 51
 
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
to 60 it means equal or approximately
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
equal it's hard to give a number of
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
overnights which some would do because
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
that is not the whole test of equal or
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
approximately equal for instance there
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
a 40
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
60 overnight but there might be
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
every after school day afternoon with a
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
40 percent parent
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
so but because of work schedules the
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
overnights are not so closely split so
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
our view was
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
the courts seem to have been able to
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
recognize equal and approximately equal
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
it's been the law for some time and we
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
just stick with that
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
so we put in there
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
a new test
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
of for varying because of equal schedule
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
and meeting the costs of child rearing
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
in a similar approximate equal style you
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
recall that's similar to one of the
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
tests now
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
our tests eliminate any reference to
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
fixed cost because it seemed to be
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
less useful
 
00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.829 align:start position:0%
less useful
more

00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:00.550 align:start position:0%
more
problematic

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
in starting on line 14
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
section 3
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
there's an optional test
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
if the court thinks it is useful
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
in considering whether the style
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
lifestyle is similar they don't have to
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:21.430 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
then looking further down
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
line 24 this is the existing law that
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
when ruling on these requests for
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
deviation because of approximate equal
 
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.310 align:start position:0%
deviation because of approximate equal
schedule

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
they can look at whether the parties
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
have allocated expenses
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
what we added in there is on line 27
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
and they have provided a specific
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
procedure for implementing the
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
apportionment it is problematic when
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
people say we'll just split all expenses
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
or we'll just spit all you know
 
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.670 align:start position:0%
or we'll just spit all you know
extracurriculars

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
extracurriculars
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
and they don't have a method spelled out
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
so by
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
asking people to put in how they're
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
going to do it maybe they're going to
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
keep a joint account and need to put
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
money into it and use
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
debit cards to take money out of it to
 
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
pay for the extracurricular
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
maybe one parent is going to handle
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
expenses a b and c and the other
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
parent's going to ha and all expenses d
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
e and f
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
some plan for how it'll be doing because
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
we've seen that that can lead to our
 
00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:23.670 align:start position:0%
we've seen that that can lead to our
fights

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
fights
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
we've given a definition of variable
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
expenses just because there seemed to be
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
some confusion people didn't know what
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
variable expenses were or the difference
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
between variable and fixed so we just
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
we're trying to clarify the law by
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
looking at page two line three here's
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
something we added if the court is
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
making an adjustment because of equal
 
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.829 align:start position:0%
making an adjustment because of equal
schedule

00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
then the court needs to allocate the
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
cost of day care after school vacation
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
etc some
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
summer care unless the parties have done
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
so here's the problem
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
currently if you have guidelines the
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
person receiving the guidelines is
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
supposed to pay such expenses
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
but if it's not guidelines that
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
presumption may be inappropriate
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
and we're saying if you're going to
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
lessen the support then just say who's
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
going to pay which of these expenses
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
which is i'm sure you all know have only
 
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
increased in new hampshire
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
line six on page two starts out and
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
explains the net the difference so what
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
you do
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
you use the worksheet and i think you'll
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
be getting worksheets uh in a few
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
minutes from tony um
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
you take there's a point on the
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
worksheet where it says
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
when we look at the the parents
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
proportional incomes this is the portion
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
of the child support that is
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
attributable to one parent and then to
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
the other and it gives a percentage um
 
00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:56.310 align:start position:0%
the other and it gives a percentage um
so

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
you can look at the worksheet and you
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
can see right off whether
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's more 60 or more or it's less
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
so what we're saying is in cases where
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
the differences between the incomes is
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
such that one parent's
 
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.550 align:start position:0%
such that one parent's
income

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.350 align:start position:0%
income
is

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
less than 60 percent of the total that
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
was based on our experiment of doing
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
multiple uh scenarios and playing them
 
00:14:19.199 --> 00:14:20.069 align:start position:0%
multiple uh scenarios and playing them
out

00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
then you take the support that the form
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
gives you already the form gives us for
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
the high income parent
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
low-income parents subtract the lower
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
from the higher and that number is the
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
net the difference number and that's
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
what would be paid by the high-income
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
person this seems to work and come out
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
with fair results which tony will say
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
more about in these in this um income
 
00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:47.910 align:start position:0%
more about in these in this um income
situation

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.870 align:start position:0%
situation
um

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
so i think that's uh a review of the
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
bill i'm open to questions madam chair
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative yokela thank you thank
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
 
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.230 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
um

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
how did you decide
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
what um
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
well what criteria did you decide for
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
this uh working group a membership
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
and did you request uh or
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
do you uh reach out to the public um
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
because i don't see any um
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
families or
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
or judges um on this well judges would
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
not participate in such things they have
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
to stay apart from any more than they'd
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
be on a committee your your you would
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
set up um i spoke with the people who
 
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.670 align:start position:0%
set up um i spoke with the people who
had

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
been with the alimony group and looked
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
out for more people with a lot of
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
experience helping people settle these
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
cases and that's how
 
00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:49.110 align:start position:0%
cases and that's how
i

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
invited tony to come on it because he is
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
a professional mediator who spends every
 
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.590 align:start position:0%
a professional mediator who spends every
day

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
helping people settle their divorce and
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
parenting cases and while i'm kind of
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
semi-retired and maybe have done a
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
couple dozen cases in the last couple
 
00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:05.670 align:start position:0%
couple dozen cases in the last couple
years

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know i think he's done hundreds
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
so he has seen people
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
parents as a neutral he has seen parents
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
struggle with this question helps them
 
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
with their financial forms and what what
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
is the need how do we get the child
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
taken care of in both homes with
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
reasonable lifestyle and he seems to
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
have a pretty good success rate he'll
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
tell you more
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know i see this as challenging but
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
maybe it's my lesser skills in mediation
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
he seems to be generally successful in
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
getting people to come up with a
 
00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:39.749 align:start position:0%
getting people to come up with a
solution

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
so we didn't put a call out if that's
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
what you're asking we look for people
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
that had
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
lots of experience uh in in doing this
 
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
kind of work because if i've had a
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
thousand cases experience and someone
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
else in the group has had 1500 or more
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
and someone else has done
 
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.430 align:start position:0%
and someone else has done
500

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
500
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
you know the total number of cases that
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
we're bringing to it is really different
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
uh we knew that
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
when we got here to te you know to
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
having a hearing when you had a hearing
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
that you would be reaching out in a
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
different way and would have
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
parents but each parent just gives his
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
experience or her experience of one case
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
and without having the case file and
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
reading it
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
maybe even listening to the testimony if
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
it was recorded you can't really know
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.390 align:start position:0%
thank you so
i

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
i guess to summarize the question it was
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh the criteria was that you
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
you uh just looked in
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
for the people that you knew that that
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
had experience in this and you chose the
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
people to be on this working group is
 
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.950 align:start position:0%
people to be on this working group is
that

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
correct people volunteered
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh as you see looking at the bottom of
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
my testimony it's on page four we have
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
uh mary krueger who is here today
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
um and aaron jacina and they are with
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legal assistants
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
representing uh many
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
impoverished people in divorce marilyn
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
mahoney is
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
not here today because she had a
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
conflict but she has experience similar
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
to mine i think we both testified in 87
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
on that property bill has been
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
interested and testified on a lot of
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
policy questions
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
um as i mentioned i invited tony because
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
he's doing so much mediation and william
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
woodbury is uh
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
more of a generalist but does a lot of
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
family law and he's active in the new
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire association for justice so we
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
tried to get a diverse group didn't say
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
no to anybody but really we just needed
 
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
people who are willing to spend a lot of
 
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.430 align:start position:0%
people who are willing to spend a lot of
time

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
i mean i think the amount of hours we
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
spent in the last week
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
would be um
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i spent the equivalent of a day
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
and a half you know
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
30 hours or more myself and other people
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
spent some more time people who had the
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
time a couple retired lawyers a couple
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
of lawyers currently in practice so we
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have stale information
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
full-time mediator
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
i follow up
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
it's actually a new line of questioning
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
oh new line of collection
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:30.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
when you say uh
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
that the parents would have equal
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
capacity to
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
were there any
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
factors other than monetary that you
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
brought into that
 
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.270 align:start position:0%
brought into that
equation

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
equation
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
this was thank you for your question
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
this was not a bill about how to assign
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
parenting time again keep in mind
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 90 of parents get this
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
sorted out
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
less than 10
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
and i would say as to parenting probably
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
the percentage that settle or is even
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
higher i was talking about divorces
 
00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:17.669 align:start position:0%
higher i was talking about divorces
overall

00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
overall
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
but as to parenting most parents
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
who are certainly the specialists on
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
their children
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
make those decisions they may need some
 
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.310 align:start position:0%
make those decisions they may need some
help

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
with a case manager or a mediator in
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
saying you haven't done anything about
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
vacations won't there be vacations what
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
kind of schedule will you have that or
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
will the schedule be different in the
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
summer than it is in the school year
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
but they know the basic schedule
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
and hopefully they've actually been
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
living it for a month or two before they
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
write it down or carve it into the
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up other people have
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
what um
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that is currently
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
um in child support is that um
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
they're trying to figure out how much of
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
combined income would go towards the
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
raising of the child
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
um or the
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
how much money of that would go towards
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
the raising of the child and um in
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
shared and equal parenting time
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
or approximately equal parenting time um
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
some of that that
 
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.990 align:start position:0%
some of that that
money

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
would be spent while the person is
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
actually parenting and so
 
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.070 align:start position:0%
actually parenting and so
um

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is did when you were
 
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.909 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is did when you were
considering

00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
considering
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
the factors as far as
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
what is appropriate for
 
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.549 align:start position:0%
what is appropriate for
um

00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
required to pay the other person did the
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
amount that the money that they spent
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
actually raising the child
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
i know
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
the other bill that you spoke testified
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
about and i was able to listen to your
 
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.909 align:start position:0%
about and i was able to listen to your
testimony

00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
was dealing with changing the
 
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.950 align:start position:0%
was dealing with changing the
percentages

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
percentages
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
of the tables but let me say this that
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
since we've had the guidelines which is
 
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.430 align:start position:0%
since we've had the guidelines which is
1988

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
1988
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
the parent paying guidelines has always
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
paid has always spent more money on kids
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
than the guidelines this idea that that
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
number on the child support worksheet is
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
the you can't have require anyone to
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
spend a dollar more than what's on there
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
it's just not been the experience in new
 
00:22:58.799 --> 00:22:59.830 align:start position:0%
it's just not been the experience in new
hampshire

00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
people paid the guidelines amount to the
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
other parent in kind of traditional
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
schedules we're not talking about the
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
equal time schedule so much but
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
and they've always when they had the
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
child say in a traditional schedule of
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
alternate weekends and wednesday
 
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.070 align:start position:0%
alternate weekends and wednesday
overnight

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
overnight
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
then they still fed the kids on the
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
alternate weekends with their additional
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
money over what they had given to the
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
other parent
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
and on wednesday night and they took the
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
kids out for pizza or they went uh and
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
did some sport event with the children
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
this has always been so
 
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.310 align:start position:0%
this has always been so
it's

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
the idea that
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
they should not spend anything more on
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
the kids is
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
i think is not child focused and when
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
you come to equal time schedules
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
you have the additional consideration of
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's not it costs more to raise children
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
in two homes than in one
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
and that's why
 
00:23:57.279 --> 00:23:59.110 align:start position:0%
and that's why
the

00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.789 align:start position:0%
the
2018

00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
2018
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
unh report
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
i have some criticism but on this point
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
they're right it costs more if the kids
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
are have to be
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
outfitted with everything in both houses
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
they called for using a multiplier that
 
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
issue calculate the child support in the
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
usual fashion and you multiply that
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
child support number that guidelines
 
00:24:24.909 --> 00:24:24.919 align:start position:0%
number by
 
00:24:24.919 --> 00:24:26.789 align:start position:0%
number by
1.5

00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
1.5
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
to account for the fact that it takes
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
more to support kids in two households
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
and then a portion only then apportioned
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
it between the children and
 
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
that was in 1647 as introduced but
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
your amendment representative ukela
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
removed the 1.5 multiplier so that
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
that's a further problem it takes more
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
and it it takes more than guidelines to
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
raise a child especially if two
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
households have to be fully outfitted
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.510 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
taking into consideration your last
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
statement of it does cost more to
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
provide two homes for children i'm
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
looking at um on page one
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh line 28 roman numeral
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
six and
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh line three
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
it says here that
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
the variable expenses include but are
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
not limited to education
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
school supplies day care after school
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
programs vacation
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
so taking into consideration the
 
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
additional costs of running two homes
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
for these children
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
why would we make it a law
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
that specifically states
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
that if johnny wants to go to hawaii for
 
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:06.870 align:start position:0%
that if johnny wants to go to hawaii for
vacation

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
vacation
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
one or the other parent has to pay for
 
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.549 align:start position:0%
one or the other parent has to pay for
that

00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't see where after school
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
programs vacation and
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
summer camp should be included in the
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
law can you explain the thought process
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
there please thank you uh thank you for
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
your question representative di simone
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
so it appears that your question
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
primarily uh
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
is talking about what is on page
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
three that is
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
when the child support is adjusted that
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
these list these kind of child care
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
things need to be considered am i right
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
that your question primarily applies to
 
00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:43.269 align:start position:0%
that your question primarily applies to
that

00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
no it applies primarily to things like
 
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.310 align:start position:0%
no it applies primarily to things like
um

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.070 align:start position:0%
um
vacations

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
vacations
 
00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.430 align:start position:0%
vacations
uh

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
summer camp
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
driver's education
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
vacation is
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
is paramount to the child's well-being
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
or driver's education why would we put
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
that in law that should be something
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
that should
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
be agreed upon between the parents and
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
maybe a mediator
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
would you agree
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
well mediators don't make decisions for
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
parents we help them come to the
 
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.909 align:start position:0%
parents we help them come to the
decision

00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:27:21.919 --> 00:27:22.710 align:start position:0%
decision
um

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
so let i'm happy to clarify that
 
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.710 align:start position:0%
so let i'm happy to clarify that
so

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
the part that's on line 28 of of the
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
first page
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
which is essentially a definition of
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
variable expenses really relates to the
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
prior section five
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
so in ruling on requests for adjustment
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
because of the equal schedule the court
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
may doesn't have to may consider whether
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
the parties have agreed to specific
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
apportionment of variable expenses
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
and a procedure for for um implementing
 
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.029 align:start position:0%
and a procedure for for um implementing
that

00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:57.039 --> 00:27:57.750 align:start position:0%
that
so

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
um if someone's requesting uh variation
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
from the guidelines
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
the court can consider and this i think
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
would come up primarily in cases where
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
the parties in fact have agreed to a
 
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.110 align:start position:0%
the parties in fact have agreed to a
deviation

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
deviation
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
you can't just have in my experience as
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
a media i can't just say the parties
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to do guidelines
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
i have to put why i have to justify it
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
under the current law like shared
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
schedule and agreement to split these
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
costs that's the kind of thing i write
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
in the uniform support order
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know that the court would
 
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.110 align:start position:0%
i don't know that the court would
approve

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
approve
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
a non-guidelines order if i didn't write
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
in the reasons
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
so that the the fact that apportionment
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
of ex variable expenses is
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
something that can be used to justify a
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
variation in the guidelines
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
but they came to be as you've seen and
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
i've seen over the testimony recently of
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
the various child support bills
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
and because of silva
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
what is what is a variable expense so we
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
just simply said here's what we're
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
talking about so if if the parties are
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
saying please approve this we've already
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
sorted out all the expenses
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
then the court would be able to say
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
okay i've seen you've done that and as
 
00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.789 align:start position:0%
okay i've seen you've done that and as
to

00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh the part that's on page three roman
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
um numeral uh seven
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
here's here's the the concern as i said
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
right now there's a presumption of how
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
those daycare costs are met the person
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
getting this the guideline support gets
 
00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:33.430 align:start position:0%
getting this the guideline support gets
it

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
but it's not clear what happens if
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
there's not guideline support
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
and you know the allocation may be
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
equal sharing of it and and it's if they
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
agree to it i mean if in fact there's no
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
after-school care because
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
the people kids are teens
 
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.950 align:start position:0%
the people kids are teens
or

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
the little ones are with one of the
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
grandmoms who doesn't ask for any money
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
then it's there's no cost but if there
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
is a cost
 
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
and for most families there is a cost
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
which is only increasing each week it
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
seems then
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
the qu we're saying the court can't
 
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.230 align:start position:0%
the qu we're saying the court can't
um

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
adjust the child support without
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
deciding that one way or another it may
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
be that one parent still has enough to
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
pay the whole cost and maybe you want to
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
take those percentages on the worksheet
 
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
and divide up the child care you know 60
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
40 or whatever the percentages were so
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
this does not require anyone to approve
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
of vacations
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
or any of those other things it's just
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
if if they do
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
agree on that then that could be a
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
factor in approving
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
yeah you can definitely say no to no
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
vacations i mean no summer camp
 
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
i want the kids to stay home that's a
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
parental decision
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative belanger
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and providing
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
barring any unforeseen domestic violence
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
or any issues right assuming that a
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
family is
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
let's say normal i'm putting that in air
 
00:31:11.519 --> 00:31:12.389 align:start position:0%
let's say normal i'm putting that in air
quotes

00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
quotes
 
00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:13.269 align:start position:0%
quotes
right

00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:16.230 align:start position:0%
right
um

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
do you agree that if there are two
 
00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.110 align:start position:0%
do you agree that if there are two
parents

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:19.990 align:start position:0%
parents
um

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
in a situation
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
taking out any negative scenario
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
that they should be sharing
 
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.110 align:start position:0%
that they should be sharing
custody

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
time parenting time thank you i'm sorry
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
i was just going to
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
i got it
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you if we could only get the
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
supreme court to use the right words um
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
i wrote i wrote the parental rights and
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
responsibilities act that got rid of
 
00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:52.630 align:start position:0%
responsibilities act that got rid of
custody

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
custody
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
so i i kind of take it personally
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
parents very few parents fail to share
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
the care of their children
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
sharing doesn't mean 50 50.
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
most parents work out the plan for the
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
and the timing of
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
the sharing
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
unless there's some very good reason
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
someone is incarcerated um there's been
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
violence particularly violence against
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
the children
 
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.590 align:start position:0%
the children
um

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
someone is stationed in the far east
 
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
absent some reason like that well it's
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's written in the parental rights and
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
responsibilities law
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
most kids do better when they have
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
frequent irregular contact with both
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
parents i believe that i believe that
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
but most parents do not choose a 50 50
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
schedule an increasing number to do
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
1982 when i started practicing
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
and the male lawyers in my in nashua
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take a guy who wanted
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
sharing or more custody which we had
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
then um because they couldn't understand
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
why he'd want it
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
but things have changed society has
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
changed and i think it's for the benefit
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
of children some people work in boston
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
and have a long commute
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
the other the other parent hopefully has
 
00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:15.350 align:start position:0%
the other the other parent hopefully has
stayed

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
stayed
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
with a maybe parents hours job locally
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
or a job from home and so to say that
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
the time has to be equal i don't know
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
how you do it one parent is simply not
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
as available
 
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.350 align:start position:0%
as available
um

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
there are the schedules of um
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
uniform services which have a rotating
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
schedule it's really
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
challenging to come up with a time
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
but it's typically
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
following something that has been worked
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
out in terms of the work schedules and
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
availability of each parent there are
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
also some parents
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
who don't want parenting as much as
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
public policy would say would be good
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
for children and i think that's
 
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.909 align:start position:0%
for children and i think that's
regrettable

00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
regrettable
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
but that is true
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's usually though
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
practicalities including work schedules
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
that mean a 50 50 schedule just simply
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
won't work for all parents
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
they decide if they decide
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
alternate weekends wednesday night but
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
more time in the summer is what works
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
for them who are we to say no you must
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
have the children fifty percent of the
 
00:34:25.839 --> 00:34:30.470 align:start position:0%
have the children fifty percent of the
time

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative all chiller
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry follow up
 
00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.109 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry follow up
sorry

00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for your
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
question i think
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for your answer
 
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.109 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for your answer
sorry

00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not here today either
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
um i'll thank you for your question
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
which has got me thinking dealing with
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
stuff at work it's not great um ah so
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
in my in and i'm gonna preface this so
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
in my instance um i own a business
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
right and
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know i may pay for everything but
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
what you alluded to was that it is more
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
costly to
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
to provide two homes so my expectation
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
is while i see my kids on a regular
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
basis now of course my wife and i aren't
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
separated but in the instance that we
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
were my expectation would be to be
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
paying for both of these houses i'm
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
still seeing both my kids but
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
i mean we've got to figure out a way to
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
to drop this down but in in the instance
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
that it cost
 
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.829 align:start position:0%
that it cost
um

00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
to your point where you said it cost
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
more to
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
have two homes to pay for two homes
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
is is it your expectation that if a
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
parent is
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
sharing equal parenting time
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
i said that right that time good that
 
00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:51.829 align:start position:0%
i said that right that time good that
they're

00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
not paying
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
i think what we need is what's fair to
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
kids and if what's fair to kids again i
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
don't see the guidelines number as a
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
magic number and it would be against
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
public policy for parents to spend any
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
more on their children than what the
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines number produces because since
 
00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.829 align:start position:0%
guidelines number produces because since
88

00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
88
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
guidelines paying parents have still fed
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
their children during their
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
time which used to be called visitation
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
but of course we don't use that word
 
00:36:26.079 --> 00:36:27.190 align:start position:0%
but of course we don't use that word
either

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it's harmful if you
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
look at and i know the courts would
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
look at the budgets of both household
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
look at the income when the income is so
 
00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.670 align:start position:0%
look at the income when the income is so
much

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
higher after paying guidelines support
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
the hi the high income parent
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
in most scenarios is still going to have
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
more available income after child
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
support than the parent who receives
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
child support you need to look at
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
examples and again i
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
tony will say more about that and has an
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
exhibit that talks about that more so
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
i hope you'll ask some of those
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
questions again with with his material
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
in hand
 
00:37:07.359 --> 00:37:08.710 align:start position:0%
in hand
okay

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
okay representative all chiller
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you very
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
much for being here today i wouldn't i
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
want to dial back
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
um and just for a clarification
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
in current statute
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
in 458 c
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
part a which reflects
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended by the senate lines
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
28 and 29 i want to clarify that the
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
variable expenses the first seven are
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
include but aren't limited to education
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
school supplies day care after school
 
00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:44.710 align:start position:0%
school supplies day care after school
programs

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
the words here are vacation and summer
 
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.829 align:start position:0%
the words here are vacation and summer
care

00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:49.839 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
then followed by extracurricular
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
activity so vacation and summer care
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
is actually referencing when schools are
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
not in session that's right and thank
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
you for calling that to my attention i
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
didn't catch that
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
when i was trying to answer
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
representative simone's question uh but
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's talking about um february vacation
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
april vacation
 
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.069 align:start position:0%
april vacation
um

00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
and and again those are
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
some of the biggest out-of-pocket
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
expenses parents have
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
you know that if you have kids or
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
grandkids uh so
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
um that that's just huge especially the
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
little kids
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
right so may finish my question so my
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
in pointing that out was if one of the
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
one of the parents
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
has the available um
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
disposable income to take
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
their children on a vacation up to lake
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee during the summer and the
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
other parent does not have the
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
disposable income
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
to take their children on a vacation up
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
to lake winnipesaukee for the summer
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
this bill does not require that the
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
parent with that disposable income
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
provide that to the parent that doesn't
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
so that they each get an equal vacation
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
do you have a question anybody else
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
all right seeing that oh okay
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
representative we're really running
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
short on time so
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
now that we are uh
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
i now that um
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
everyone else has a chance um i had a
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
question about um
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
you mentioned this uh that the cost
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
um for having two households is
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
is increased
 
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.790 align:start position:0%
is increased
and

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
how is that
 
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.870 align:start position:0%
how is that
um

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
dealt with in this proposed legislation
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
as far as the increased costs
 
00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:57.670 align:start position:0%
as far as the increased costs
um

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.230 align:start position:0%
um
being

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
necessary for to
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
to income household especially how does
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
it address the increased costs
 
00:40:07.119 --> 00:40:08.790 align:start position:0%
it address the increased costs
with

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
people that have
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.670 align:start position:0%
let's say
61

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
61
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
of a difference
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
of income
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh 61 49
 
00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.270 align:start position:0%
uh 61 49
well

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you that's uh for your question
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
what we what we found in the examples
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
please ask them when you have the
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
scenarios um
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
is at that income level at 60 or more
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
after that parent paid the guidelines
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
which would enable the other parent to
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
maintain the children
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
the uh the guidelines payer still had
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
more money
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
than the lower income parent
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
still had more and yes
 
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.710 align:start position:0%
still had more and yes
again

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
it would require paying dollars that are
 
00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:58.790 align:start position:0%
it would require paying dollars that are
not

00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
in the guidelines numbers i said that i
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
think it's a mistaken idea that that's
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
the limit on what parents could spend
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
so yes but there's enough and
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
that higher income person by our
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
calculations had enough
 
00:41:13.359 --> 00:41:14.069 align:start position:0%
calculations had enough
to

00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
support him or herself and the children
 
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
yes more than the guidelines could be
 
00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.750 align:start position:0%
yes more than the guidelines could be
spent

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
spent
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you um
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
would you agree that
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
that the guidelines are
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
not a maximum amount but actually a
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
minimum amount that is required to be
 
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.270 align:start position:0%
minimum amount that is required to be
spent

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
spent
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
because that is what is
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
required to be paid to the
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
um other person that is available for
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
that money to be spent on the children
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
i certainly agree that it's not the
 
00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:55.589 align:start position:0%
i certainly agree that it's not the
maximum

00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
maximum
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
um i wouldn't say it's the minimum
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
because in fact this bill proposes cases
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
where the guidelines would not be paid
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
so in cases that
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
under our bill
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines should be used then i guess
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
it could be except there are other
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
factors in 458
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
5 for varying from the guidelines other
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
than parenting time and it has to do
 
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.270 align:start position:0%
than parenting time and it has to do
with

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
extraordinary health expenses the cost
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
of college of kids i don't remember the
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
whole list but there's there's four or
 
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
five other factors that could be uh
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know a very high income a very low
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
income those also are reasons for
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
varying so the guidelines are kind of
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up thank you um
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
in in um
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
referencing to this variable expenses
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
and uh deviations
 
00:42:55.839 --> 00:42:57.109 align:start position:0%
and uh deviations
um

00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:57.119 --> 00:42:58.390 align:start position:0%
um
could

00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.390 align:start position:0%
could
someone

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.190 align:start position:0%
someone
um

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
where they haven't agreed
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
where one parent is going to hawaii
 
00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.030 align:start position:0%
where one parent is going to hawaii
and

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
and request the the court to
 
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.470 align:start position:0%
and request the the court to
um

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
to have a deviation because they hold on
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
one second because they address that
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
this is not regarding a vacation going
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere it's regarding school
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
would you agree that it says other child
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
related expenses and not limited to oh i
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
would agree okay thank you
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
um so that's not what you were asking so
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
so would you um agree that
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to agree about the
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
variable expense before they go to court
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
to request a deviation for
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
that variable expense cost
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
they don't have to ever agree on
 
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
variable expenses but they can't use it
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
as a factor to justify an exception to
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
the guidelines unless they agree we
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
haven't changed the law on this as far
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
as the court deciding about variable
 
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.550 align:start position:0%
as the court deciding about variable
expenses

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.069 align:start position:0%
expenses
except

00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
except
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
daycare which we've indicated the court
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
has to do that if it deviates if it
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't deviate it doesn't have to
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%

spend some time working on this issue
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
because this had there had been bills
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
that had been introduced that

that had been introduced that
that

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
that people felt had not solved the
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
problem yet
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
so i agreed to be a member of this group
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that i am
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
a neutral
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's the way i earn my living
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
so i work equally for the people who are
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
paying child support and for the people
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
who are receiving child support
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
if at any time i show a bias toward one
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
of those parents or the other
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
i have failed to do my job so
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
i have to be able to look at these
 
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
issues help people reach agreement
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
but not take a position
 
00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.309 align:start position:0%
but not take a position
that

00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
favors one client or the other
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
i will tell you i have worked with
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
hundreds of families resolving this
 
00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.670 align:start position:0%
hundreds of families resolving this
issue

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
and i have never
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
encountered a family that was not
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
stay at the table and work at this that
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
has not been able to resolve child
 
00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.069 align:start position:0%
has not been able to resolve child
support

00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
what that means is
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
what this i think that the legislature
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire has done an excellent
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
job of providing people like me
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
mediators who work with families trying
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
to resolve the issue
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
00:47:46.079 --> 00:47:47.109 align:start position:0%
as well as
judges

00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
judges
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
in those
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
minority of cases that are forced to
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
make decisions because parents cannot
 
00:47:53.119 --> 00:47:54.230 align:start position:0%
make decisions because parents cannot
agree

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
the law that you have in place now
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
allows me to do my job
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
it gives me the tools i need to have
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
these people make decisions and settle
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
these cases themselves
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
and what i will say about i would say
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
the majority of my cases involve
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
approximately equal parenting schedules
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
because in the law it says that children
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
do best when each parent has
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
a meaningful continuing contact the
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
child has that with each parent it's
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
encouraged that each parent spend as
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
much time as possible so parents agree
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
to that in the majority of cases that i
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
work on
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
but at the same time what they agree to
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of child support varies
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
depending on the specific circumstances
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
in each case
 
00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:46.710 align:start position:0%
in each case
so

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
let's bring common sense into this if we
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
have one parent who earns twenty
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a month and another
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
parent who earns two thousand dollars a
 
00:48:56.559 --> 00:48:57.750 align:start position:0%
parent who earns two thousand dollars a
month

00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
and i've i've passed out
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
a child support guidelines worksheet
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
that i
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
helped a family complete a week ago
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
in that case
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
one parent earned 160 000 a year the
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
other parent earned 30 000 a year
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
they had five children
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
the guideline said i believe it's thirty
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
three hundred and two dollars
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
in that case the higher earner was the
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
father they had an equal parenting
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
schedule and the father said of course
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna pay the guideline amount
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
of child support just look at my income
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
and reduce my income by that 3 300
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
and add it to the to the mom's income
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
and you can see i still have a huge
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
disparity in income i can support the
 
00:49:45.599 --> 00:49:46.630 align:start position:0%
disparity in income i can support the
children

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
fine on my end so
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
what the law is is we're trying to we
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
have to keep the focus on the welfare of
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
the children because what's good for the
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
children is good for the parents
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
i'm a parent of five children i don't
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
know how many of you have children
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
but i learned a long time ago that a
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
parent can only be as happy as their
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
unhappiest child
 
00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.150 align:start position:0%
unhappiest child
so

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
that is that is what it is and that's
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
what i try to keep
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
my clients focus on i don't care what
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
you agree to it has to make sense
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
to you
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
so in equal parenting cases if you have
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
two parents who are in similar incomes
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
and have the children a similar amount
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
of time in a case like that most parents
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
agree to no child support
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
we have equal income and we have equal
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
expenses we have the kids an equal
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
amount of time it's common sense
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
so they they put in in these agreements
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
that are presented to the court no child
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
support in a case like that i have never
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
had a judge fail to sign that order okay
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
or ever question it
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
if you have two people with this example
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
i just gave you they agree to guideline
 
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
support it's common sense
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
this is not something that's
 
00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.470 align:start position:0%
this is not something that's
controversial

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
where you get to the to the area and
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
then there's everything in between i
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
have many clients that don't agree to
 
00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.230 align:start position:0%
have many clients that don't agree to
guidelines

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
but they agree to something just less
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
than the guidelines
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
so uh representative yokela you asked a
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
lot of good questions and i think one of
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
them was what do you do in a case when
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's 61
 
00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.710 align:start position:0%
it's 61
39

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
39
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
right and the the answer is that you use
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
judgment and common sense is the
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
guidelines right well maybe what we're
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
doing is putting bumpers in the bowling
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
alley with this uh senate bill 431
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
the high end is guidelines amount the
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
low end
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
is zero
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
but in k but in cases we have net the
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
difference right we put that lower that
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
lower bumper there that has never
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
existed before and actually this net the
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
distance difference idea has never been
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
articulated in law before
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
so that is what we're doing we're
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
providing it's you guys have given us
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
the tools we have the tools if you had a
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
carpenter come to your house and he
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
butchered the job are you going to blame
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
the hammer no you're going to blame the
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
person who's using the hammer we have
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
the tools
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
the we don't want to throw out right now
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
there was an article in the concord
 
00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.430 align:start position:0%
there was an article in the concord
monitor

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
monitor
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
several months ago that talked about the
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
data for new hampshire children we rank
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
second in the country on the metrics
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
associated with child well-being
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
that's because of what this body has
 
00:52:32.559 --> 00:52:33.510 align:start position:0%
that's because of what this body has
done

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
to put the focus on children we only
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
have seven i say only it's too much
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
seven percent of our children in this
 
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.230 align:start position:0%
seven percent of our children in this
state

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
live below the poverty line the national
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
average is
 
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.069 align:start position:0%
average is
17

00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
17
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's a 143 percent
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
more than what we have accomplished in
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
this state
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
so this is not the problems that people
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
are talking about here and the people
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
who testify against this bill are
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
well-meaning people they're not bad
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
people they may have had a bad
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
experience and they look at these laws
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
through the prism of that experience
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
i'm telling you
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at this from a neutral
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
standpoint i spent i can't tell you how
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
many hours i spent
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
working with this group to try to come
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
up with this solution i think it solves
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
the problem without overstepping and
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
throwing out the baby with the bath
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
water and hurting harming children uh in
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
the long run we don't want to be in a
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
position five or ten years from now
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
where the concord monitor is writing an
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
article about how we've fallen from
 
00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.349 align:start position:0%
article about how we've fallen from
second

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
to twenty-seventh okay that's it i get a
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
handful of other people that want to
 
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative yocala
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for uh taking the
 
00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.030 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for uh taking the
question

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.910 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
it seems like there is um
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
equaling or
 
00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.829 align:start position:0%
equaling or
um

00:54:13.829 --> 00:54:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
reducing the difference between
 
00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.750 align:start position:0%
reducing the difference between
um

00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
more uh so that they
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
have the
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
e more equal standard of living at each
 
00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:31.589 align:start position:0%
e more equal standard of living at each
um

00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:31.599 --> 00:54:32.549 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
household instead of that each parent
 
00:54:36.079 --> 00:54:36.789 align:start position:0%
household instead of that each parent
has

00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
the ability to pay for
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
their share of the
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
um response
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
their parental support obligation
 
00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:50.870 align:start position:0%
their parental support obligation
um

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
can you
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
that uh question sure certainly
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
so i think i think there's again what i
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
see in my office is there is a general
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
rejection of the idea that any amount of
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
child support is going to flip incomes
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
so that the person who earns more pays
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
so much child support that now they're
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
earning less after child support is paid
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
that's again common sense that's
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
something that every client understands
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
i've never had anybody propose anything
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
like that right and we're not talking
 
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.589 align:start position:0%
like that right and we're not talking
about

00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
the the goal is so that children can
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
have a similar experience in both
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
households because
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
it is in the current law which i think
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
is good law
 
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
there is a recognition that children do
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
best if they don't view one parent as
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
the parent who is able to support them
 
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
and the other parent as the parent who
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
is incapable of providing that support
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
in their household so they go to one
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
house and they live in opulence and they
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
can afford to do all these things they
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
go to the other house they don't have
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
their own bed they're sleeping on the
 
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:05.910 align:start position:0%
their own bed they're sleeping on the
couch

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
couch
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
there aren't enough bedrooms if you have
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
teenage boys and girls you need a
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
three-bedroom place or
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
so so there are there are realities
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
the financial affidavit again talking
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
about common sense the financial
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
affidavit on page one lists the income
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
on page three
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
every client every parent that goes in
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
front of the files a petition with the
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
court has to show what their reasonable
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
expenses are when they're filing a joint
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
petition each party has to agree that
 
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
what's on the other party's financial
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
affidavit is reasonable
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
so if one person is earning twenty five
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a month working full
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
time and on page three reasonable
 
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
expenses are thirty five hundred dollars
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
a month
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
that is not sustainable a thousand
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
dollar a month deficit so if the other
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
party has the surplus has the income
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
to supplement the first party's income
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that that person since they
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
have the children and they are the other
 
00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:07.910 align:start position:0%
have the children and they are the other
parent

00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
is more appropriate to be providing that
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
support than the state would be so so in
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
effect it isn't to equalize the incomes
 
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's for one parent if necessary to
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
provide enough income to the other
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
parent so that they can provide again a
 
00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:26.390 align:start position:0%
parent so that they can provide again a
similar

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
lifestyle not the same vacation to
 
00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.990 align:start position:0%
lifestyle not the same vacation to
hawaii

00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
hawaii
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
but a similar experience for the kids in
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
each home
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up
 
00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:45.510 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up
um

00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
i i rather move on to
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative belanger thank you madam
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you uh tony yeah for
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
being here today i appreciate your
 
00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.630 align:start position:0%
being here today i appreciate your
testimony

00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
i am by no means an expert in child
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
support i'm a child of child support and
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
i don't necessarily agree with it
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
however my question
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
is i don't quite understand so if a
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
parent on scenario two parent a is gross
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
grossing we're talking about this is
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
your salary your salary is sixty five
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars correct we're not
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
talking about after taxes
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about in scenario two one
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
parent earn 65 000 the other parent
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
earned 60 000 correct and again we're
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
talking about gross per year yep correct
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
before taxes yep
 
00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:30.559 align:start position:0%
may i continue madam chair please do
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
we're running out of time so assuming
 
00:58:33.359 --> 00:58:34.470 align:start position:0%
we're running out of time so assuming
that

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
this parent is uh obligated to pay 10
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
000.92 based on your 841 dollar per
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
month calculation
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
is that is that correct no it's not
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
correct because in that scenario the
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
person that would be paying child
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
support only earns 52
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
of the combined income so in that case
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
net the difference would be the presumed
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
amount or would be the the amount that
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
would be allowed so where you look at
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
the highlights i'm sorry i didn't
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
explain this chart
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the scenarios here
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
there are five scenarios
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
in the first two scenarios the incomes
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
the income of the higher earning parent
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
is less than 60 percent of the total
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
income that's why in our bill in 431 it
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
would say that net the difference is an
 
00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.750 align:start position:0%
would say that net the difference is an
appropriate

00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.710 align:start position:0%
appropriate
option

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
option
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
so rather than the eight
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
rather than the 841 dollars we're saying
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
it would be appropriate for that higher
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
earning parent to pay only seventeen
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
dollars a month
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
and then if you look at this uh if you
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
go over to the right of that seventeen
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
dollars it shows what the parents income
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
would be after paying support and after
 
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
receiving support
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
so in that scenario the person paying
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
child support instead of fifty four
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
hundred sixteen dollars they have fifty
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
four hundred the other parent instead of
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
five thousand has five thousand
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
seventeen dollars the difference in
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
incomes are shown in that far right
 
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.630 align:start position:0%
incomes are shown in that far right
column

01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
column
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the last three
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
scenarios those are scenarios where the
 
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
higher earning parent actually earns
 
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
more than 60 percent of the combined
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
gross monthly income which is more than
 
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
one and a half times the lower earning
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
parent so in those cases we're saying
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
the guideline amount would not be
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate it still would be the
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
presumed amount however the parties can
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
agree to deviate which they do every day
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
in my office or a judge can look at the
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
factors and say you know what guidelines
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
maybe isn't appropriate in this case
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
because of these factors and order
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
something less than the guidelines
 
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate your question because
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
yes you're right if we were to use the
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines what we concluded doing our
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
analysis is if the guidelines were
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
ordered in that case that probably would
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
not be fair
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
so i agree with you 100 percent
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and thank you madam
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
chair i'm also thank you
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
you have a question representative
 
01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.309 align:start position:0%
you have a question representative
yokola

01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
yokola
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
so in in um
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
scenario two
 
01:01:02.319 --> 01:01:04.150 align:start position:0%
scenario two
you

01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
you agree that right now
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
under the current guidelines it is
 
01:01:10.319 --> 01:01:11.670 align:start position:0%
under the current guidelines it is
unfair

01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
unfair
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
no because under the current guidelines
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
the guidelines
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
there the guide there's a guideline
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
amount and then there are
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
many many reasons
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
why a judge that the judge can factor in
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
when deciding that the guidelines would
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
not be fair so the guidelines would not
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
be ordered in a case
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
in that in this case so this idea and
 
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
i've heard this testimony before that if
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
one parent earns one dollar more than
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
the other parent they're going to be
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
ordered to pay the guidelines that is
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
untrue that has never happened to my
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge and it has never happened in
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
my office in hundreds of cases i will
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
tell you that
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
so i feel like that
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer your question
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
one more i still have three more
 
01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.710 align:start position:0%
one more i still have three more
speakers

01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
but this this is the public hearing and
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
we need that i understand that there are
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
three other people that may have answers
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
for you also
 
01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.109 align:start position:0%
for you also
that's

01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
possible but um
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
do you do you um
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
agree that in
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
the supreme court's ruling in silva v
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
silva says that a deviation is not
 
01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
allowed for um
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
the fact that it is equal um
 
01:02:29.599 --> 01:02:30.549 align:start position:0%
the fact that it is equal um
that

01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
that parents have equal parenting time
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
and so that is not even though currently
 
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
in the law it says that it's not the
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
sole reason that the the the court has
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
ruled that to be not a reason
 
01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely not that is a
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of the silva
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh ruling
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
the supreme court the lower court in
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
that case found that there was
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
justification for a deviation from the
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines based on the fact that the
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
obligor the person paying child support
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
had shown
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
that there was a reduction in fixed
 
01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.870 align:start position:0%
that there was a reduction in fixed
costs

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
to the obligate or the person receiving
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
child supports fixed costs
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
the judge in the lower court went on to
 
01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.950 align:start position:0%
the judge in the lower court went on to
articulate

01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
articulate
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
what those fixed cost reductions were
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
and every one of the fixed costs that
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
they articulated in the law in the in
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
the ruling was not a fixed cost but
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
rather a variable cost so what the
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
higher court did what the supreme court
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
said was
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
when the lower court looked at this
 
01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.470 align:start position:0%
when the lower court looked at this
issue

01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
they could have it would have been
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
possible if the reduction in fixed costs
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
were actually fixed costs that were
 
01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.069 align:start position:0%
were actually fixed costs that were
reduced

01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
that it would have been uh justified a
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
deviation it could have justified a
 
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
deviation from the guidelines but the
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
lower court didn't say that the lower
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
court said it reduced fixed expenses and
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
then used as examples of those fixed
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
expenses several variable expenses in
 
01:04:02.079 --> 01:04:02.950 align:start position:0%
expenses several variable expenses in
fact

01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
what they listed were in the definition
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
of variable expenses
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
in the law
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
so the lower court clearly made a
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
mistake the higher court had nothing
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
else to do but to rule that the lower
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
court had made and throw it back to the
 
01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
lower court and say if you want to do a
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
deviation based on a change in fixed
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
expenses then show us
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
which fixed expenses were actually
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
reduced so that's what it was about it
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't saying that you cannot

provide the committee with some

information
 
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.280 align:start position:0%

department of health and human services
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
as required by statute is currently
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
going through a guidelines review year
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
this year and we do anticipate that the
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
review will
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
yield some very helpful
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
and recommendations
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to consider
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
in regards to the child support
 
01:06:14.559 --> 01:06:15.990 align:start position:0%
in regards to the child support
guidelines

01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
certainly the review considers the
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
economic data of the cost of raising
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
children and includes an analysis of
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
case data
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
on the application of and the deviations
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
from the current child support
 
01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.870 align:start position:0%
from the current child support
guidelines

01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
and will
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
provide recommendations and findings and
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
an analysis
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
of current
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
data available to us for the purposes of
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
the quadrennial review
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
the report is anticipated to be
 
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
completed by the end of this calendar
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
year as of december 31st

of 2022
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
and again we just want the committee to
 
01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
be aware that we do anticipate that this
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
review report of our current child
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
support guidelines and the data that is
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
available to us will hopefully yield to
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
some helpful recommendations
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%

01:10:50.159 --> 01:10:51.189 align:start position:0%
protection order cases and family law
cases

01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:10:51.199 --> 01:10:52.149 align:start position:0%
cases
we

01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
prioritize cases that are high lethality
 
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
cases and those are cases where
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
and so we see some of the the worst
 
01:11:05.199 --> 01:11:06.470 align:start position:0%
and so we see some of the the worst
cases

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
that you can imagine going through our
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
family courts
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
i've been doing this since 2006.
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
i was part of the alimony working group
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
and we were really looking out for the
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
interests of domestic violence survivors
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be any law change to
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
child support that can have a huge
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
impact it can also have a huge impact on
 
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
people living in poverty
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
children in poverty
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
and we're very concerned
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
when we see changes
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
being made to policy around child
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
support in our state
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
because we want to ensure that children
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
more children don't go into poverty new
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire does
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
quite well
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
and is second um in the nation in terms
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
of the lowest poverty rate um and we'd
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
like to to see it stay that way this
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
bill here really just focuses in on one
 
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.110 align:start position:0%
bill here really just focuses in on one
aspect

01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
of the current law
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
that would address equal and
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
approximately equal parenting schedules
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
it still presumes that the guideline
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
amount is the amount of child support
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
and we think that that is an important
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
policy to maintain because domestic
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
violence abusers use coercive control
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
in the form of violence and financial
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
control in addition to emotional and
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
psychological control the financial
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
component can be used as a way to keep a
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
victim in the relationship
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
oftentimes abusers are the higher
 
01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.229 align:start position:0%
oftentimes abusers are the higher
earners

01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
earners
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes abused victims aren't allowed
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
to work or only allowed to work very low
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
wage jobs
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
if we have a situation where an abuser
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
is incentivized to decide to fight over
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
parenting time
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
an otherwise uninvolved abusive parent
 
01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
may decide to do that if they see that
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
there's an incentive to lower their
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
with this change it just provides more
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
precise parameters keeping the best
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
interest of the children
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
in mind
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
so that the courts we litigate a number
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
of cases so
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
i'd like to be able to mediate probably
 
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
50 percent of my cases do settle
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
um often when i have a good attorney on
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
the other side we can be the reasonable
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
people to help
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
move things along but we litigate
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
probably 50 percent of our family law
 
01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.030 align:start position:0%
probably 50 percent of our family law
cases

01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
when we look at this law i'm looking at
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
is how a judge is going to apply it
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
and the judge is going to keep front and
 
01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.709 align:start position:0%
and the judge is going to keep front and
center

01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
center
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the children
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
and to look at the lower earning parent
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that per parent can
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
continue to meet the cost of child
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
rearing in a similar or approximately
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
equal style as to that of the other
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
parent and that those are the policies
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
that would be in place that a judge
 
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
would have to apply
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
in order to decide if they're going to
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
go to the next step of adjusting a child
 
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.070 align:start position:0%
go to the next step of adjusting a child
support

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
when the parties don't agree and we
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
believe that that's a strong an
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
important policy to preserve
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
especially for children who have been
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
suffering in domestic violence homes
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
this also is protective of low-income
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
people because we have those bumpers in
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
the bowling alley as
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
tony mentioned where
 
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
if the court does decide to
 
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
adjust it it's in a fair way where
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
people are earning similar incomes and
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
we think we often have parents who are
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
both low income and that that's a fair
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
if there is an equal or approximately
 
01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:08.790 align:start position:0%
if there is an equal or approximately
equal

01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
equal
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
parenting schedule and we do have cases
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
that that have those um schedules um we
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
have two low-income parents that the
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
difference could be a really good tool
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
for a court to use in order to have a
 
01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:22.790 align:start position:0%
for a court to use in order to have a
fair

01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
fair
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
amount of support so the parents can
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
share the income across the household
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative yokela
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
there were more uh
 
01:15:41.679 --> 01:15:43.189 align:start position:0%
there were more uh
recommendations

01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
than just addressing the um the equal
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
and shared parenting time
 
01:15:49.199 --> 01:15:50.070 align:start position:0%
and shared parenting time
uh

01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
question inside of the 2018 study
 
01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.910 align:start position:0%
question inside of the 2018 study
um

01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
is there a reason that
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
maybe the
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
the working group did not
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
broach any of the other suggestions that
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
were made in that study
 
01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:08.470 align:start position:0%
were made in that study
we

01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes we were not looking at broad policy
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
change for the child support law we were
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
looking at this very narrow special
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
circumstance that's current currently in
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
regarding equal or approximately legal
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
parenting time
 
01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
mainly that is because
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
i've been in and out of this legislature
 
01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
for a number of years
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
along with honey hastings sitting on
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
some committees
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that keeps coming up
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
about the equal or approximately equal
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
parenting time and how to better guide
 
01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.149 align:start position:0%
parenting time and how to better guide
courts

01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
courts
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
in making decisions around that given
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
that more families are you know doing
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
equal and approximately equal parenting
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
time so it's been an issue in front of
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
this committee many times um and that's
 
01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
something that we really felt that we
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
could really devote the time and energy
 
01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
and brain power to figuring out so that
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
was exactly what we had
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
committed to doing um to senator carson
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%

take out is what the job scientists came
 
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
up with after years of research
 
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
um i'm uh
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
a father of two lovely young ladies i'm
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
part from rockingham county i'm just a
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
father who's been living this uh the
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
current guidelines uh since 2018 um i've
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
spoken on this matter a few times and
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
have uh actually had reached out to the
 
01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
working group several times as well and
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
have spoken with tony machamolo and
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
reached out to honey hastings aries
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
aaron jazzy as well i'm here today just
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
to talk about sp 431 and the the um
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
devastating nature of our current
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines which i think sp 431 would
 
01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
turn into legislatures so
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
since silva v silva i think we're all
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
aware of it it hasn't mentioned very
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
much but this is the reality every uh
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
judge is by precedent case law follows
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
silva v silva there are rarely
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
exceptions the mentions of mediation
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
which is great and would be wonderful if
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
most parents could qualify for mediation
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
and work through that process but most
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
cannot because of there were words like
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
agreement mediation
 
01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
most of them end up in court most of
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
them end up having child support laws
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
and guidelines established by
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
individual family courts and judges and
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
since 2018 and this is reality it's my
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
reality and for most every other parent
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
they actually
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
um established because of silly silva
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
that the two criteria were mentioned one
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
is uh reduction of fixed cost
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
and also equal or approximately equal
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
parenting time are not justifications by
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
themselves for a deviation from
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines so what that means is
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
whether a hiring parent and lowering
 
01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.550 align:start position:0%
whether a hiring parent and lowering
parent

01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
parent
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
have 50 50 parenting time i have my
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
children over 55 of the time
 
01:19:27.669 --> 01:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
it does not matter the lower earner
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
receives all the funds available i think
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
everyone would agree in this group uh
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
everyone that spoke that you know we
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
know parenting is best for 50 of the
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
time that parents children do best with
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
both of their parents
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
because of that that's that is the the
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
truth and in my case very much but what
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
happens is all the funds go just to one
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
household the lower earner and it was
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
stated previously and i'll say it again
 
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
that means one dollar less than the
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
higher earner so what would i actually
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
if i could pass out some of the uh
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
reference material thank you
 
01:19:59.199 --> 01:19:59.990 align:start position:0%
reference material thank you
um

01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
and this it's in this you get a chance a
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
well there's not enough copies for it i
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
think i have eight copies
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
yeah there's more than
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
i had one that got chewed by her
 
01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:19.669 align:start position:0%
i had one that got chewed by her
guys

01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
guys
 
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
and i'll try and hit the high points and
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
do this quickly
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
so what that means is and i've
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
provided some of the calculations um and
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
this has been since 2018 of course so if
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
the lower order makes a dollar or just
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
one dollar less all of those funds go to
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
the lower earner uh this is reality this
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
is not something that's conjecture or
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
subjective as a lot of the words you
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
heard and i want to talk about 431 in a
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
second but this is because of silvery
 
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
silva what actually would happen with
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
431 it was take that and make it law so
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't actually even be precedent
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
anymore it would make it law and the
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
very important parts of this that are so
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
critical of this
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
are how it actually does that so
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
the only relief that would be provided
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
and i think everyone agrees and it i
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
noted in here the study that was done by
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
the by the carsey school the dartmouth
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
study also the national parenting group
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
that gave the state of new hampshire an
 
01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:14.390 align:start position:0%
that gave the state of new hampshire an
f

01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
f
 
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
we pay the third highest amount in the
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
country we are we pay a thousand dollars
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
more than the average so you have all
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
these available studies the previous
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
study that was done uh by the that was
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
sanctioned as similar to the study
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
that's coming up um at the end of this
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
year which is another study this has
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
been this has been the previous attempts
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
at this were bill 228 and 161 both of
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
them had suffered the same fate this
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
repeating the same thing over and over
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
again expecting a different result is
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
kind of that definition of crazy
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
but in this case we have actually but
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's been identified that we are the
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
third highest amount pay a thousand
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
dollars more but what's really happening
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
is all those funds go to one household
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
so we talk about the higher earner
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
versus the lower earner and our ability
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
to parent effectively we all agree that
 
01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.070 align:start position:0%
to parent effectively we all agree that
50

01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
50
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
50 is the way to to establish parenting
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
time but what happens is all of the
 
01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:05.990 align:start position:0%
time but what happens is all of the
funds

01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
go to the lower earning parent that
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
means that any decisions and all these
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
decisions that came in here which 431
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
proposes to turn over to the judge are
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
already burning courts i have to go to
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
court on a regular basis to try and
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
advocate for my family for my two
 
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
daughters but what it would do is take
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
everything that we talk about that
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
currently are decided by the lower
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
parent our current guidelines 431 would
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
do the same
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
all the decisions of how that those
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
funds are spent could be brought into
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
court so anytime there's a disagreement
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
there were some interesting testimony by
 
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
jay markle who's i think uh well known
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
to this this
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
group as well it talked about
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
it says it right here vacations uh
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
entertainment electronics everything
 
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
that would be subject to the courts so
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
that means every time there's a
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
disagreement it can be brought into
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
court we keep talking about mediation
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's for
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
certain few people that can actually
 
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
qualify to go to mediation that they're
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
already in agreement
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
if people are getting divorced and
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
they're separated and their families are
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
split there's usually more disagreement
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
than agreement so in most cases they are
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
going to court and this would actually
 
01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.510 align:start position:0%
going to court and this would actually
allow

01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
anytime there's a disagreement a
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
disparity between two households you
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
could take that to court the higher or
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
the lower i jokingly say in my testimony
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
that qualified as popcorn if one family
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
gets popcorn one parrot pays for popcorn
 
01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
the other parent has to pay for popcorn
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
is there butter on it is there a
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
goldfish at one house the other house
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
qualifies for that that's entertainment
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
television everything falls into this
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
but that's what this would do
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's intended to provide relief i think
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
we all agree that any of these laws that
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
are being considered are intended to
 
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
provide relief to the current issue of
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
silva v silva because of the strict
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
language that all judges have to follow
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
not mediators judges and everything that
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
431 would end up in court
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
so what 431 it proposes those people
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
between 50 percent and 60
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
that means that
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
the higher versus the low winner has to
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
be within that 50 percent
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
bracket that 10
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
of the actual amount of cases going
 
01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:08.870 align:start position:0%
of the actual amount of cases going
through

01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
what that means is
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
if you're already you have to be that 50
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
to be the higher earner we all agree 50
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
versus 50 you have to be 51 percent and
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
that only goes up to 60
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
if you go through and you look at my
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
calculations and i want to be very clear
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
about what tony machamolo from the
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
mediation group from the working group
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
had proposed
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
actually don't show
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
after taxes
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
i have to pay the funds and most higher
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
earners have to pay
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
after taxes
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
then what the his calculations do not
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
show as well and i have these his
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
calculations right here is that the
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
lower earner is paying does not have to
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
pay taxes on what is received so any of
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
these calculations provide a
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
very biased uh
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
assessment of of current guidelines so
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
the relief would only be provided up to
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
60 percent what do we really have
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
disparity and where this kind of the the
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
problem is for most parents is that the
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
higher earner can't make any decisions
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
can't make any decisions just to the use
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
of those funds there is no agreement
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
that's why they're in court in the first
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
place judges have to follow sylvie silva
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
it has not been changed there's been no
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
lower court it is still precedent for
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
all all parents so a couple quick points
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
and i'd love to answer some questions
 
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
is that the subjective nature i think
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
everyone agrees we want bumpers that was
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
an analogy that was used by two of the
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
folks that spoke before me we're looking
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
for guidelines
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
something that we can all hang our hat
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
on that judges can hang their hat on
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
what 431 would do would make it the wild
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
west every time there is a dis
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
disagreement on the disparity between
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
households it would allow that to be
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
heard in court per this law
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
it allows
 
01:25:50.719 --> 01:25:51.430 align:start position:0%
it allows
the

01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.310 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
lower earner
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
the same thing that we have now they
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
will have all the funds there's no
 
01:25:58.709 --> 01:25:58.719 align:start position:0%
relief to sylvie silva and it actually
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
worsens it i want to make a very good
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
point about this because this is what
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
was discussed before
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
and then this is on um
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
section 9
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 9
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
and i want to be very clear about this
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
because this is law and this is what
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
people reference laws not mediation
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
groups not agreements not conjecture and
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
and happy feelings that people want to
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
talk about we are dealing with a real
 
01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.510 align:start position:0%
talk about we are dealing with a real
reality

01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
reality
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
and this is what's so important if the
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
net difference
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
method does not meet rsa458 c colon five
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
dash lowercase a roman numeral two
 
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
criteria the court may order the child
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
support guidelines amount or
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
another amount that does meet the
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
criteria at rsa450 458 c colon five what
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
that means is that it allows the the
 
01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
judge it allows the courts to be raising
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
our children it does not allow the
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
parents to make any decisions i cannot
 
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
and any parent the higher earner sense
 
01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:56.790 align:start position:0%
and any parent the higher earner sense
this

01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
is in a dis
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
indigent state there's no ability for me
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
to allocate funds for for secondary
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
education for savings
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
all of the funds and this is the reality
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
not conjecture go to the lowering parent
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
what 458c would do
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
is make everything
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
subject to that subjective it allows the
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
judge and again has to go to court our
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
court's already overburdened they're
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
already overwhelmed with these things
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
these cases go on and on and in my case
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
in particular it it which is very
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
relevant to this
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
every one of my orders says silva v
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
silva because of silverbee silva
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
there is no relief no judge has the
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
ability doesn't have the the tools they
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
don't have the tools to do the right
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
thing they have to follow it yes if it's
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
a mediation if people are fortunate
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
enough to qualify for mediation but what
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
458c would do is turn everything into
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
conjecture subjective and it i think the
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
worst part about this
 
01:27:59.110 --> 01:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
is that everyone stating that 50 50
 
01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
parenting time is equal but they're not
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
willing to let that be the case with
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
with the parents and i want to be very
 
01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.030 align:start position:0%
with the parents and i want to be very
clear

01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
in the current silverbee silva and what
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
458c would propose
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
is that the higher earner ends up with
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
inadequate amount of funds and i know it
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
sounds bizarre and i share my
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
calculations with you there as well
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
the higher earner cannot pay for
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
anything has no funds left
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
parents living in in the fire barn
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
because they're they're firemen and they
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
have to pay all their funds the higher
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
having to children that have to live in
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
their vehicles with them it is happening
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
because the higher owner has no funds i
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to be clear about this it
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
actually promotes
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
the lower earner from not having to work
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
it promotes
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
division of families because the lower
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
earner with every lawyer and everyone as
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
we are all discussing right now is very
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
aware of silva v silva it'll it promotes
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
the lower earner to actually say well i
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
can do my calculations and this is what
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
i'll be funds will be available to me it
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
actually promotes
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
this union of families and there's a lot
 
01:29:09.189 --> 01:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
of talk and mention of you know
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
the abusers that are there are are using
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
these funds to somehow control the the
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
lower earner uh i want to be very clear
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
a parenting plan is established in
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
advance of any uso uniform support order
 
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
that comes from the judge the parenting
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
plan is based on the two affidavits the
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
parenting plan whether the parenting
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
time is established far in advance and
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
separately from the actual
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
uniform support order which is the
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
financial amount that's ordered by by
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
the court that's done in advance they do
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
not relate they do not intertwine
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
there's no way for one to
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
it affect the other but what really is
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
is happening it's in what i had handed
 
01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:50.709 align:start position:0%
is happening it's in what i had handed
out

01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
is we pay the third highest amount there
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
was mention of title 4d
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh people say that this somehow will
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
affect the lower earner what
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
there's other laws as we all know that
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
are being considered this time
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
none of them would actually reduce the
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
amount of funds paid they would actually
 
01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:08.709 align:start position:0%
amount of funds paid they would actually
just

01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
change how they are allocated and
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
currently i think we all agree
 
01:30:12.639 --> 01:30:13.590 align:start position:0%
currently i think we all agree
that

01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
funds due to silvery silva go to the
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
lower earner that's the law that is what
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with and i just want to
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
add the last thing is that if you read
 
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
through these things and i just want to
 
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
hit some of the highlights of them
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
because this is where the kind of
 
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
and i'll say it absurdity of this this
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
431 comes into
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
if you read vacation summer care
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
extracurricular activities
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
travel entertainment vacations and
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
people can translate vacations however
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
they like and the question was asked
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
february vacations summer vacations if
 
01:30:46.629 --> 01:30:46.639 align:start position:0%
one family does go to winnipesaukee the
 
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
other family per 458c and it's very
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
clear can actually pursue the same thing
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
in that disparity and then it all comes
 
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
down to roman numeral nine the court may
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
order child support guidelines amount or
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
another amount so this again everything
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
goes back to court the other laws that
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
are out there or legislation that's
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
being proposed actually provides solid
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
guidelines that the judge
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
that all participants can follow it
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it this kind of wild west
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
that that 458 with its good intentions
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
still still does so and i wanted to
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
mention something you know when the the
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
working group came up with this there
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
was a question as to why it didn't
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
follow the car seat study why it didn't
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
fall the national averages and also why
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
didn't why weren't you know parents
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to participate uh there's a bill
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
woodbury who's from the new hampshire
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
bar association he's on the on the the
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
parent working group but i had asked all
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
the individuals in advance of this
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
outcome to participate and i was not
 
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
even responded to
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
and it's kind of a bizarre closed
 
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know creation that was
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
devised by people that are not really
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
living this day to day the mediator
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't see what really goes on in court
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh some of the the the discussion was
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
based on things that were from the 80s
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
not from what we're dealing with today
 
01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:04.070 align:start position:0%
not from what we're dealing with today
so

01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
i appreciate everyone hearing me out and
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
it's obviously a very sensitive subject
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
because many parents higher earners
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
mothers and fathers are are living this
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
every day so thank you for your time are
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative ocala thank you um and
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for mentioning the parenting
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
time because that was the question that
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
i forgot that the the parenting time is
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
actually decided elsewhere and has um
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
and so my question is um
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
does the
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the um
 
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
that the money
 
01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.110 align:start position:0%
that the money
um

01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
aspect should
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
flow directly from
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
what um
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
the parenting
 
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
time was decided to be in the best
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
interest of the child so the money
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
required to be able to support that
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
parenting time should uh
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
flow directly from that that uh decision
 
01:32:58.639 --> 01:32:59.750 align:start position:0%
flow directly from that that uh decision
so

01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
the the problem with current guidelines
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
for f8c equal or approximately equal
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
parenting time is not grounds for
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
deviation by itself so
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
if there is 50 50 parenting time which
 
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
everyone agrees is the norm yes that
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
should so currently 100 of all funds
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
available go to the lower earner
 
01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
of course if they're with me 50 of time
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
the time i'm going to have those
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
expenses and everyone's right when you
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
have two different households that's
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
there are more expenses than just having
 
01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
the one the sum of the parts is greater
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
than the than the thing itself so
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
yes i do
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
um can i follow up or kind of a nuke um
 
01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:41.910 align:start position:0%
um can i follow up or kind of a nuke um
um

01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
the discussion uh regarding these
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
variable expenses
 
01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.430 align:start position:0%
variable expenses
um

01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
it is your understanding in the reading
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
of this that um you know
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
if people do not agree
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
ahead of time on what these who should
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
be paying for these variable expenses
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
and you may be able to go to court and
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
argue that you need a deviation from the
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
normal guidelines because
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
the of you know whatever these variable
 
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
expenses are um
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
not covered under the normal uh
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
the normal guidelines that is correct so
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
this would solidify turn silva v silva
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
into law and what that does is still
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
only for the 50 to 60 would provide
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
relief for anyone that's over
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
um that 50 60 50 to 60
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
area anyone that's only 10
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
so everyone else would actually be still
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
have the lower earner receiving all the
 
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
funds available and in addition to that
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
the lower earner could then go and say
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
well uh popcorn vacations flat-screen tv
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
in one home
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses car insurance things
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
that are supposed to be the parent's
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
decision not the court's decision and
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
again agreement if there is disagreement
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
people have different parenting styles
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
people have different uh ways they like
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
to raise their children not allowing
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
them to have devices not allowing them
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
to watch tv all day
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
none of that would be allowed with with
 
01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
431 it would turn all of that over the
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
courts the courts would be parenting
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
our children because everyone would go
 
01:35:21.109 --> 01:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
to the courts immediately they could say
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
entertainment electronics a television
 
01:35:26.229 --> 01:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
those things are all conjecture
 
01:35:26.239 --> 01:35:27.669 align:start position:0%
those things are all conjecture
subjective

01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
we're looking for something that
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
actually provides real guidelines that
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
puts us in line with the rest of the
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
federal standards that puts us in line
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
agreed to which is 50
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
parenting time is best for children this
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
would this would turn into the wild west
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
and it would
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
further send and i say it in my my
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
these children are in the abyss right
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
now and parents have to spend all their
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
time if they have any or have any money
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
available to to keep advocating for
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
their children because this is about the
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
children not about some money factor but
 
01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
in most of these cases the higher has no
 
01:36:05.669 --> 01:36:05.679 align:start position:0%
funds available so thank you
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%

and keeping people waiting
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
secondly not to embarrass anyone or
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
anything but if i could ask miss sanchez
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%

01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
committee i saw her come in
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
miss sanchez is going to be
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%

01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%

oh and by the way the new bill that was
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
handed out for 458 that was because
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
there was no fiscal note attached to the
 
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
other one so this one they
 
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
they wanted they wanted to put in the
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
significant impact
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%

458
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
when we passed the budget
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
last year house bill 2 there was a
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
section of that that created a study
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee to talk about the closure of
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
the cindernew center and there were five
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
people appointed to that two members of
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
this committee uh including myself
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
and i i chaired that committee
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
what you have before you today
 
01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh is not what came out
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
of of that thing and that's why i'm
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
testifying in support because i know
 
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
something has to be done but with
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
reservations because what we ended up
 
01:38:10.159 --> 01:38:11.109 align:start position:0%
reservations because what we ended up
coming

01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
out with is an initial report um
 
01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
what was changed in in the senate with
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment that you have
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
before you
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh there were three primary things that
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
we were directed through through house
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
bill two number one is that
 
01:38:28.719 --> 01:38:30.229 align:start position:0%
bill two number one is that
uh

01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
we're looking looking for
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
a residential type field that was the
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
that was the
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
um feedback that came back from those
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
people that appeared before the study
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
committee they wanted a residential feel
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
inside and outside
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
not an institutional look
 
01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:48.790 align:start position:0%
not an institutional look
secondly

01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
that the closure date was march
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
was march 1st 2023
 
01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:56.830 align:start position:0%
was march 1st 2023
aggressive

01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
aggressive
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
yes but you know i think the majority of
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
us felt that it would it was doable and
 
01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
it put out an incentive
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
there to
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
not let the thing
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
be delayed
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh and third thirdly the the size of the
 
01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:13.669 align:start position:0%
uh and third thirdly the the size of the
facility

01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
i needed to
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
accommodate 18 beds and that's because
 
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
not because you were going to have 18
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
people there but
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
because they need to be separated by
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
agenda they needed to be second rated by
 
01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:28.709 align:start position:0%
agenda they needed to be second rated by
needs

01:39:28.709 --> 01:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:39:28.719 --> 01:39:30.310 align:start position:0%
needs
and

01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
and others so it was just necessary to
 
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
have that that
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
type of accommodation
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh i have sent a link to each of your
 
01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.590 align:start position:0%
uh i have sent a link to each of your
email

01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
email
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
that will give you the the information
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
study committee report including the
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
final one i will say that there's quite
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
a lot there so
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
you can use up your weekend uh on that
 
01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:57.590 align:start position:0%
you can use up your weekend uh on that
uh

01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
so there in the in the interim since
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
then uh they've come in with a new
 
01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:06.629 align:start position:0%
then uh they've come in with a new
amendment

01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:40:06.639 --> 01:40:07.590 align:start position:0%
amendment
which

01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
proposes building a
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
a new facility on yet
 
01:40:13.199 --> 01:40:14.070 align:start position:0%
a new facility on yet
uh

01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
undesignated state land
 
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh there's been talk about making the
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
facility smaller than 18.
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh beds
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
there's also been a lot of talk about
 
01:40:26.159 --> 01:40:28.070 align:start position:0%
there's also been a lot of talk about
how

01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
using residential
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm talking more private residential
 
01:40:33.679 --> 01:40:34.709 align:start position:0%
and i'm talking more private residential
because

01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
i think we figured with the march date
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
you didn't have time to build a new
 
01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:41.590 align:start position:0%
you didn't have time to build a new
facility

01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
so taking what was existing out there
 
01:40:44.159 --> 01:40:44.950 align:start position:0%
so taking what was existing out there
now

01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:40:47.590 --> 01:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh and accommodating
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of feedback about how
 
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of abuse happens
 
01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:55.750 align:start position:0%
a lot of abuse happens
in

01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:56.790 align:start position:0%
in
private

01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:40:59.430 --> 01:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh residential um
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
i guess i would counter that by saying
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
we have a hundred million dollars worth
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
of suits and counting
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
that came out of sununu
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
and that was under state control
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that kind of raises
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
raises a question in my mind is that are
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
we giving hhs so much responsibility
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
and we know that they have loads of of
 
01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:23.750 align:start position:0%
and we know that they have loads of of
people

01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh vacant positions are we putting so
 
01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
much on that department that they
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
haven't got the ability to oversee
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh the things that need to be done such
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
that these things are happening
 
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh and maybe
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
going within the direction of a private
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
it allows you have personnel to take
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
care of that still going to be on the
 
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
hhs oversight you know we want we want
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
to control so they're going to have to
 
01:41:53.189 --> 01:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
control uh uh if they want to contract
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
with us they're going to have to go
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
according to the contract that's set up
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
you hear about non-disclosure
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
acts there's no reason why something
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
like that can't be built into a contract
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
when you're you're contracting with a
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
private concern that they know
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
if the state comes in and says we want
 
01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:14.719 align:start position:0%
to inspected this we want to investigate
 
01:42:14.719 --> 01:42:16.709 align:start position:0%
to inspected this we want to investigate
this

01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a done deal they can't back
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
out of it now i'll
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
get toward closing to say that
 
01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
hhs contracts all the time
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
with private
 
01:42:29.199 --> 01:42:30.470 align:start position:0%
with private
concerns

01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
i mean many many many programs because
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
we don't do it all as a state we go out
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
and we take those organizations and
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
those agencies that can do that and they
 
01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
specialize in that and so this is not
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
setting anything precedence
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
by by going
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
going in this direction
 
01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:49.910 align:start position:0%
going in this direction
um

01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
we do believe that
 
01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.149 align:start position:0%
we do believe that
uh

01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
we ought to be uh getting out of sununu
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible
 
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
and that's why you know i i tend to
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh prefer the march first date i know
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
that there was some consternation in
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
there because we said that uh if the uh
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
facility isn't built and ready to take
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
the the youth by
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh march first that uh
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh had said the original one had said we
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
would put them out of state i would have
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
no objection if you wanted to leave them
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
at sununu until it's done but i mean the
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
the way that this was amended in the
 
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
senate uh it now actually
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
allows you to drag it out another two
 
01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:38.390 align:start position:0%
allows you to drag it out another two
years

01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
and i i think that's just way way too
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
long uh hhs has a program that they're
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
ready to put in
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
in place and the sooner we can get that
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
going i think the better it is for all
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
of us
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the senator
 
01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
for being here and thank you for your
 
01:44:04.229 --> 01:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
testimony just to clarify
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
having been on the commission
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
what were the three recommendations that
 
01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
came out of that commission
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh three three recommendations were one
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
of them to use the uh the private
 
01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:15.830 align:start position:0%
of them to use the uh the private
residential

01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
residential
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
secondly to build a new facility
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere on state land which would
 
01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
require at least 10 acres and thirdly to
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted that
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
clarification representative yokela
 
01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:37.830 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
um so you you said you supported it with
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
reservations and it seemed from your
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
testimony that your major observation is
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
that they could drag it out for two
 
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
years is that correct my understanding
 
01:44:50.229 --> 01:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
or is there is there more things that
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
you um
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
are concerned about in the current
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
language that's one of the reservations
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
the the other reservations i i have are
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we need to spend the
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
money to build a new facility i mean the
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
senate did did take out the 15 million
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
dollar appropriation on that because
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
frankly we we ran out of time and didn't
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
didn't have the time to to come to a
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
final conclusion on doing doing that um
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
but thirdly i think some some um
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
investigation needs to to
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
be had to determine whether or not
 
01:45:27.679 --> 01:45:29.430 align:start position:0%
be had to determine whether or not
uh

01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
this should be something that is
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
directly overseen
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
by hhs uh with
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
the track record we had with sununu and
 
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
um make sure we don't overload
 
01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:43.189 align:start position:0%
um make sure we don't overload
our

01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
staff and the um
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to to access
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh other private concerns that
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
that do these things all the time so i
 
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
think there are other options that that
 
01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
are out there rather than go in the
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank

01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:14.719 align:start position:0%
fantastic so the um bill if i could just
 
01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:16.639 align:start position:0%
give a very high level less than a
 
01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
minute or two walk through the
 
01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
legislation because i did work with the
 
01:47:23.109 --> 01:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
senate leadership as well as well as uh
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
mr director ripson on the drafting of
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
the legislation um that section one uh
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
does articulate the building of the new
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
secured facility i do understand
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
starting on page one between lines three
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
and five that we certainly want to honor
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
the perspective of the sponsors for the
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
bill particularly around serving the 12
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
youths that is the goal and the
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
objective and i would um do have
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
language prepared that i believe
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
represent rice has been provided to you
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
if there's not enough time because of
 
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
you having to get this bill
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
completed before the 14th the deadline
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
for second committee bills certainly
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
would continue working with you moving
 
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
forward as well on making those
 
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
adjustments it has to be out of
 
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
committee today because we didn't plan
 
01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:10.709 align:start position:0%
committee today because we didn't plan
on

01:48:10.709 --> 01:48:10.719 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
right because it has to be done before
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
next week
 
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%

um the key components here on the
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
amendment is to identify the the goal
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
here is to serve an average of 12 youths
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
at the facility we do need as senator

01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
flexibility to be able to
 
01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:54.870 align:start position:0%
flexibility to be able to
appropriately

01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
separate the children on occasion
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
by gender age excuse me one second can
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
everybody please silence their phones i
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
keep hearing phones going up and it's
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
just very disrespectful to the people
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
you may continue i'm sorry thank you so
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
we would suggest for your consideration
 
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
to substitute in the sentence that is
 
01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:21.350 align:start position:0%
to substitute in the sentence that is
found

01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
found
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh between lines three and five of the
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
bill as it passed by the senate to
 
01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
include the language you'll see that the
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
highlighted language in the draft that
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
was provided to you is the additional
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
language to clarify that we're seeking
 
01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:35.510 align:start position:0%
language to clarify that we're seeking
to

01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
serve an average of 12 youth uh striking
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
the word 18 beds continuing on with an
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
additional sentence that you'll see that
 
01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
says in order to accommodate for the
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
individual needs of youth including
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
gender diverse diverse clinical needs
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
emergency separation of youth for safety
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
and security and the opportunity to
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
provide space for crisis stabilization
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
the physical layout may not may have no
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
more than 18 private
 
01:50:03.589 --> 01:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
sleeping rooms for youth and we do think
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
that that clarifies and honors
 
01:50:06.159 --> 01:50:07.430 align:start position:0%
that that clarifies and honors
the

01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
concern regarding
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
the use of singularly of the 18 beds and
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
again that's for your consideration and
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
can certainly address questions
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
regarding this section before moving on
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
to other sections or i can keep moving
 
01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
along does anybody have a question
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
representative desimone
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman's part right uh
 
01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.109 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman's part right uh
yeah

01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
on the amendment
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
um i agree so far but underneath uh the
 
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
bolded type it says that the department
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
shall consult with any prospective
 
01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
community about the location and
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
operation of any new 18 bed facility
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
should that be changed to 12.
 
01:50:52.639 --> 01:50:53.669 align:start position:0%
should that be changed to 12.
and

01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
that actually is in the bills that came
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
over from the senate um i believe that
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
our goal here is to pre to preface and
 
01:51:03.589 --> 01:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
the very introductory section here that
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
everything following that for any
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
reference to 18 has to acknowledge the
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
fact that the it's to serve 12 children
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
the 18 beds is just to allow the
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility to serving those 12 children
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%

so i will address
 
01:51:31.199 --> 01:51:32.149 align:start position:0%
so i will address
that

01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:32.159 --> 01:51:33.189 align:start position:0%
that
uh

01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
um to representative december's point
 
01:51:36.870 --> 01:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
the department shall consult with any
 
01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
prospective community about the location
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
operation of a new 18 bed facility
 
01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:44.550 align:start position:0%
operation of a new 18 bed facility
um

01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
it brings me
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
to my point if and and i will pref i'm
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
just prefacing with the question
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
if are we we're consulting
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
a a town or community if they're okay
 
01:51:57.679 --> 01:51:58.390 align:start position:0%
a a town or community if they're okay
with

01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
an 18 bed facility coming into their
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
backyard i can name
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
what do we have 200 and some odd towns
 
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
that will say you know
 
01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
would you agree that you find that to be
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
appears john is looking to me um i think
 
01:52:18.629 --> 01:52:18.639 align:start position:0%
the way it's drafted is that we will do
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
our best to work with communities
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
however for state facilities on state
 
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
land it's not the same zoning process so
 
01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
while we'll collaborate i don't think
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
that automatically means that
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
each community is going to be able to
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
say no and we will be left without a
 
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
place to site the facility similar to
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
the way it's working with acquiring
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
hampstead hospital we're very much
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
working with hampstead
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
on that transition but
 
01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
it will still be a state facility within
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:48.790 --> 01:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
are there any for further questions on
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
do you have a question i okay yep
 
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400 align:start position:0%

01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
right this is not an amendment yet i'm
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%

us as you can see section one of the
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
bill set up as chapter laws and it has
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
individual roman paragraphs so we've now
 
01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%

01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
obligation and shall issue a procurement
 
01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
for a qualified design built architect
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
on or before august 1st of this year
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
and the following sentence identifies
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
that we are looking to as part of that
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
to complete the project on or before
 
01:53:43.990 --> 01:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
june 30th of 2024. under existing laws
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
we know um under hb2 the date for
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
standing up the facility is march of
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
2023 we do know the realities of
 
01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
building and having to do this
 
01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
appropriately and doing it the right way
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
that the bill is coming before you for
 
01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
your consideration to setting up a
 
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
design to allowing us to be successful
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
not only in setting up the facilities
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
but as you'll see in the next sections
 
01:54:08.229 --> 01:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
to identify the correct approach in
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
terms of not only building design but
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
also the programs and staffing for those
 
01:54:14.070 --> 01:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
facilities so that quickly takes me
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
through paragraphs um three of the bill
 
01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
which sets forth the design requirements
 
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
for the building uh representation
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
simone to your point there is another
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
reference to the 18 beds in here however
 
01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
with this amendment that would cover us
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
because it comes before explaining
 
01:54:29.199 --> 01:54:30.310 align:start position:0%
because it comes before explaining
exactly

01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
why the 18 beds are there not to fill
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
them but to give flexibility
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
moving along to section uh four of the
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
build these are the program programming
 
01:54:41.109 --> 01:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
operations and this is really critical
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
and i think the uh advocates that you'll
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
hear testifying in support of this bill
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
are going to identify that these are
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
components that are really necessary to
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
appropriately address the youths that
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
are going to be receiving services
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
through the facilities you have the
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
staffing qualification standards you
 
01:54:57.510 --> 01:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
have evidence-based
 
01:54:59.430 --> 01:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
practices utilization of uniform
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
assessments provision of care management
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
visitation opportunities for family
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
members educational programming and
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
staffing integration of clinical
 
01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
assessments and to our new child
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
advocate who is here with us real-time
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
access by the office of child advocate
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
section uh roman five of the bill uh
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
talks about standing up at least the
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
first two provisions of these programs
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
so that there would be a seamless
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
transition between the existing facility
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
which is being closed on march 31st uh
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
rather march first of 2023 and then the
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
standing up and opening of the facility
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
which is slated for june of 2023
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
currently so um and as set forth in this
 
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
bill so the department also has
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
quarterly reporting requirements and i
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
will say senator rosenwald had a very
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
good hand in making sure that she
 
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
identified certain particular factors
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
that she needed to have wanted to have
 
01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
the legislature you and the house also
 
01:55:59.669 --> 01:55:59.679 align:start position:0%
reported on and you'll see going to page
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
three of the bill
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
that there's outlined um subparagraphs a
 
01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:05.270 align:start position:0%
that there's outlined um subparagraphs a
through

01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
e that give very detailed data-driven
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
information in terms of the progress for
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
standing up the new facility
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
paragraph number seven would give the
 
01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
governor the authority to go to fiscal
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
committee of the joint fiscal committee
 
01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
for both the senate and the house
 
01:56:28.149 --> 01:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
members to seeking as needed um a um if
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances unforeseen were to arise
 
01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to come back before the
 
01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
legislature without having to file a
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
bill like this again to go back for your
 
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
body to move forward on on the
 
01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
construction if there is a need to um to
 
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
extending the time for building um the
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
thoughtful approach here and i have to
 
01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
give credit to senator bradley is that
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
it it does prevent us from every every
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
year having to come back here before you
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
on a bill if there is a need to making
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
certain adjustments based upon materials
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
based upon location of facilities based
 
01:56:59.910 --> 01:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
upon as representative blanchard pointed
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
out citing um
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
specifications and communities that
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
there there could be unforeseen but
 
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
we'll make best efforts to accommodate
 
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
um these requests which brings me to the
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
the to to accommodate this request you
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
have to have an appropriation so if i
 
01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
could direct your attention to page 3
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
line 21 you'll see at the very end of
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
that first sentence on that line it says
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
the sum of one dollar if you could add a
 
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
five followed by a comma and six zeros
 
01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
that would be particularly helpful
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's 50 million dollars um as senator
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
daniels pointed out it wasn't the
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
senate's position to tag the department
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
with one dollar they knew this was going
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
to cost something they just needed the
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
additional time to allow the process to
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
work out through the house to
 
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
identifying what that
 
01:57:45.669 --> 01:57:45.679 align:start position:0%
amount should be as you'll see from the
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal note attached to the bill it's
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
based upon the commission that was
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
established in hb2 for the closure
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
of this new new center and on page 126
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
of that report you'll see that the
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
through uh commissioner arlinghaus
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
identified at that time while looking at
 
01:58:03.599 --> 01:58:04.390 align:start position:0%
identified at that time while looking at
this

01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
the bricks and mortars piece of this was
 
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
estimated at 15 million dollars so
 
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's where that amount of money was
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
derived from and you could certainly
 
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
reference back to that report on page
 
01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:16.310 align:start position:0%
reference back to that report on page
126.

01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
126.
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
except yes
 
01:58:20.229 --> 01:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
up 15 million if i spoke higher than
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
that that's only because we had
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
delusional wishes in the department for
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars but i think i
 
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully said 15 1 5
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
followed by six zeros
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
um you'll see on section uh four of the
 
01:58:34.709 --> 01:58:34.719 align:start position:0%
bill talking about a repeal those are
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
specific sections in hb2 with timing for
 
01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
standing up the facility obviously those
 
01:58:41.189 --> 01:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
need to be taken care of you don't want
 
01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
two laws on the same with different
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
dates so those would repeal the
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
provisions in hp2 for the standing up at
 
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
the facility on march of 2023 and then
 
01:58:52.470 --> 01:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
the effective day after passage i hope
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
that was a meaningful walkthrough of the
 
01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
legislation to give you a full depth of
 
01:58:57.270 --> 01:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
understanding of what was accomplished
 
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
in the senate i think they did a
 
01:59:00.629 --> 01:59:00.639 align:start position:0%
wonderful job with the bill and we are
 
01:59:02.229 --> 01:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
here certainly to address questions but
 
01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
before i do that i want to ask uh um um
 
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
director attorney ross if she has
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
anything to offer
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
um i don't i'm happy to take any
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
questions and help explain how this
 
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
integrates in with the children's system
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
of care that we've been working on as
 
01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:16.390 align:start position:0%
of care that we've been working on as
well

01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay so before i call on people to take
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
questions i'm gonna take a little
 
01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
privilege here and say that i think that
 
01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
if you're a co-sponsor of a bill and
 
01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's gutted in the senate you should be
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
able to ask a ton of questions
 
01:59:30.149 --> 01:59:30.159 align:start position:0%
so i need to figure out how we're going
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
to fix that because i have a ton of
 
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
questions that i can't ask
 
01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:37.109 align:start position:0%
questions that i can't ask
so

01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
the people that can ask questions
 
01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative grossman
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
go right ahead
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you both
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
for coming before us today
 
01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
i have one question related to what
 
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
happens to the youth
 
01:59:56.070 --> 01:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
on march of 2023
 
01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:56.870 align:start position:0%
on march of 2023
so

01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
the facility is closing
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
but the new facility is not ready yet
 
02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
right so where are the youth that are in
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
the sununu center going in that interim
 
02:00:08.719 --> 02:00:12.550 align:start position:0%
the sununu center going in that interim
period

02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
having not been involved in the last
 
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
couple conversations we would have to
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are in a secured
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
setting um during that transition period
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's required by their court orders and
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
their detention or commitment status and
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
we would need a seamless transition that
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
they are not left without a place and
 
02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
without supervision during that period
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative yokela
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
question um
 
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's hb uh 254 we're changing
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
what um
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
people can be committed um if
 
02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:53.109 align:start position:0%
people can be committed um if
uh

02:00:53.109 --> 02:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679 align:start position:0%
if that law went into effect
 
02:00:55.679 --> 02:00:56.629 align:start position:0%
if that law went into effect
um

02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
what would be the current population of
 
02:01:02.070 --> 02:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
committed individuals
 
02:01:03.270 --> 02:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
we don't believe that that will have a
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
substantial impact there are absent
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
flows through the population throughout
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
the year and at any given time we don't
 
02:01:10.470 --> 02:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
we don't think it will have a
 
02:01:13.589 --> 02:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
substantial impact um and so we would
 
02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
still need to be able to ensure that at
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
the highest level of of need we're able
 
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
to meet the capacity requirements
 
02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:22.629 align:start position:0%
to meet the capacity requirements
follow-up

02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:22.639 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's actually a different question but
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
my my um
 
02:01:29.790 --> 02:01:29.800 align:start position:0%
the question the um on page 3 line
 
02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
12-14 it says the governor with the
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
approval of the fiscal committee
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
can extend the deadline if the fiscal
 
02:01:38.950 --> 02:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
committee says no
 
02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
and says we want the sununu center
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
closed asap
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
um what would the department do
 
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
um i think we'd be working very closely
 
02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general's office and
 
02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
going to court in every single case
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
where a judge has ordered that an
 
02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
individual be securely
 
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
confined and either looking to move them
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
out of state or find an alternative plan
 
02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
but it it would create a substantial
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
crisis for those youth that are not
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
ready to transition out
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
taking the questions uh what the first
 
02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
question is on uh the fir
 
02:02:27.669 --> 02:02:27.679 align:start position:0%
the first page uh
 
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
line 16 says the
 
02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:30.950 align:start position:0%
line 16 says the
the

02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
you'll be completing the project on or
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
before june 30th 2024
 
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
so that's two years from now
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
and then you extend another two years if
 
02:02:49.109 --> 02:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
02:02:53.830 --> 02:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
page three line starting on line twelves
 
02:02:56.070 --> 02:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
unforeseen circumstances provide any
 
02:02:58.950 --> 02:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
such delay be no more than two years
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a potent
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
construction industry in the state of
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:03:06.070 --> 02:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at four years to get this
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
done that's unacceptable to me
 
02:03:08.159 --> 02:03:10.629 align:start position:0%
done that's unacceptable to me
um

02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so i i guess i'd need to address
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
that whenever i said yeah this is what
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
you're agreeing with so
 
02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
um i won't i won't ask uh and
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh just one more if i may show it up to
 
02:03:29.830 --> 02:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
you the uh
 
02:03:33.990 --> 02:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
the implementation of uh starts
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
page two line four all the way down the
 
02:03:38.070 --> 02:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
implementation with with while children
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
remain at the current facility
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
how do you see that how do you see that
 
02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:51.669 align:start position:0%
how do you see that how do you see that
working

02:03:51.669 --> 02:03:51.679 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
i mean it seems like we're we're
 
02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
doing something we've been doing forever
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh then now we're gonna change that
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
um so that when the other facility's
 
02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
ready we move in
 
02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
ready to go is my understanding
 
02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:07.669 align:start position:0%
ready to go is my understanding
um

02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:10.719 align:start position:0%
how does that get done i i believe that
 
02:04:12.069 --> 02:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
the language for standing up the
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
facility for june is on her before that
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
so there would be a seamless transition
 
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
as miss ross had been explained to a
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
previous question that would be our goal
 
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh making sure that the appropriate
 
02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
which which does raise one other
 
02:04:27.750 --> 02:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
question i would want to point out the
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
committee to be fully clear about the
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
cost the 15 million is for construction
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
it does not include the staffing and
 
02:04:35.589 --> 02:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
other resources that are going to be
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
needed that will have to be built into
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
our 2425 budget
 
02:04:40.159 --> 02:04:40.950 align:start position:0%
our 2425 budget
so

02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:42.069 align:start position:0%
so
so

02:04:42.069 --> 02:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:42.079 --> 02:04:42.950 align:start position:0%
so
yeah

02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
you um my question was how you do it you
 
02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
said that was your hopes of doing that
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
that is your goal
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
my question was how do you get that goal
 
02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
i i you know especially where
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
especially where current staff members
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
probably need different qualifications
 
02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking
 
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
so you've gotta
 
02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
you gotta raise that money you gotta go
 
02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
to fiscal to get that money to change
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
from by march of 23. yes and there's
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
already been work on changing the job
 
02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
descriptions for the staff at sysc
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
and changing the operations so that
 
02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's in line to move into a new
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
facility there are a lot of details to
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
be worked out but um
 
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
until we have more than a dollar in an
 
02:05:30.550 --> 02:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
actual plan there's only so much that
 
02:05:32.069 --> 02:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
can be done to make those but the goal
 
02:05:34.550 --> 02:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
would absolutely be to have staff
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
trained and in the new positions and
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
roll into the new facility
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
and look at the lessons learned from
 
02:05:42.149 --> 02:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
moving into the new women's prison and
 
02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
other facilities
 
02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
and work with the team that's moving and
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
building the new psychiatric facility so
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
that we um can get that seamless
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
transition and have everyone in their
 
02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
new rule roles at the time that we
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
transition transition into a new
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative yocala
 
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:06.310 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

02:06:06.310 --> 02:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:09.189 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
when you talk about um changing people's
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
roles um i assume that you're talking
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
about current staff
 
02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
um changing their role because it
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a change unless they were
 
02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
weren't current um so
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
what is the benefit of
 
02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
moving to a different facility
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
if the staffing is the same uh as far as
 
02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
the people or are we reducing the number
 
02:06:36.550 --> 02:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
of people that
 
02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:39.669 align:start position:0%
that um
we

02:06:39.669 --> 02:06:39.679 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:06:42.629 --> 02:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
are going to staff it or increasing
 
02:06:46.950 --> 02:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
is there an actual benefit to moving if
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
you're keeping the same people
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
and yes and
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
represent whereas respectfully the
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
legislature has already drawn that
 
02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
directive to us to close down sununu as
 
02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
part of the hb2 so it's an interesting
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
question but i think it's moot only
 
02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
because we're already under uh state law
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
to close the facility so we do have to
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
do that and we i believe uh resident
 
02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
ocala we will continue to be very
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
thoughtful to make sure that um as it
 
02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
sets forth in on starting on page two on
 
02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
line four on roman four that we have
 
02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate staff and not only
 
02:07:25.750 --> 02:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate staff by standards and
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
qualifications but also the programs
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be providing to the
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
youth that are going to be at that
 
02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:32.629 align:start position:0%
youth that are going to be at that
facility

02:07:32.629 --> 02:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
and to add to that
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
we are looking at the right
 
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
array of staff and in a in a very large
 
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
building that we're in now that's going
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
to look different than in a smaller
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
space that's configured differently we
 
02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
can't completely design that until we
 
02:07:49.109 --> 02:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
know what we're going to be moving into
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
but the a m report that was provided to
 
02:07:54.390 --> 02:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
the committee and used over the summer
 
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
helps lay out and define what the
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate staffing would be
 
02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
to move more toward the system of care
 
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
and providing
 
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
a different clinically based approach as
 
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
compared to where the sysc facility is
 
02:08:11.109 --> 02:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
operating now which has substantially
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
changed in in recent past but is going
 
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
to continue to evolve with the movement
 
02:08:25.109 --> 02:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative belanger
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
again for being here today um as the
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
only legislator who has been a resident
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
of the facility
 
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
i do have a couple of questions
 
02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:38.950 align:start position:0%
i do have a couple of questions
um

02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
you stated that hhs
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
miss ross the hhs has got a lot of
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
projects on their hands right now
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
how is this going to impact those other
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
projects and do you see this being
 
02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
another project on top of the other ones
 
02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
that you're dealing with do you see that
 
02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
being a problem
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
provided we have the staffing and the
 
02:09:00.069 --> 02:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
resources to
 
02:09:02.550 --> 02:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
construct a new facility and train folks
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
to move into it no i think that's that's
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
how we we scale our work and we're able
 
02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
to do it um projects and processes
 
02:09:12.629 --> 02:09:12.639 align:start position:0%
always change that we're used to those
 
02:09:12.639 --> 02:09:14.149 align:start position:0%
always change that we're used to those
adjustments

02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
and um rights if i could just add to
 
02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
that we in addition that's why i pointed
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
out that the 15 million dollars is
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
really a capital budget uh for standing
 
02:09:25.109 --> 02:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
up this
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
facility which is needed and
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh we are thoughtfully working through
 
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
or already part of the development of
 
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
the state agency efficiency phase of the
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
budget so this is certainly a priority
 
02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
for the department and something that
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to be thoughtfully working
 
02:09:40.629 --> 02:09:40.639 align:start position:0%
through in terms of those resources
 
02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up less of a follow-up but an
 
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
additional question sure regarding
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
census so i have three questions
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
regarding census what census today what
 
02:09:51.189 --> 02:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
was census last week and what was census
 
02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:55.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
the last i knew as of
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
at some point last week it was 12 or 13.
 
02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
um i can get you those and follow up as
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
soon as i get back to my phone and and
 
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
make an ask of that
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
but it has been ranging around that 12
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:15.510 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
i do have a follow-up to that question
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
and one more following so
 
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative yokela had alluded to um
 
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
hb 254 and what changes would that
 
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
affect the census just to clarify in
 
02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:29.270 align:start position:0%
affect the census just to clarify in
your

02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
statement you said
 
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
based off of hb 254 and the number of 12
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
youth that are in that facility you do
 
02:10:39.109 --> 02:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
not expect there to be a drastic change
 
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
no not a substantial change that doesn't
 
02:10:42.069 --> 02:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
mean it won't have an impact on
 
02:10:46.229 --> 02:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
individuals throughout their cases but
 
02:10:48.390 --> 02:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
given how far we've reduced the census
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
over the last decade
 
02:10:53.189 --> 02:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
and the things that we can't predict as
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
a result of 254 whether it be that
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
additional youth are prosecuted into the
 
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
adult system who end up spending a
 
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
longer time there during the
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
certification to be prosecuted as an
 
02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
adult during that process
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
we don't know what those impacts will be
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
so we can't we can't predict that there
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
will be less youth there less days based
 
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
on house bill 254
 
02:11:20.069 --> 02:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
and last question madam chair one more
 
02:11:22.830 --> 02:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
um mr
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry this is the first time i'm
 
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
seeing you what was your name again my
 
02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
name is john williams and believe it or
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
not i started in front of this committee
 
02:11:35.189 --> 02:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
back in 1999.
 
02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
i apologize very nice to meet you uh
 
02:11:39.109 --> 02:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
apologies for not getting to that
 
02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
originally uh mr williams so in your
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
estimation the 15 million is expected
 
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
for construction only is that correct
 
02:11:49.109 --> 02:11:49.119 align:start position:0%
that is correct as you'll see identified
 
02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
on page 126 of the commission report
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
just following up madam chair
 
02:11:58.550 --> 02:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
one two six yep um so in the bill itself
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
it states that we will
 
02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
construct a secured treatment facility
 
02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
that is no more than 18 beds and we did
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
talk about the amendment here however as
 
02:12:10.069 --> 02:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
studies continue to show we expect a
 
02:12:12.069 --> 02:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
more home-like environment
 
02:12:14.229 --> 02:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
where is this in this bill where my
 
02:12:15.910 --> 02:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
expectation is that we are supposed to
 
02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
be building a more home environment and
 
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
less of a prison
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me youth detention center big
 
02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:29.350 align:start position:0%
excuse me youth detention center big
difference

02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh deferring to to miss ross because
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
this is more of her world of subject
 
02:12:35.589 --> 02:12:35.599 align:start position:0%
matter but as you see built into the
 
02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
bill and again working with the
 
02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
advocates very thoughtfully because the
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh not only the department but the
 
02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
commit the community that supports
 
02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
children and healthy environments for
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
those children identified as part of the
 
02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
language of the bill in paragraphs
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
three and four
 
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
not only the facility how it was to be
 
02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
constructed but to get into the details
 
02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
of the types of programs and how that
 
02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
would be managed to ensure
 
02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
the to address the concerns that you're
 
02:13:04.149 --> 02:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
raising representative
 
02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you no more further questions
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative altschiller
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:13:14.709 --> 02:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
being here and um
 
02:13:18.629 --> 02:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
i'd like to go to page two
 
02:13:18.639 --> 02:13:19.990 align:start position:0%
i'd like to go to page two
um

02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
um

02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
we um i'd like to know why we are not
 
02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
why we focus in specifically on
 
02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices when some of
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
the newer research coming out is telling
 
02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
us that evidence-based practices have
 
02:13:54.790 --> 02:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
limitations in that they are
 
02:13:56.950 --> 02:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
very unless they unless
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
unless that evidence-based research
 
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
that then results in a practice is done
 
02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:03.990 align:start position:0%
that then results in a practice is done
with

02:14:03.990 --> 02:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
a broad-based application of youth we're
 
02:14:12.629 --> 02:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of this evidence-based
 
02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
research coming through
 
02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:15.910 align:start position:0%
research coming through
highly

02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
highly
 
02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
targeted and
 
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
would it not be
 
02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
in our interest in new hampshire to have
 
02:14:25.109 --> 02:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
evidence-based and research-based
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
practices as part of this rsa to allow
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
for the flexibility
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
for um
 
02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:32.790 align:start position:0%
for um
programming

02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
programming
 
02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
to not be structured in a way that
 
02:14:37.510 --> 02:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
inhibits the growth
 
02:14:40.229 --> 02:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
of those that programming
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely i completely agree that
 
02:14:44.709 --> 02:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
using exclusively evidence-based
 
02:14:48.550 --> 02:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
practices prohibits the expansion of
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
the availability of evidence-based and
 
02:14:52.709 --> 02:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
evidence-supported practices consistent
 
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
with the system of care we we are
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
certainly looking to grow that world of
 
02:14:59.669 --> 02:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
services and make sure
 
02:15:02.069 --> 02:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
that um evidence-based practices are
 
02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
used with fidelity so that you're not
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
using an evidence-based practice with
 
02:15:06.870 --> 02:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
the wrong population to not get the
 
02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
outcomes that you want so looking at
 
02:15:10.709 --> 02:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
evidence supported or researched based
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
in the inclusion of the service array is
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
certainly important as we're growing
 
02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up so if there were to be an
 
02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
all a change in that to use
 
02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
evidence-based and research-based
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
practices would that be something that
 
02:15:25.599 --> 02:15:26.550 align:start position:0%
practices would that be something that
the

02:15:26.550 --> 02:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:28.229 --> 02:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
that would be supported
 
02:15:30.149 --> 02:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
the department would not would support
 
02:15:33.109 --> 02:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
that it's consistent with 135f in the
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
system of care and it would would help
 
02:15:37.910 --> 02:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
support the progress at the facility
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
may follow up follow up
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
above that facility programming and
 
02:15:44.709 --> 02:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
operations part a staff qualifications
 
02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
and standard job descriptions
 
02:15:49.750 --> 02:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
um an emphasis on treatment with you of
 
02:15:52.149 --> 02:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
youth with behavioral health challenges
 
02:15:54.629 --> 02:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
and considerable trauma histories
 
02:15:57.510 --> 02:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
um it says applicable to the facility so
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
i could you explain what that would be
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
because i
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
i do not understand um
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
how that could be
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
is that saying
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
is this another way of saying
 
02:16:12.550 --> 02:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
training that emphasize the treatment of
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
youth with behavioral health challenges
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
who are in the juvenile justice system
 
02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:18.950 align:start position:0%
who are in the juvenile justice system
or

02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
yes and we wouldn't without actually
 
02:16:21.910 --> 02:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
02:16:23.830 --> 02:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
um well this is focusing on the
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
operation of the facility but we want
 
02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
complete integration with the system of
 
02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
care for children so they're getting
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
engaged with the care management entity
 
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
while they're at the facility in order
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
to ensure an appropriate discharge plan
 
02:16:36.549 --> 02:16:36.559 align:start position:0%
and transition into either
 
02:16:38.309 --> 02:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
community-based services or residential
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
care as they're moving out when
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate so we would expect the same
 
02:16:44.309 --> 02:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
cat assessment and cans assessments to
 
02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
be used and to integrate that throughout
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
their service delivery
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
i follow that up so in part c
 
02:16:55.990 --> 02:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
the utilization of the uniform
 
02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:57.750 align:start position:0%
the utilization of the uniform
assessment

02:16:57.750 --> 02:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:16:59.190 --> 02:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
if you could
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
point out for us
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:06.479 --> 02:17:07.589 align:start position:0%
 
where

02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:17:09.509 --> 02:17:09.519 align:start position:0%
our stated goals
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
in doing these reviews
 
02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
was to provide
 
02:17:15.349 --> 02:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
for um
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
was to provide for the children who have
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
experienced every child who is coming
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
into these into our facilities
 
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
have an asus score of seven or higher
 
02:17:26.709 --> 02:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
that's just flat out that's it so how
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
are we addressing their aces scores
 
02:17:31.830 --> 02:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
while also addressing the juvenile
 
02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:32.870 align:start position:0%
while also addressing the juvenile
justice

02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
justice
 
02:17:36.629 --> 02:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
aspect so where is the treatment of
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
coming up out of that
 
02:17:41.589 --> 02:17:41.599 align:start position:0%
simultaneously with the juvenile justice
 
02:17:41.599 --> 02:17:42.469 align:start position:0%
simultaneously with the juvenile justice
aspect

02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
02:17:44.070 --> 02:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
because we have leaned a little too
 
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
heavy in the juvenile justice
 
02:17:51.030 --> 02:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
and um and not addressing those a scores
 
02:17:52.629 --> 02:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
so i think they really are one in the
 
02:17:55.349 --> 02:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
same in order to provide treatment and
 
02:17:55.359 --> 02:17:56.469 align:start position:0%
same in order to provide treatment and
supervision

02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
and ensure a safe and appropriate
 
02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
transition back to the community you
 
02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
have to do that every
 
02:18:02.639 --> 02:18:03.509 align:start position:0%
have to do that every
youth

02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:03.519 align:start position:0%
youth
 
02:18:06.309 --> 02:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
at sysc is now getting the cans
 
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
assessment that the staff down there
 
02:18:09.750 --> 02:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
have been trained that's the same child
 
02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
and adolescent needs and strengths tool
 
02:18:13.509 --> 02:18:13.519 align:start position:0%
that's being used by our community
 
02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
providers in our residential set
 
02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:17.599 align:start position:0%
providers and within our acute
 
02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
psychiatric facilities
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
so every 90 days that strength and needs
 
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
assessment is
 
02:18:25.990 --> 02:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
should be completed that's part of the
 
02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
cat assessment which is looking at level
 
02:18:31.349 --> 02:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
of care for residential um and all being
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
integrated into their short and long
 
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
term goals that are approved by the
 
02:18:37.349 --> 02:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
court system every 90 days through
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:43.349 --> 02:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
are you all sad
 
02:18:45.429 --> 02:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
for now thank you very much yes
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
uh representative lebeck
 
02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um so
 
02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
on page one uh line 27 it talks about
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
the space to meet the educational needs
 
02:19:00.230 --> 02:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
of the youth and
 
02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
youth with special needs with that space
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
include like private areas where they
 
02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
can have tutors or the staff
 
02:19:10.309 --> 02:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
go over like homework and so that way
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
they're in
 
02:19:13.509 --> 02:19:13.519 align:start position:0%
that area and there's no distractions
 
02:19:15.910 --> 02:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
for them because some kids need that
 
02:19:17.669 --> 02:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
extra help
 
02:19:20.070 --> 02:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely currently sysc has a full
 
02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
school with multiple classrooms and a
 
02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
very large space dedicated to that it's
 
02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%
too much for the 12 or so
 
02:19:29.429 --> 02:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
youth that are down there
 
02:19:31.509 --> 02:19:31.519 align:start position:0%
but we didn't want to end up in a
 
02:19:34.469 --> 02:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
home-like setting that didn't have
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
that ability to fully educate so we
 
02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
would expect there to be classroom space
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
tutoring space and the availability to
 
02:19:43.349 --> 02:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
do assessments and meet with educational
 
02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
professionals for every youth that's
 
02:19:44.719 --> 02:19:47.509 align:start position:0%
professionals for every youth that's
there

02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
02:19:51.670 --> 02:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative ocala
 
02:19:53.830 --> 02:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
hi um thank you for taking the question
 
02:19:55.349 --> 02:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
on on
 
02:19:55.359 --> 02:19:56.469 align:start position:0%
on on
uh

02:19:56.469 --> 02:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:59.110 --> 02:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh page two line four
 
02:20:01.830 --> 02:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
it says that um the programming shall
 
02:20:04.150 --> 02:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
include um but it doesn't say it's
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
limited to this list so
 
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
would you be able to use the
 
02:20:10.630 --> 02:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
research-based things now without a
 
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:19.270 --> 02:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
um yes i mean certainly it doesn't say
 
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
use exclusively evidence-based but if
 
02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature wants to call out that
 
02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:25.510 align:start position:0%
the legislature wants to call out that
we

02:20:25.510 --> 02:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
we as a community are going to support
 
02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
the res the research supported practices
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:20:33.910 --> 02:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
that gives the facility and the staff
 
02:20:36.389 --> 02:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
better direction as to the intent of the
 
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature in standing up the new
 
02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:40.870 align:start position:0%
the legislature in standing up the new
facility

02:20:40.870 --> 02:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
are you all set
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative representative belanger
 
02:20:47.910 --> 02:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just really brief
 
02:20:49.510 --> 02:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
going back to my sense this question
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
kind of popped into my head
 
02:20:53.190 --> 02:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
how many are misdemeanors that are
 
02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
detained excuse me that are um excuse
 
02:20:58.389 --> 02:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
whoop okay
 
02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
in regards to the number of 12 youth
 
02:21:03.030 --> 02:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
that are currently at sysc right now
 
02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
how many are misdemeanors how many are
 
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
felonies how many are detained and how
 
02:21:09.670 --> 02:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
many are committed
 
02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean that changes every day we
 
02:21:13.510 --> 02:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
would have to go back and get the list i
 
02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
know we've provided that information
 
02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
before i think what can be deceiving is
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
that currently under the system if law
 
02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the prosecutors know
 
02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
that they can get the outcome
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
high willingness to work with the
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
parties to reach a settlement that they
 
02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
that the youth can
 
02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh be committed to syc or held at sysc
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
and so there there are
 
02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
plea agreements or settlements um for a
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
lesser offense even if you look at the
 
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
underlying facts that may be higher so
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
um even if it says misdemeanor today
 
02:21:48.870 --> 02:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
it could be a felony level behavior or
 
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
conduct that may in a future system
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
in fact be prosecuted as a felony or as
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
an adult felony charge
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
follower just if you we could get that
 
02:22:01.270 --> 02:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
as quickly as you possibly can that
 
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
would be greatly appreciated
 
02:22:05.349 --> 02:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
we will we will ask for that and send it
 
02:22:05.359 --> 02:22:06.469 align:start position:0%
we will we will ask for that and send it
over

02:22:06.469 --> 02:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much and
 
02:22:14.790 --> 02:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you reference rice thank you
 
02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
up next is the honorable neil kirk who
 
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
is in support of the bill is introduced
 
02:22:22.389 --> 02:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
and opposes the bill as amended and he's
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
asked for three minutes good to see you
 
02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:25.429 align:start position:0%
asked for three minutes good to see you
sir

02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
sir
 
02:22:27.030 --> 02:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
good to see you ma'am
 
02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
good uh good afternoon
 
02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:22:32.070 --> 02:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
i'm neil kirk
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
i live in where and i'm representing
 
02:22:36.389 --> 02:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
myself for many years i was a state
 
02:22:38.230 --> 02:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative and served largely on the
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
this committee for at least a decade has
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
treating children in the community and
 
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
not in an institutional facility
 
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
i finally glommed on to that
 
02:22:57.030 --> 02:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
in roughly 2016 when i realized that the
 
02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
population of the sununu center was
 
02:22:58.800 --> 02:22:59.990 align:start position:0%
population of the sununu center was
declining

02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
declining
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
significantly and we were spending a lot
 
02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
of money
 
02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
on a building designed for 144 when in
 
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
fact it was occupied by 60
 
02:23:10.790 --> 02:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
went down to 40 to 20 and now we're at
 
02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:12.389 align:start position:0%
went down to 40 to 20 and now we're at
12.

02:23:12.389 --> 02:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
12.
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
and so there was a confluence of
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
advocates for community treatment for
 
02:23:19.270 --> 02:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
people and those people
 
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
on the budget finance committee were
 
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about paying for this
 
02:23:24.389 --> 02:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
that met
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
and we've been working for years
 
02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
on this project you folks on this
 
02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
committee have been working to have
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
children treated in the community house
 
02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
bill 254 is the latest iteration of that
 
02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
and folks on finance have been trying to
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
figure out how we can reduce the cost
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
one of the problems with having an
 
02:23:46.309 --> 02:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
institution is that you have fixed costs
 
02:23:50.469 --> 02:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
whether they're 144 kids or 12 kids
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
this is an exaggeration
 
02:23:54.710 --> 02:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
the staff is significantly the same for
 
02:23:57.670 --> 02:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
example there are 83 staff members today
 
02:23:59.349 --> 02:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
at sununu
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
under this bill as the senate proposes
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
the 18 bed facility there would be
 
02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
roughly 63
 
02:24:09.910 --> 02:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay a huge number of people for a
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
relatively small number of children
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
right now we're spending a million
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
dollars a year per child
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
in sununu over a million
 
02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:18.870 align:start position:0%
in sununu over a million
so

02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:20.070 align:start position:0%
so
i

02:24:20.070 --> 02:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:21.270 align:start position:0%
i
oppose

02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment that came out of the

senate and support
 
02:24:27.990 --> 02:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced by senator
 
02:24:30.950 --> 02:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
daniels and representative rice
 
02:24:33.429 --> 02:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
the bill that came out of the senate the
 
02:24:35.429 --> 02:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
bill that you have before you
 
02:24:35.439 --> 02:24:36.469 align:start position:0%
bill that you have before you
um

02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:38.230 --> 02:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
repeats history
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
it creates a mini sununu center 18 bed
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
12 bed a mini sununu center operated by
 
02:24:46.550 --> 02:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:24:49.349 --> 02:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
at at least historically on a reform
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
school model rather than a treatment
 
02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:52.230 align:start position:0%
school model rather than a treatment
model

02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
model
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
that certainly was the result and we
 
02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
have seen what has happened
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars in
 
02:25:00.389 --> 02:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
lawsuits as a result of mistreatment of
 
02:25:03.190 --> 02:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
these juveniles and it's unclear whether
 
02:25:05.110 --> 02:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
or not at least to me you folks probably
 
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
would know better whether the treatment
 
02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
the children receive forgetting about
 
02:25:10.389 --> 02:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
the abuse but the treatment they
 
02:25:10.399 --> 02:25:11.429 align:start position:0%
the abuse but the treatment they
received

02:25:11.429 --> 02:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
received
 
02:25:13.349 --> 02:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
really benefited them at the sununu
 
02:25:13.359 --> 02:25:15.510 align:start position:0%
really benefited them at the sununu
center

02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
center
 
02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:18.870 align:start position:0%
center
the

02:25:18.870 --> 02:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
the idea that we would pass the senate
 
02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
bill suggests that we have learned
 
02:25:25.990 --> 02:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
nothing from history and we want history
 
02:25:29.349 --> 02:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:30.870 --> 02:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
do we expect another couple hundred
 
02:25:32.870 --> 02:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars of lawsuits five ten
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
twenty years from now
 
02:25:37.190 --> 02:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's a bad approach it's not
 
02:25:38.389 --> 02:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
child-centered it's not
 
02:25:40.150 --> 02:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
treatment-centered the bill is
 
02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:41.429 align:start position:0%
treatment-centered the bill is
introduced

02:25:41.429 --> 02:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
the daniel's rice bill took a different
 
02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:44.950 align:start position:0%
the daniel's rice bill took a different
approach

02:25:44.950 --> 02:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
approach
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
it said basically we're going to provide
 
02:25:49.750 --> 02:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
treatment in the community
 
02:25:51.750 --> 02:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
in a
 
02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:53.190 align:start position:0%
in a
non-profit

02:25:53.190 --> 02:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
private sector run facility which might
 
02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
if it's done correctly make the children
 
02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
eligible for medicaid cost sharing which
 
02:26:05.190 --> 02:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
is not the case now at the sununu center
 
02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:06.550 align:start position:0%
is not the case now at the sununu center
um

02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:08.230 --> 02:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
one of the advantages of doing this is
 
02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
the cost to the state are variable
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
instead of the fixed cost and by the way
 
02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't talk anything about
 
02:26:16.150 --> 02:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
the operating expenses roughly eight to
 
02:26:18.070 --> 02:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
nine uh nine to ten million dollars a
 
02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
year in addition to the 15 million
 
02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
dollar construction cost
 
02:26:23.439 --> 02:26:24.389 align:start position:0%
dollar construction cost
if

02:26:24.389 --> 02:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
these children are in a community
 
02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:28.309 align:start position:0%
these children are in a community
facility

02:26:28.309 --> 02:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:26:32.469 --> 02:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:34.790 --> 02:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
a saving of roughly one-third if there
 
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
are three or four children the cost to
 
02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
the state will be four million a year if
 
02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
there are six
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
to eight children the cost will be eight
 
02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
million a year if we go with the bill as
 
02:26:46.950 --> 02:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
as it came over from the senate we're
 
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
hit with a fixed cost of nine to ten
 
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year regardless of the
 
02:26:54.630 --> 02:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
number of children and if 254 passes i
 
02:26:56.230 --> 02:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
believe there will be a significant drop
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
in the number of children who are
 
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
need treatment in sununu or the
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
replacement facility
 
02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
so the bill is introduced puts treatment
 
02:27:06.550 --> 02:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
at the center
 
02:27:08.790 --> 02:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
in a private nonprofit
 
02:27:11.429 --> 02:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
provider secure facility
 
02:27:13.349 --> 02:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
that just might be eligible as i say for
 
02:27:16.389 --> 02:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
medicaid cost sharing
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
i urge the committee to reject what the
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
senate has proposed and come up with
 
02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
what the senate chairman and your
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
committee chairman originally proposed
 
02:27:28.950 --> 02:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
which was child center treatment center
 
02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
and cost-effective
 
02:27:32.070 --> 02:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to do anything else
 
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
and by the way i understand you have a
 
02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:34.870 align:start position:0%
and by the way i understand you have a
deadline

02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
if you don't have an opportunity today
 
02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
to make the tweaks that are necessary to
 
02:27:41.190 --> 02:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
the original bill my understanding this
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
bill is going to house finance
 
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
and i know some of the folks on division
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
three there are very sensitive to this
 
02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
issue and will be more than
 
02:27:50.230 --> 02:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
accommodating to the committee if the
 
02:27:52.550 --> 02:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
chairman would approach them and say
 
02:27:54.630 --> 02:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
we didn't have time to do a b and c
 
02:27:56.230 --> 02:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
please tweak the bill on these policy
 
02:27:56.240 --> 02:27:57.510 align:start position:0%
please tweak the bill on these policy
issues

02:27:57.510 --> 02:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:27:58.870 --> 02:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman i'd be pleased
 
02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions thank you
 
02:28:06.630 --> 02:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:07.990 --> 02:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:28:10.230 --> 02:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
honorable neil kirk for being here today
 
02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
i've heard a lot of great things about
 
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
you and i apologize for not serving with
 
02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:14.790 align:start position:0%
you and i apologize for not serving with
you

02:28:14.790 --> 02:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:16.309 align:start position:0%
you
um

02:28:16.309 --> 02:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:16.319 --> 02:28:17.349 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:28:17.349 --> 02:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:19.510 --> 02:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
you alluded to medicaid cost sharing is
 
02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
that correct yes where do you get that
 
02:28:26.550 --> 02:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
there are provisions in federal law that
 
02:28:28.950 --> 02:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
make a child who is medicaid eligible
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
ineligible to have his
 
02:28:32.230 --> 02:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:33.750 align:start position:0%
cost of
treatment

02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
paid for or co-share paid for by
 
02:28:37.429 --> 02:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
medicaid if he is in a public
 
02:28:37.439 --> 02:28:38.870 align:start position:0%
medicaid if he is in a public
institution

02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
institution
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
and the sununu center qualifies as a
 
02:28:42.389 --> 02:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
public institution
 
02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
there is an exception
 
02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
if the facility has less than 15 beds
 
02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:50.550 align:start position:0%
if the facility has less than 15 beds
and

02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:53.349 --> 02:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
takes in or makes available those beds
 
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
to other
 
02:28:56.630 --> 02:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
children who are not necessarily in the
 
02:28:59.830 --> 02:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
same category and depending on upon how
 
02:29:01.990 --> 02:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
the department would contract this we
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
might find ourselves in a private sector
 
02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
non-profit facility that has 12 to 16
 
02:29:10.030 --> 02:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
beds some of which would be available to
 
02:29:10.040 --> 02:29:11.750 align:start position:0%
beds some of which would be available to
non-sununu

02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
non-sununu
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me non-committed
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
type children and therefore it would
 
02:29:18.389 --> 02:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
qualify for or could qualify for
 
02:29:18.399 --> 02:29:20.830 align:start position:0%
qualify for or could qualify for
medicaid

02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:22.790 align:start position:0%
medicaid
follow-up

02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
so if we could qualify for medicaid why
 
02:29:28.230 --> 02:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
aren't we qualifying for medicaid now we
 
02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
can't qualify for medicaid now sir
 
02:29:33.270 --> 02:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
because we have a facility that is a
 
02:29:35.110 --> 02:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
public institution as defined by the
 
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
feds and that immediately disqualifies
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
the child from receiving medicaid
 
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
sharing for his incarceration costs
 
02:29:44.270 --> 02:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
moreover that facility has a capacity of
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
144 and the maximum under federal law
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:52.950 --> 02:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
final follow-up thank you for answering
 
02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
the question so
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
of course i didn't pull up the previous
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
bill that was
 
02:30:00.309 --> 02:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
introduced in the senate but i do
 
02:30:02.550 --> 02:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
believe that it's still required for
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
secure treatment facility
 
02:30:05.359 --> 02:30:06.230 align:start position:0%
secure treatment facility
which

02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:30:07.590 --> 02:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding of medicaid
 
02:30:09.429 --> 02:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is that it would not be
 
02:30:09.439 --> 02:30:10.550 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is that it would not be
eligible

02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement provided that it is a
 
02:30:14.550 --> 02:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
secure treatment facility so that's
 
02:30:16.790 --> 02:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
where i question that we
 
02:30:19.830 --> 02:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
can do that i've heard both
 
02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
sides of the argument say yes and i and
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
i've heard from sides that say no
 
02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:25.670 align:start position:0%
i've heard from sides that say no
so

02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:26.710 align:start position:0%
so
finding

02:30:26.710 --> 02:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
finding
 
02:30:29.830 --> 02:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know finding this information
 
02:30:31.830 --> 02:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
to its full extent and finding that
 
02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
statute and federal understanding would
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
be beneficial
 
02:30:38.469 --> 02:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
in my decision making process because my
 
02:30:39.910 --> 02:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
understanding i don't have it in front
 
02:30:40.790 --> 02:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
of me
 
02:30:43.270 --> 02:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
it says no we can't if it's privatized
 
02:30:48.150 --> 02:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's not the security of the facility
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's the fact that it's a public
 
02:30:52.080 --> 02:30:53.590 align:start position:0%
it's the fact that it's a public
institution

02:30:53.590 --> 02:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
institution
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
there are people who will follow me and
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
testifying who can add to this
 
02:31:00.150 --> 02:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
and i have a piece i hope i brought it
 
02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
with me that i will share with you i
 
02:31:03.270 --> 02:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
don't have enough copies for everyone
 
02:31:05.670 --> 02:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
and i understand you have a timing issue
 
02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
that you could read and it might perhaps
 
02:31:10.230 --> 02:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
assuage your concerns
 
02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
but i point out to you regardless of
 
02:31:16.389 --> 02:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not medicaid would cost share
 
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
the original bill is introduced is a
 
02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
better bill
 
02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
because it will save us money even if we
 
02:31:23.830 --> 02:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
pay for it as we do with the sununu
 
02:31:26.830 --> 02:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
center with 100 general funds
 
02:31:29.429 --> 02:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
so i don't want that to be i don't want
 
02:31:31.270 --> 02:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
the medicaid cost sharing to be a red
 
02:31:34.150 --> 02:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
herring it's a possible bonus
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
but it's not the reason for going back
 
02:31:40.070 --> 02:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
another

02:31:41.030 --> 02:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh
 
02:31:48.230 --> 02:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative i apologize for serving
 
02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
apology accepted okay thank you
 
02:31:58.389 --> 02:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh the um
 
02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
you mentioned for 12 years at least
 
02:32:03.349 --> 02:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
we've been going for a community based
 
02:32:03.359 --> 02:32:04.309 align:start position:0%
we've been going for a community based
correct

02:32:04.309 --> 02:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:32:07.510 --> 02:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
so how many facilities would there be
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
even if they're private facilities so
 
02:32:11.510 --> 02:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
community base means
 
02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
a manchester resident
 
02:32:16.950 --> 02:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
would be in the manchester area because
 
02:32:19.429 --> 02:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
that's their community
 
02:32:19.439 --> 02:32:20.550 align:start position:0%
that's their community
aware

02:32:20.550 --> 02:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
aware
 
02:32:23.429 --> 02:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
remember where youth would be in
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
a facility somewheres
 
02:32:27.510 --> 02:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
in within that community is that my
 
02:32:27.520 --> 02:32:29.030 align:start position:0%
in within that community is that my
understanding

02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:30.389 align:start position:0%
understanding
no

02:32:30.389 --> 02:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:32:32.469 --> 02:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
there would be a single facility
 
02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
provided by the private nonprofit
 
02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:37.030 align:start position:0%
provided by the private nonprofit
located

02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
located
 
02:32:38.550 --> 02:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the state and both
 
02:32:40.469 --> 02:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
manchester and where children
 
02:32:42.790 --> 02:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
committed to that facility would go
 
02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:43.910 align:start position:0%
committed to that facility would go
there

02:32:43.910 --> 02:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
there are other facilities which provide
 
02:32:48.389 --> 02:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
residential services today under the
 
02:32:49.990 --> 02:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
service of of
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
care program throughout the state
 
02:32:54.389 --> 02:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
but that's very different from what
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
this is a single facility for this very
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
small group of children who need
 
02:33:05.270 --> 02:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
a secure facility to both protect
 
02:33:07.349 --> 02:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
themselves from themselves and or to
 
02:33:10.230 --> 02:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
protect the community from themselves
 
02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of this bill
 
02:33:14.790 --> 02:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
to replace the sununu center with
 
02:33:17.429 --> 02:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
something other than that right follow
 
02:33:20.710 --> 02:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
up for me so community base is
 
02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
not the case
 
02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
community based is not the case for this
 
02:33:27.910 --> 02:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
very small three to eight to ten twelve
 
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
children you're correct okay very good
 
02:33:32.309 --> 02:33:32.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:35.270 --> 02:33:35.280 align:start position:0%

02:34:08.399 --> 02:34:16.469 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:16.479 --> 02:34:18.150 align:start position:0%
 
hi

together in the future i look forward to
 
02:34:28.830 --> 02:34:28.840 align:start position:0%

lawrence to help answer questions as
 
02:34:38.389 --> 02:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:39.510 --> 02:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
she's much more of an expert on this
 
02:34:40.710 --> 02:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
bill as i am at this point but i've done
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
my best to catch up as quickly as i can
 
02:34:45.510 --> 02:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
so today we are here in support of
 
02:34:49.349 --> 02:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
senate bill 458 as it has been amended
 
02:34:51.990 --> 02:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
in the spring of 2021 new hampshire took
 
02:34:53.670 --> 02:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
firm footing and transitioning of the
 
02:34:55.830 --> 02:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
with enhanced resources new pathways to
 
02:35:00.710 --> 02:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
by diverting children from the system
 
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
and in house bill 2 closure of the
 
02:35:04.389 --> 02:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
sprawling youth prison and detention
 
02:35:04.399 --> 02:35:05.429 align:start position:0%
sprawling youth prison and detention
center

02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
center
 
02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
these accomplishments brought new
 
02:35:08.389 --> 02:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire into alignment with the latest
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
science on child development in
 
02:35:12.790 --> 02:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
particular brain development
 
02:35:14.469 --> 02:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
we understand there is concern about the
 
02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
size of the structure and number of beds
 
02:35:18.630 --> 02:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
proposed at the new facility we do agree
 
02:35:20.389 --> 02:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
and we advocate we did advocate for the
 
02:35:22.710 --> 02:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
language of no more than 18 beds we
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
would support amending the current
 
02:35:29.670 --> 02:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:30.870 --> 02:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
several initiatives that were
 
02:35:32.550 --> 02:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
considerably delayed but are now
 
02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
underway predict even less need for
 
02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
the secure detention center and
 
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
confinement facility in the near future
 
02:35:41.590 --> 02:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
under changes being phased in from 2021
 
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
senate bill 94
 
02:35:45.830 --> 02:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
pre-petition assessments are provided
 
02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
proving to be successful in diverting
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
children from the system estimated
 
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
reports of the first two months include
 
02:35:55.270 --> 02:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
80 assessments completed preliminary
 
02:35:57.750 --> 02:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
data shows 70 percent have resulted in
 
02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
children being diverted from court 20
 
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%

02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
behavioral health services such as
 
02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:06.960 align:start position:0%

traditional diversion programs
 
02:36:15.910 --> 02:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore very recently the court
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
rules of probation or conditions of
 
02:36:19.190 --> 02:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
release were changed from 20
 
02:36:22.309 --> 02:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
overwhelming limitations to just four
 
02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
and an individualized plan
 
02:36:26.710 --> 02:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
not attending school or not following
 
02:36:29.030 --> 02:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
curfew are concerns of course but we do
 
02:36:31.190 --> 02:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
not consider those criminal acts
 
02:36:33.349 --> 02:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
individualized plans for each child will
 
02:36:35.270 --> 02:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
address these behaviors and minimize the
 
02:36:39.030 --> 02:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
the office supports the adjusted time to
 
02:36:44.550 --> 02:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
time as articulated on page 1 line 13
 
02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
through 16 of the amended version that
 
02:36:49.670 --> 02:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
provides the department until june 30th
 
02:36:53.270 --> 02:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
2024 to complete the project
 
02:36:54.950 --> 02:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
the community and legislature have
 
02:36:56.469 --> 02:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
demonstrated a lack of trust in the
 
02:36:58.630 --> 02:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
department's plan which to some degree
 
02:37:00.309 --> 02:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
is understandable given the ongoing
 
02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
criminal investigations
 
02:37:04.389 --> 02:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
we feel that we must have confidence in
 
02:37:06.389 --> 02:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
the many community based rollouts that
 
02:37:08.950 --> 02:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
are currently taking place including the
 
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
2021 senate bill 94 allowing the
 
02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:12.710 align:start position:0%
2021 senate bill 94 allowing the
assessments

02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
02:37:14.309 --> 02:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
of need prior to the delinquency
 
02:37:17.750 --> 02:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
petitions being filed
 
02:37:19.190 --> 02:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
our impression is that a state-owned
 
02:37:20.790 --> 02:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
facility will provide the best return on
 
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
investment and most flexible use
 
02:37:24.790 --> 02:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
of the investment
 
02:37:29.349 --> 02:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
as stated page 2 line 25-28
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
by remaining state-run the oca has the
 
02:37:33.349 --> 02:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
ability to maintain oversight with
 
02:37:36.070 --> 02:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
access and ease
 
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
to gain records and immediately respond
 
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
when there are incidents within the
 
02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:43.110 align:start position:0%
when there are incidents within the
center

02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:45.030 --> 02:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony and
 
02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
allowing me to explain
 
02:37:48.150 --> 02:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
why we support the amended version of
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
senate bill 458
 
02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
i'm open for any questions okay thank
 
02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
you representative yokela
 
02:37:56.550 --> 02:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
02:37:58.150 --> 02:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
question um
 
02:37:58.160 --> 02:37:59.349 align:start position:0%
question um
if

02:37:59.349 --> 02:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:38:03.030 --> 02:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
as the previous speaker suggested we not
 
02:38:06.790 --> 02:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
um have a state-run facility um
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
would you
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
and and contracted that out um
 
02:38:12.479 --> 02:38:14.389 align:start position:0%
and and contracted that out um
would

02:38:14.389 --> 02:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
your would you have concerns about that
 
02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:18.550 align:start position:0%
your would you have concerns about that
um

02:38:18.550 --> 02:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
because it seemed like your testimony
 
02:38:24.070 --> 02:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
said that there implied that your your
 
02:38:25.830 --> 02:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
support was contingent on it being a
 
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
state-run facility
 
02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
well we are in support of it being a
 
02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
state-run facility um specifically
 
02:38:32.950 --> 02:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
because of the ease of the office of the
 
02:38:34.790 --> 02:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
child advocate gaining immediate access
 
02:38:37.510 --> 02:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
to records and having oversight um
 
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
within our
 
02:38:40.630 --> 02:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
access to the the records via the
 
02:38:43.429 --> 02:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
computer system um the the case work
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
management system so that just makes it
 
02:38:48.150 --> 02:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
it provides us more ease in getting
 
02:38:51.030 --> 02:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
access we do still have oversight in
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
any agency that is serving children
 
02:38:55.429 --> 02:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
across the state so we would still have
 
02:38:57.190 --> 02:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
the oversight it is the ease for us to
 
02:38:59.030 --> 02:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
gain access and to immediately respond
 
02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
when something happens as
 
02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
we have seen with the sununu center um i
 
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
think one thing that's important to note
 
02:39:06.230 --> 02:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
as well is that
 
02:39:08.230 --> 02:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
we have only been running for four years
 
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
so our oversight of the sununu center is
 
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
very new and so although there have been
 
02:39:13.990 --> 02:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
many complaints over time our
 
02:39:15.990 --> 02:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
involvement has not been with all of
 
02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
congratulations uh mr sanchez thank you
 
02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:30.550 align:start position:0%
congratulations uh mr sanchez thank you
uh

02:39:30.550 --> 02:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:39:34.870 --> 02:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
so so on uh page two starting on line 32
 
02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
um august 1st 2022 they begin reporting
 
02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
to the legislative joint committee
 
02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
on health and human services and to your
 
02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:45.270 align:start position:0%
on health and human services and to your
office

02:39:45.270 --> 02:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
until a facility is operational
 
02:39:49.510 --> 02:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
should those reports continue to your
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
office while the facility is operational
 
02:39:54.870 --> 02:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
we do feel that those should absolutely
 
02:39:56.870 --> 02:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
continue to come to our office yes okay
 
02:39:59.030 --> 02:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
02:40:02.070 --> 02:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative schiller did you yep okay
 
02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair welcome thank you
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
congratulations thank you
 
02:40:06.800 --> 02:40:08.150 align:start position:0%
congratulations thank you
um

02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
within the testimony from the office of
 
02:40:12.389 --> 02:40:12.399 align:start position:0%
the child advocate you um on the second
 
02:40:12.399 --> 02:40:13.750 align:start position:0%
the child advocate you um on the second
page

02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:40:16.389 --> 02:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
you outlined that um
 
02:40:18.469 --> 02:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate urges
 
02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
investment in a small use flexibility
 
02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
for when no children are present with
 
02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
flexible staff job descriptions that can
 
02:40:27.910 --> 02:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
shift to other activities with
 
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
consistent employment could you
 
02:40:34.469 --> 02:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
elaborate on what that looks like
 
02:40:36.150 --> 02:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
what did you have in mind yes emily can
 
02:40:38.230 --> 02:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
you help me answer that so i think part
 
02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
part of that thinking was that you'd
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
have staff that could shift into the
 
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
community to help kids as they're
 
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the community so if we're gonna have
 
02:40:49.030 --> 02:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
and this is somewhat in alignment with
 
02:40:50.309 --> 02:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
the changes that came through with
 
02:40:52.710 --> 02:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
senate bill 94 which is working to
 
02:40:54.710 --> 02:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
divert kids one from even coming into
 
02:40:56.950 --> 02:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
the system but then if they do come into
 
02:40:58.389 --> 02:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
the system for them to each have
 
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
individualized plans and so if you have
 
02:41:02.550 --> 02:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
staff that could be working with those
 
02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
kids while they're in the community to
 
02:41:05.830 --> 02:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
support them maybe support their
 
02:41:08.230 --> 02:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
juvenile probation and parole officers
 
02:41:10.389 --> 02:41:10.399 align:start position:0%
um those could be flexible use staff
 
02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
that was the intent
 
02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:13.830 align:start position:0%
that was the intent
nice

02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
nice
 
02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:14.870 align:start position:0%
nice
follow-up

02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:15.910 align:start position:0%
follow-up
so so

02:41:15.910 --> 02:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
so so
 
02:41:17.830 --> 02:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
the intent from the office of the child
 
02:41:21.269 --> 02:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
advocate is to provide more supports
 
02:41:23.110 --> 02:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
across the board for those children as
 
02:41:25.190 --> 02:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
they move through the system and not
 
02:41:26.950 --> 02:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
rely completely
 
02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
on juvenile justice but provide those
 
02:41:30.469 --> 02:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
supports as they
 
02:41:30.479 --> 02:41:33.269 align:start position:0%
supports as they
um

02:41:33.269 --> 02:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:34.469 --> 02:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
as they
 
02:41:36.230 --> 02:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
transition out of
 
02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
of their
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
high need
 
02:41:42.150 --> 02:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
time at the center
 
02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:42.830 align:start position:0%
time at the center
to

02:41:42.830 --> 02:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:44.550 align:start position:0%
to
gradual

02:41:44.550 --> 02:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
gradual
 
02:41:47.190 --> 02:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
um reintegration into their communities
 
02:41:48.790 --> 02:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
so it's not a full drop off is that what
 
02:41:50.790 --> 02:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
you're saying definitely thank you and
 
02:41:52.630 --> 02:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
in fact right now they're start they're
 
02:41:55.110 --> 02:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
trying to do that um and integrate that
 
02:41:57.349 --> 02:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh plan into the kids that they're
 
02:41:59.349 --> 02:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
working with that's a new to the extent
 
02:42:00.630 --> 02:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
that they can
 
02:42:02.070 --> 02:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
have staff
 
02:42:04.550 --> 02:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
supporting them in the community
 
02:42:06.389 --> 02:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
may fall with one more one more thank
 
02:42:09.190 --> 02:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
you um and so to that end
 
02:42:11.110 --> 02:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh would the office of the child
 
02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
advocates support on page two
 
02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
of the amended bill
 
02:42:17.750 --> 02:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know where it would be in the
 
02:42:19.670 --> 02:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
original but nonetheless
 
02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:20.469 align:start position:0%
original but nonetheless
um

02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:22.550 --> 02:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
line nine part b
 
02:42:24.630 --> 02:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
use of evidence-based practices and
 
02:42:27.910 --> 02:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:29.429 --> 02:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
yes yes we would
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
um we were looking at the language where
 
02:42:32.550 --> 02:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
it says the facility and programming
 
02:42:34.070 --> 02:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
which is line four the facility and
 
02:42:36.389 --> 02:42:36.399 align:start position:0%
programming and operations shall include
 
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
um so not keeping it restricted to
 
02:42:40.309 --> 02:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
evidence evidence-based but also being
 
02:42:42.790 --> 02:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
able to include other research based
 
02:42:45.510 --> 02:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
that will be potentially fit a better
 
02:42:47.830 --> 02:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
fit for that specific child
 
02:42:50.389 --> 02:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
last question madam chair sure um on
 
02:42:52.150 --> 02:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
that same
 
02:42:53.590 --> 02:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
on that same line
 
02:42:55.030 --> 02:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
would the office of the child advocate
 
02:42:56.830 --> 02:42:56.840 align:start position:0%
support adding the phrase
 
02:42:59.110 --> 02:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed evidence-based practices
 
02:43:01.269 --> 02:43:01.279 align:start position:0%
and research-based practices
 
02:43:05.269 --> 02:43:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:07.349 --> 02:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
representative belanger
 
02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you so
 
02:43:10.469 --> 02:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
much for being here today so much
 
02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
congratulations on your appointment
 
02:43:13.349 --> 02:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
looking forward to working with you
 
02:43:14.950 --> 02:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
02:43:14.960 --> 02:43:16.230 align:start position:0%
moving forward
um

02:43:16.230 --> 02:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
have you had a chance to look at the
 
02:43:19.990 --> 02:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill that was introduced i know it's
 
02:43:21.510 --> 02:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
your third day yes
 
02:43:24.150 --> 02:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
okay yes i have yeah thank you
 
02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:25.349 align:start position:0%
okay yes i have yeah thank you
um

02:43:25.349 --> 02:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:26.469 --> 02:43:26.479 align:start position:0%
can you
 
02:43:26.479 --> 02:43:27.910 align:start position:0%
can you
um

02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
what would be the difference of
 
02:43:31.429 --> 02:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
completely privatizing this and what
 
02:43:33.349 --> 02:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
hurdles do you think it would be
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
for the office of the child advocate if
 
02:43:37.590 --> 02:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
this is i'm not saying this is what's
 
02:43:39.030 --> 02:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
going to happen i just want to clarify
 
02:43:41.429 --> 02:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
if in the instance it was a completely
 
02:43:44.710 --> 02:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
privatized situation
 
02:43:46.230 --> 02:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
i think one in which we were speaking
 
02:43:48.389 --> 02:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
about was the the ease of access we do
 
02:43:49.510 --> 02:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
understand that we have that in our
 
02:43:51.990 --> 02:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
newer jurisdiction but um at this point
 
02:43:53.349 --> 02:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
that's not very well known in the
 
02:43:55.349 --> 02:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
community we're working to we're working
 
02:43:56.950 --> 02:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
on that initiative to
 
02:43:58.550 --> 02:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
inform the entire community that we have
 
02:44:01.110 --> 02:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
expanded our jurisdiction so it is the
 
02:44:03.269 --> 02:44:03.279 align:start position:0%
access to the clinical notes and the
 
02:44:05.429 --> 02:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
incidents immediately as they occur
 
02:44:07.990 --> 02:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
as one primary concern the other that we
 
02:44:10.070 --> 02:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
spoke about was the ability to have the
 
02:44:11.670 --> 02:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
flexible staffing
 
02:44:13.830 --> 02:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
if they are you know state workers
 
02:44:15.590 --> 02:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
there's some flexibility and
 
02:44:17.030 --> 02:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
and the ability to
 
02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
use them elsewhere if the facility is
 
02:44:21.269 --> 02:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
not housing the numbers which we feel at
 
02:44:22.630 --> 02:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
some point with all these other
 
02:44:24.070 --> 02:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
initiatives that the numbers are going
 
02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
to greatly reduce from a a full
 
02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:28.870 align:start position:0%
to greatly reduce from a a full
um

02:44:28.870 --> 02:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:30.550 --> 02:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
what's represented here 18 better or
 
02:44:32.309 --> 02:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
potential the the lesser number of 12
 
02:44:34.469 --> 02:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
bed to be even lesser than that so then
 
02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
being able to use that staff in a
 
02:44:38.550 --> 02:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
different capacity
 
02:44:40.309 --> 02:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:44:43.269 --> 02:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:45.200 align:start position:0%

new futures and my organization the
 
02:45:57.269 --> 02:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
disability rights center um and
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
as this this is difficult we're dealing
 
02:46:01.830 --> 02:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
with the most vulnerable children who
 
02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
are really challenging and we're dealing
 
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
with kids who have
 
02:46:08.790 --> 02:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
high intensive treatment needs um and
 
02:46:11.030 --> 02:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
also who are really isolated from their
 
02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:12.309 align:start position:0%
also who are really isolated from their
communities

02:46:12.309 --> 02:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
um as a state when we're considering
 
02:46:17.429 --> 02:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
closing the sununu center
 
02:46:19.110 --> 02:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
our goal should make sure be to make
 
02:46:21.349 --> 02:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
sure that the youth who are committed to
 
02:46:23.670 --> 02:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
a locked facility because it's necessary
 
02:46:25.990 --> 02:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
for them at some juncture in their lives
 
02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
for themselves to receive treatment or
 
02:46:29.429 --> 02:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
because they're unsafe and for the
 
02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
safety of our community we need to make
 
02:46:33.030 --> 02:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
sure that they're going to be better off
 
02:46:36.150 --> 02:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
leaving than they were when they came in
 
02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
and that they're prepared to be living
 
02:46:40.550 --> 02:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
with their families attending their
 
02:46:42.950 --> 02:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
schools graduating from high school
 
02:46:44.790 --> 02:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
maybe going to secondary school
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
post-secondary school and joining the
 
02:46:49.510 --> 02:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
workforce not ending up at our facility
 
02:46:52.070 --> 02:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's way worse on north state street
 
02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:53.750 align:start position:0%
that's way worse on north state street
concord

02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
concord
 
02:46:55.990 --> 02:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
we don't support every aspect of this
 
02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:57.110 align:start position:0%
we don't support every aspect of this
bill

02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:46:59.030 --> 02:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
we're happy to learn of the propose of a
 
02:47:00.550 --> 02:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
proposal for you to consider an
 
02:47:03.590 --> 02:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to look at a smaller
 
02:47:06.710 --> 02:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
number because really it would be
 
02:47:08.230 --> 02:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
we think that most children can have
 
02:47:10.309 --> 02:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
their needs met in the community so
 
02:47:13.429 --> 02:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
getting down to nine or 12 beds with
 
02:47:15.510 --> 02:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
some flexibility makes a lot of sense to
 
02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
us and as i heard some of your
 
02:47:17.600 --> 02:47:19.510 align:start position:0%
us and as i heard some of your
frustration

02:47:19.510 --> 02:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
frustration
 
02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of time that um
 
02:47:23.590 --> 02:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
potentially could be available to get
 
02:47:27.269 --> 02:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
this done seems lengthy to me i am not
 
02:47:29.030 --> 02:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
in construction never had been but it
 
02:47:31.269 --> 02:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
seems like a very long time
 
02:47:34.070 --> 02:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
so if there was you know some amendment
 
02:47:36.070 --> 02:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
to shorten that time or shorten that
 
02:47:38.550 --> 02:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
escape hatch that's fine with us
 
02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:39.349 align:start position:0%
escape hatch that's fine with us
but

02:47:39.349 --> 02:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:47:42.550 --> 02:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
this bill requires a child-centered
 
02:47:45.110 --> 02:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
treatment approach and it requires that
 
02:47:47.030 --> 02:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
it be done in a facility where we know
 
02:47:49.510 --> 02:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
there is significant oversight and
 
02:47:51.590 --> 02:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
michelle will talk about why we can
 
02:47:53.670 --> 02:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
think that this can be accomplished much
 
02:47:55.830 --> 02:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
more easily and much more effectively at
 
02:47:59.670 --> 02:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
a publicly owned and operated facility
 
02:48:01.429 --> 02:48:01.439 align:start position:0%
it does provide i think there were some
 
02:48:03.830 --> 02:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
questions about transition
 
02:48:07.110 --> 02:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
and what the bill does require is that
 
02:48:10.389 --> 02:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
this that dcyf immediately began
 
02:48:13.830 --> 02:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
implementing evidence-based practices at
 
02:48:15.910 --> 02:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
the sununu center with qualified staff
 
02:48:20.309 --> 02:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
and that the provisions in sb 458
 
02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
that are in um i think it's section
 
02:48:24.550 --> 02:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
three but it's roman numeral four on
 
02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:25.510 align:start position:0%
three but it's roman numeral four on
page

02:48:25.510 --> 02:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:48:26.550 --> 02:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
two if i'm looking at the correct
 
02:48:28.469 --> 02:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
version of the bill i think i am that
 
02:48:30.389 --> 02:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
all that all of these provisions with
 
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
staff competency and the practices that
 
02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
are used which actually doesn't do
 
02:48:37.110 --> 02:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
include the way we define evidence-based
 
02:48:39.830 --> 02:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
practices includes research based so
 
02:48:43.110 --> 02:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's not just limited um but that's how
 
02:48:45.269 --> 02:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
we just happened to define it in law
 
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
so it requires that all of these
 
02:48:49.670 --> 02:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
safeguards and the real-time access that
 
02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
the oca has to not just being able to go
 
02:48:54.950 --> 02:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
into the facility but also access to
 
02:48:57.670 --> 02:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
their case management database
 
02:48:59.269 --> 02:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
in place continue
 
02:49:00.870 --> 02:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
at sununu center and then at the
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
replacement facility so and then they're
 
02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:04.630 align:start position:0%
replacement facility so and then they're
also

02:49:04.630 --> 02:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
the bill does not call for any kind of
 
02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:07.750 align:start position:0%
the bill does not call for any kind of
gap

02:49:07.750 --> 02:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
gap
 
02:49:09.990 --> 02:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
in services for these the children who
 
02:49:12.950 --> 02:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
need such a secure setting so what this
 
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
spill does and you can see this on
 
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's page
 
02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:18.150 align:start position:0%
it's page
three

02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:49:20.230 --> 02:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
and it's um
 
02:49:23.030 --> 02:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
section i think it's roman numeral seven
 
02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:23.750 align:start position:0%
section i think it's roman numeral seven
and

02:49:23.750 --> 02:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:25.590 --> 02:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
and then it continues on to section two
 
02:49:26.950 --> 02:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
that basically
 
02:49:29.510 --> 02:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
the the the facility that is now the
 
02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
sununu center continues to operate
 
02:49:34.870 --> 02:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
in in alliance with you know with these
 
02:49:36.870 --> 02:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
practices and trained staff
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
until the opening day of the new
 
02:49:41.429 --> 02:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
facility so we aren't leaving kids in
 
02:49:44.070 --> 02:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
limbo in this bill so i think that was a
 
02:49:46.389 --> 02:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
concern that you all raised so that
 
02:49:49.750 --> 02:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
is is not something um we think this is
 
02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
um the way to do this in a fiscally
 
02:49:54.230 --> 02:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
sound way that actually takes care of
 
02:49:57.110 --> 02:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
kids we don't believe that medicaid will
 
02:49:59.110 --> 02:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
ever cover
 
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
children being locked in a facility
 
02:50:02.469 --> 02:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
there are there is a provision in
 
02:50:04.309 --> 02:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
medicaid that allows for the coverage of
 
02:50:06.150 --> 02:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
psychiatric resident residential
 
02:50:08.469 --> 02:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
treatment but not in unlocked facilities
 
02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
so um michelle maybe you should take it
 
02:50:12.550 --> 02:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
from here thank you yeah before
 
02:50:14.950 --> 02:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
launching into another issue i will just
 
02:50:16.550 --> 02:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
point out i was doing some research as
 
02:50:18.870 --> 02:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
that conversation was happening and i
 
02:50:21.429 --> 02:50:21.439 align:start position:0%
found um some interpretation of the
 
02:50:25.190 --> 02:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:26.230 align:start position:0%
 
guidance

02:50:26.230 --> 02:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
02:50:28.790 --> 02:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
that says that cms regulations define a
 
02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
public institution i'm sorry hold on
 
02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
i was a i won't read you the whole thing
 
02:50:35.269 --> 02:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
cms guidance has interpreted
 
02:50:37.190 --> 02:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities broadly to
 
02:50:39.269 --> 02:50:39.279 align:start position:0%
include private facilities that are
 
02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
under direct contract with a
 
02:50:42.550 --> 02:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
governmental entity to provide
 
02:50:44.710 --> 02:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
correctional services or that are
 
02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise acting as an institution for
 
02:50:46.800 --> 02:50:48.150 align:start position:0%
otherwise acting as an institution for
incarceration

02:50:48.150 --> 02:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
incarceration
 
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
so i would be happy to do some more
 
02:50:52.710 --> 02:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
research to figure out um whether there
 
02:50:54.630 --> 02:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
are any loopholes in that but my
 
02:50:57.190 --> 02:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
understanding has always been that
 
02:51:00.309 --> 02:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
medicaid will not cover children who are
 
02:51:04.309 --> 02:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
in a locked-in facility um that and you
 
02:51:06.070 --> 02:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
know perhaps if there were a locked
 
02:51:07.750 --> 02:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
facility that was
 
02:51:10.389 --> 02:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
not through a contract with the state
 
02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know how that would possibly
 
02:51:14.230 --> 02:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
occur but if there is a contract with
 
02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
the state for a locked facility they are
 
02:51:19.429 --> 02:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
considered a public institution under
 
02:51:21.269 --> 02:51:21.279 align:start position:0%
the center for medicaid services
 
02:51:21.279 --> 02:51:22.469 align:start position:0%
the center for medicaid services
guidance

02:51:22.469 --> 02:51:22.479 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
02:51:26.230 --> 02:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
so um so if i can continue talking i saw
 
02:51:28.070 --> 02:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
a hand raised if it's on that issue i'm
 
02:51:30.790 --> 02:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions on that now
 
02:51:32.550 --> 02:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
okay brief
 
02:51:34.150 --> 02:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
all i was going to ask and thank you
 
02:51:37.349 --> 02:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair is that you um forward that
 
02:51:39.269 --> 02:51:39.279 align:start position:0%
um to me but i appreciate it i'm sure
 
02:51:40.630 --> 02:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
other members would appreciate that
 
02:51:41.910 --> 02:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
being fortunate you would send it to the
 
02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee i would appreciate it so i'll
 
02:51:45.910 --> 02:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
be honest that this this i was doing a
 
02:51:48.230 --> 02:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
quick google search and it was it was
 
02:51:50.230 --> 02:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
guidance from a law firm that is well
 
02:51:52.469 --> 02:51:52.479 align:start position:0%
known for working with state agencies
 
02:51:55.030 --> 02:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
and so is interpretation of of
 
02:51:56.870 --> 02:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
their interpretation of the guidance but
 
02:51:59.190 --> 02:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
i i can find the guidance if it's there
 
02:52:00.550 --> 02:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
i will find it
 
02:52:02.710 --> 02:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
or if i can't for whatever reason i will
 
02:52:05.190 --> 02:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
send you the guidance that i just i just
 
02:52:06.870 --> 02:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
cited to you
 
02:52:06.880 --> 02:52:08.070 align:start position:0%
cited to you
um

02:52:08.070 --> 02:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:09.990 --> 02:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
so one of the other things that that the
 
02:52:12.790 --> 02:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
committee has heard today is that
 
02:52:17.269 --> 02:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps dcyf isn't isn't equipped to
 
02:52:19.110 --> 02:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
manage a new facility and maybe
 
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have the opportunity to do
 
02:52:22.630 --> 02:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
that and one of the reasons is because
 
02:52:24.309 --> 02:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
we all know that there are some major
 
02:52:27.349 --> 02:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
lawsuits going on about conditions at
 
02:52:28.950 --> 02:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
the current facility in the former
 
02:52:28.960 --> 02:52:30.389 align:start position:0%
the current facility in the former
facility

02:52:30.389 --> 02:52:30.399 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:52:31.910 --> 02:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
which is going to cost the state upwards
 
02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
of 100 million dollars
 
02:52:33.600 --> 02:52:35.269 align:start position:0%
of 100 million dollars
um

02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:38.309 --> 02:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
i understand that concern i do i have
 
02:52:40.870 --> 02:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
spent my career working with children in
 
02:52:42.790 --> 02:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
the juvenile justice system those
 
02:52:44.630 --> 02:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
children have been in private facilities
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
they've been in public facilities
 
02:52:49.429 --> 02:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
they've been at the sununu center
 
02:52:51.910 --> 02:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
and and i can tell you that none of
 
02:52:54.309 --> 02:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
those facilities is everything we would
 
02:52:56.070 --> 02:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
like it to be and more they certainly
 
02:52:57.590 --> 02:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
are nothing the children would like them
 
02:52:59.190 --> 02:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
to be and more
 
02:53:02.309 --> 02:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
but what i can say is that in my over a
 
02:53:05.429 --> 02:53:05.439 align:start position:0%
decade doing this we have gotten so much
 
02:53:07.429 --> 02:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
better and the state has gotten so much
 
02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
better when the circumstances that
 
02:53:12.230 --> 02:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
existed in these lawsuits occurred
 
02:53:13.670 --> 02:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
we were in a different we were in a
 
02:53:15.910 --> 02:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
different space we didn't have the
 
02:53:18.389 --> 02:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
system of care we didn't have a
 
02:53:20.230 --> 02:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
therapeutic model which we are working
 
02:53:22.550 --> 02:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
towards and which this bill mandates
 
02:53:25.910 --> 02:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
that we move towards by march 2023 even
 
02:53:28.469 --> 02:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
before the new facility is complete and
 
02:53:30.550 --> 02:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
we didn't have the real time oversight
 
02:53:33.030 --> 02:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
by the office of the child advocate
 
02:53:35.030 --> 02:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
with those pieces
 
02:53:36.150 --> 02:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
in place
 
02:53:39.190 --> 02:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
we are a we have a very transparent
 
02:53:42.950 --> 02:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
system that not only is transparent to
 
02:53:45.349 --> 02:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
an oversight agency but is also
 
02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
transparent in the sense that we
 
02:53:49.269 --> 02:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
that they are covered by the right to
 
02:53:51.990 --> 02:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
know law we can ask for lawsuits against
 
02:53:54.150 --> 02:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
the agency at any time and settlement
 
02:53:56.389 --> 02:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
agreements that the agency has entered
 
02:53:59.349 --> 02:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
into at any time we do not have that
 
02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
ability when it comes to a private
 
02:54:03.830 --> 02:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
facility a private facility is not
 
02:54:06.389 --> 02:54:06.399 align:start position:0%
subject to the right to know law it it
 
02:54:08.710 --> 02:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
can enter into confidential settlement
 
02:54:10.630 --> 02:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
agreements that we will never see that
 
02:54:13.190 --> 02:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
we'll never see the light of day and we
 
02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
don't know what's happening at those
 
02:54:17.750 --> 02:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
facilities we do know that they're not
 
02:54:20.550 --> 02:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
perfect they are subject to
 
02:54:22.870 --> 02:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements and the licensing
 
02:54:25.110 --> 02:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
violations are are public and if you
 
02:54:27.269 --> 02:54:27.279 align:start position:0%
were to go into any new hampshire
 
02:54:29.030 --> 02:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
private facility and look at their via
 
02:54:31.830 --> 02:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
licensing violations you will see a very
 
02:54:35.030 --> 02:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
robust list of them that directly impact
 
02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
the safety of youth but again
 
02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:39.110 align:start position:0%
the safety of youth but again
those

02:54:39.110 --> 02:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:54:41.190 --> 02:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot more scrutiny on
 
02:54:43.670 --> 02:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
the agency itself because of the
 
02:54:45.750 --> 02:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
transparency that we have and because of
 
02:54:47.830 --> 02:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
the oversight that it's under that can't
 
02:54:50.150 --> 02:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
be lost in this and so while we're
 
02:54:51.429 --> 02:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:54:52.870 --> 02:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars of
 
02:54:56.230 --> 02:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
lawsuits because we had a poorly managed
 
02:54:58.950 --> 02:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
system at some point in the past it
 
02:55:00.710 --> 02:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we're we're still
 
02:55:02.630 --> 02:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
there and and i just don't want the
 
02:55:04.469 --> 02:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
committee to lose sight of everything
 
02:55:05.990 --> 02:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
that we have gained through the office
 
02:55:08.230 --> 02:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate and that real-time
 
02:55:11.269 --> 02:55:11.279 align:start position:0%
oversight where they have an integrated
 
02:55:12.870 --> 02:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
case management system where they can
 
02:55:15.670 --> 02:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
look at the records of any child at any
 
02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:16.469 align:start position:0%
look at the records of any child at any
moment

02:55:16.469 --> 02:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
moment
 
02:55:18.550 --> 02:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
that system does not exist with the
 
02:55:20.389 --> 02:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
private facilities they don't have the
 
02:55:22.710 --> 02:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
same case management system they don't
 
02:55:24.389 --> 02:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
some of them don't even keep their lab
 
02:55:26.389 --> 02:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
their records electronically so while
 
02:55:27.990 --> 02:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate could
 
02:55:30.389 --> 02:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
go at any time and meet with any child
 
02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
and have access that way in fact i spoke
 
02:55:34.469 --> 02:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
with moira a few weeks ago and she said
 
02:55:35.830 --> 02:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
that if she really wanted to she could
 
02:55:38.150 --> 02:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
stay the night that's great and i
 
02:55:39.670 --> 02:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
encourage anyone to do that to see
 
02:55:42.469 --> 02:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
what's going on but she doesn't
 
02:55:44.070 --> 02:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
but the office of the child advocate
 
02:55:46.630 --> 02:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
does not have access to those records um
 
02:55:49.110 --> 02:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
and i and i think that that's a
 
02:55:51.910 --> 02:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
a level of oversight that we don't want
 
02:55:54.070 --> 02:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
to go backwards from
 
02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:55.510 align:start position:0%
to go backwards from
um

02:55:55.510 --> 02:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:58.950 --> 02:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
so then um i think so a lot of things
 
02:56:00.870 --> 02:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
have been covered i have a whole list of
 
02:56:02.710 --> 02:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
other things that i wanted to talk about
 
02:56:04.150 --> 02:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to waste your time
 
02:56:06.150 --> 02:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
though so let me just
 
02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:08.070 align:start position:0%
though so let me just
um

02:56:08.070 --> 02:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:11.510 --> 02:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
i think we have covered
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
everything else that i
 
02:56:16.389 --> 02:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to tell you so i'd be happy to um
 
02:56:19.269 --> 02:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
to take any questions and and be either
 
02:56:21.190 --> 02:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
myself or attorney rosenberg may have
 
02:56:24.070 --> 02:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
answers are there any questions
 
02:56:28.710 --> 02:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:30.150 --> 02:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you very
 
02:56:31.830 --> 02:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
much for being here to answer these
 
02:56:33.670 --> 02:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
questions and
 
02:56:35.830 --> 02:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
i wonder if you'll um
 
02:56:38.950 --> 02:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
if this if this might be in your scope
 
02:56:42.309 --> 02:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
we heard some testimony
 
02:56:45.510 --> 02:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
from in relation to another bill
 
02:56:49.990 --> 02:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
but applies the instance applies here
 
02:56:53.110 --> 02:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
should these services be privatized
 
02:56:56.710 --> 02:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
or even partially privatized
 
02:56:59.349 --> 02:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
would there be or is it your opinion
 
02:57:02.070 --> 02:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
that there might be
 
02:57:04.550 --> 02:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
a problem with getting
 
02:57:06.550 --> 02:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
liability insurance
 
02:57:08.950 --> 02:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
for these private facilities we are
 
02:57:08.960 --> 02:57:09.990 align:start position:0%
for these private facilities we are
hearing

02:57:09.990 --> 02:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:57:12.950 --> 02:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
that in other high conflict
 
02:57:12.960 --> 02:57:15.590 align:start position:0%
that in other high conflict
child

02:57:15.590 --> 02:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:15.600 --> 02:57:17.349 align:start position:0%
 
services

02:57:17.349 --> 02:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:57:19.990 --> 02:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
they are losing their limited liability
 
02:57:22.309 --> 02:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
umbrella policies is that something that
 
02:57:24.630 --> 02:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
would be a co that would be a problem if
 
02:57:26.469 --> 02:57:26.479 align:start position:0%
we were to do the same with this type of
 
02:57:26.479 --> 02:57:28.790 align:start position:0%
we were to do the same with this type of
facility

02:57:28.790 --> 02:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:57:30.309 --> 02:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
i mean i know that there's someone else
 
02:57:32.550 --> 02:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
here who um
 
02:57:34.870 --> 02:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
keith kennedy from waypoint could
 
02:57:36.630 --> 02:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
address that for you if you were to call
 
02:57:38.150 --> 02:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
on him i know he doesn't didn't sign up
 
02:57:39.750 --> 02:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
to testify but it's my understanding
 
02:57:41.590 --> 02:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
that that is an issue
 
02:57:44.630 --> 02:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
for um some of the private companies but
 
02:57:46.230 --> 02:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
i i don't feel that i'm qualified to
 
02:57:48.790 --> 02:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
answer that really yeah and and one of
 
02:57:52.389 --> 02:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
the things i i will say just
 
02:57:54.950 --> 02:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
tangentially related to the the issue of
 
02:57:57.110 --> 02:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
liability is
 
02:57:58.950 --> 02:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
what hasn't been thought out in terms of
 
02:57:58.960 --> 02:58:00.469 align:start position:0%
what hasn't been thought out in terms of
privatization

02:58:00.469 --> 02:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
privatization
 
02:58:03.030 --> 02:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
is what's going to happen
 
02:58:05.349 --> 02:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
if the private
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
facility that were to take this contract
 
02:58:11.110 --> 02:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
does not live up to its obligations so
 
02:58:13.750 --> 02:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
we're asking the state to spend
 
02:58:15.750 --> 02:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
potentially a million or more dollars
 
02:58:18.630 --> 02:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
hardening a facility and then expecting
 
02:58:21.750 --> 02:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
that it would be subject to a contract
 
02:58:23.030 --> 02:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
with the state
 
02:58:24.389 --> 02:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
where it has to meet certain
 
02:58:26.389 --> 02:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
deliverables and it has to meet certain
 
02:58:28.469 --> 02:58:28.479 align:start position:0%
safety requirements and when you think
 
02:58:30.790 --> 02:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
about how the contracts work the state
 
02:58:33.349 --> 02:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
has oversight of that
 
02:58:35.190 --> 02:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
and if the if if the facility is not
 
02:58:37.269 --> 02:58:37.279 align:start position:0%
meeting its deliverables and not meeting
 
02:58:39.429 --> 02:58:39.439 align:start position:0%
its safety standards the recourse is to
 
02:58:41.830 --> 02:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
pull the contract but if we've invested
 
02:58:44.469 --> 02:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
all of these this money into a single
 
02:58:47.429 --> 02:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
facility and expect that facility to
 
02:58:49.670 --> 02:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
then serve children under certain
 
02:58:49.680 --> 02:58:51.750 align:start position:0%
then serve children under certain
expectations

02:58:51.750 --> 02:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
expectations
 
02:58:53.510 --> 02:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have that recourse to pull the
 
02:58:55.110 --> 02:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
contract because then where would the
 
02:58:57.510 --> 02:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
children go
 
02:58:59.510 --> 02:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
if it's a state facility
 
02:58:59.520 --> 02:59:00.950 align:start position:0%
if it's a state facility
then

02:59:00.950 --> 02:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:59:00.960 --> 02:59:02.070 align:start position:0%
then
then

02:59:02.070 --> 02:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:59:04.870 --> 02:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
the state is responsible for managing it
 
02:59:07.670 --> 02:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
if if it can't staff its facility just
 
02:59:09.990 --> 02:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
as it did with covid it can pull in
 
02:59:12.550 --> 02:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
staffing from other places so when the
 
02:59:16.230 --> 02:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
sununu center was not able to staff
 
02:59:18.550 --> 02:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
itself properly it was able to call upon
 
02:59:20.630 --> 02:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
the juvenile probation officers to
 
02:59:22.630 --> 02:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
assist with staffing it made sure that
 
02:59:25.269 --> 02:59:25.279 align:start position:0%
it was able to meet the standards that
 
02:59:26.950 --> 02:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
it needed to to ensure the safety of
 
02:59:28.790 --> 02:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
youth that's not something that could
 
02:59:30.950 --> 02:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
happen in private facilities and i and
 
02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
and i just don't know what the recourse
 
02:59:35.590 --> 02:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
would be other than yanking the contract
 
02:59:37.670 --> 02:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
and and wasting the state dollars
 
02:59:40.389 --> 02:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
putting all our eggs in this basket well
 
02:59:40.399 --> 02:59:41.590 align:start position:0%
putting all our eggs in this basket well
or

02:59:41.590 --> 02:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:59:42.950 --> 02:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry or
 
02:59:44.710 --> 02:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
not doing anything
 
02:59:47.190 --> 02:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
and letting the children suffer in poor
 
02:59:47.200 --> 02:59:48.790 align:start position:0%
and letting the children suffer in poor
conditions

02:59:48.790 --> 02:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
02:59:51.269 --> 02:59:51.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean a couple things one is that
 
02:59:51.279 --> 02:59:52.070 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean a couple things one is that
i'm

02:59:52.070 --> 02:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:59:53.349 --> 02:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
one thing to keep in mind is the state
 
02:59:54.950 --> 02:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
does have a contract with dartmouth
 
02:59:57.110 --> 02:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
medical center and so they've been able
 
02:59:59.670 --> 02:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
to secure really high qualified
 
03:00:01.830 --> 03:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
psychiatric services and psychologists
 
03:00:03.429 --> 03:00:03.439 align:start position:0%
so even though there's a workforce
 
03:00:05.830 --> 03:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
shortage in healthcare
 
03:00:07.590 --> 03:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
we know that they have the ability to
 
03:00:09.590 --> 03:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
secure the qualified staff treatment
 
03:00:11.349 --> 03:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
staff that's really needed for these
 
03:00:14.870 --> 03:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
kids and as far as pulling a contract
 
03:00:17.269 --> 03:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
i was the lead investigator in the
 
03:00:19.510 --> 03:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
lakeview investigation several years ago
 
03:00:21.269 --> 03:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
which many of you may have remember
 
03:00:23.590 --> 03:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
included a school for kids a residential
 
03:00:23.600 --> 03:00:24.389 align:start position:0%
included a school for kids a residential
school

03:00:24.389 --> 03:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:00:26.550 --> 03:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
and a facility for adults that was
 
03:00:29.190 --> 03:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
licensed by our state and also was an
 
03:00:30.870 --> 03:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
approved special education placement for
 
03:00:32.630 --> 03:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
children and what our office uncovered
 
03:00:37.110 --> 03:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
was significant abuse physical abuse
 
03:00:39.349 --> 03:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse all kinds and
 
03:00:39.359 --> 03:00:40.150 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse all kinds and
we

03:00:40.150 --> 03:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:00:42.469 --> 03:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
our governor made the you know initially
 
03:00:44.230 --> 03:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
just said no more placements there and
 
03:00:48.550 --> 03:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
eventually the license was revoked and
 
03:00:49.750 --> 03:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
i mean i was
 
03:00:51.750 --> 03:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
proud of the work that i led to uncover
 
03:00:53.750 --> 03:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
this but i'll tell you it was very
 
03:00:55.750 --> 03:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
difficult because when that facility
 
03:00:58.550 --> 03:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
closed there were not places to absorb
 
03:01:01.110 --> 03:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
those children and adults who had been
 
03:01:03.030 --> 03:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
yet subjected to abuse and now they had
 
03:01:05.349 --> 03:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
nowhere to go and we scurried around and
 
03:01:07.110 --> 03:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
tried to help people but some people
 
03:01:09.030 --> 03:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire ended up in florida i
 
03:01:10.550 --> 03:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
mean those are adults
 
03:01:11.750 --> 03:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
children ended up in different
 
03:01:15.349 --> 03:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
placements so it is a problem
 
03:01:18.950 --> 03:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:20.630 --> 03:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
all right sing none thank you very much
 
03:01:22.070 --> 03:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
03:01:23.990 --> 03:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay last pink card
 
03:01:26.389 --> 03:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
the members are getting hungry
 
03:01:37.349 --> 03:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:39.269 --> 03:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am sharon i i hate standing

so
 
03:01:44.469 --> 03:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
please bear with me i
 
03:01:46.830 --> 03:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
i may repeat i will do my best not to

continue to support the
 
03:02:28.710 --> 03:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
senate bill 458 as was originally
 
03:02:30.710 --> 03:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
introduced which you've heard repeatedly
 
03:02:32.469 --> 03:02:32.479 align:start position:0%
today and what we have is we have two
 
03:02:35.110 --> 03:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
very different approaches so i support
 
03:02:36.790 --> 03:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
the originally introduced approach and
 
03:02:38.309 --> 03:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
i'll explain why
 
03:02:40.950 --> 03:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
before i begin i do want to just a
 
03:02:42.230 --> 03:02:42.240 align:start position:0%

for as long as i have worked on this
 
03:02:58.720 --> 03:03:00.469 align:start position:0%
for as long as i have worked on this
issue

03:03:00.469 --> 03:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:03:02.469 --> 03:03:02.479 align:start position:0%
i've worked with adolescents in some
 
03:03:04.309 --> 03:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
capacity or another for more than 35
 
03:03:04.319 --> 03:03:05.190 align:start position:0%
capacity or another for more than 35
years

03:03:05.190 --> 03:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:03:07.510 --> 03:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
mostly in the psychiatric mental health
 
03:03:07.520 --> 03:03:08.710 align:start position:0%
mostly in the psychiatric mental health
realm

03:03:08.710 --> 03:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
realm
 
03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
i've been aware of and working on this
 
03:03:13.750 --> 03:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
issue to close this center
 
03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
since it opened
 
03:03:19.190 --> 03:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
in 2006 seven
 
03:03:20.230 --> 03:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
but when
 
03:03:24.389 --> 03:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:25.910 --> 03:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
we talk about moving children to a
 
03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
treatment facility that provides
 
03:03:30.710 --> 03:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
humane trauma-informed care
 
03:03:32.710 --> 03:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
that gives the children the best chance
 
03:03:34.550 --> 03:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
of success
 
03:03:37.110 --> 03:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
we don't talk about closing sununu to
 
03:03:39.349 --> 03:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
build a mini sununu
 
03:03:41.190 --> 03:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
that's not closing at that we might as
 
03:03:44.870 --> 03:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
we put great emphasis on the state law
 
03:03:50.950 --> 03:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
which says that children ought to be in
 
03:03:53.990 --> 03:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
them in the least restrictive
 
03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.309 align:start position:0%
them in the least restrictive
alternative

03:03:56.309 --> 03:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
03:03:58.630 --> 03:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate alternative
 
03:04:00.230 --> 03:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
we think that is what should drive
 
03:04:02.790 --> 03:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
everything that we work on regarding
 
03:04:02.800 --> 03:04:05.590 align:start position:0%
everything that we work on regarding
children

03:04:05.590 --> 03:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:07.030 --> 03:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and our juvenile justice
 
03:04:09.590 --> 03:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
system finds itself at a crossroad
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
we found ourselves at a similar
 
03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:11.910 align:start position:0%
we found ourselves at a similar
crossroad

03:04:11.910 --> 03:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
crossroad
 
03:04:13.269 --> 03:04:13.279 align:start position:0%
20 years ago
 
03:04:16.469 --> 03:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
following the 1990s the rise in crime
 
03:04:19.910 --> 03:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
an apparent rise in juvenile crime
 
03:04:22.790 --> 03:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
this legislature chose to build 144 bid
 
03:04:27.030 --> 03:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
facility at that point and that decision
 
03:04:29.269 --> 03:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
framed the entirety of our juveniles
 
03:04:31.750 --> 03:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
justice system for the next 20 years up
 
03:04:33.670 --> 03:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
until where we are now
 
03:04:38.710 --> 03:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:40.389 --> 03:04:40.399 align:start position:0%
we are discussing whether we should
 
03:04:43.429 --> 03:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
build the mini sununu
 
03:04:46.630 --> 03:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
as recommended in this bill before you
 
03:04:48.790 --> 03:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
recommended by dcyf
 
03:04:50.790 --> 03:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
or whether we should
 
03:04:54.790 --> 03:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
fully include these six to 12 children
 
03:04:57.190 --> 03:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
in the existing children's behavioral
 
03:05:00.550 --> 03:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:00.560 --> 03:05:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
now

03:05:01.830 --> 03:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:05:02.830 --> 03:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
03:05:05.349 --> 03:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
consider youth prison
 
03:05:08.870 --> 03:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:10.630 --> 03:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
i do consider psychiatric
 
03:05:10.640 --> 03:05:12.070 align:start position:0%
i do consider psychiatric
hospitalization

03:05:12.070 --> 03:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
hospitalization
 
03:05:13.349 --> 03:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
psychiatric residential treatment
 
03:05:16.070 --> 03:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
facilities part of the system of care
 
03:05:18.630 --> 03:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
but most kids don't move through prison
 
03:05:19.990 --> 03:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's why it's not part of the system
 
03:05:21.349 --> 03:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
of care
 
03:05:23.830 --> 03:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
a colleague of mine used to testify
 
03:05:25.830 --> 03:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
before this committee and others
 
03:05:25.840 --> 03:05:27.190 align:start position:0%
before this committee and others
frequently

03:05:27.190 --> 03:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
03:05:29.190 --> 03:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
and he said the same thing
 
03:05:30.950 --> 03:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
every time
 
03:05:33.830 --> 03:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a long history
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
of over-incarcerating
 
03:05:37.990 --> 03:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
low-level offenders
 
03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
that's why this committee passed 254
 
03:05:41.670 --> 03:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
last year
 
03:05:43.269 --> 03:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
because you understood that we
 
03:05:45.429 --> 03:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
over-incarcerate low-level offenders i
 
03:05:49.030 --> 03:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
would add to that new hampshire has
 
03:05:51.750 --> 03:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
and is overly reliant
 
03:05:54.469 --> 03:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
on institutional levels of care
 
03:05:58.150 --> 03:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
both among children and adults
 
03:06:01.429 --> 03:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
what the original 458 is introduced
 
03:06:04.230 --> 03:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
gives us the opportunity to do
 
03:06:06.230 --> 03:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
is to move away from that
 
03:06:10.630 --> 03:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
in an organized safe manner
 
03:06:13.429 --> 03:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
to a system that can give kids the best
 
03:06:17.429 --> 03:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:19.110 --> 03:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
there are lots of reasons i'm going to
 
03:06:20.790 --> 03:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
share a couple there are lots of reasons
 
03:06:25.030 --> 03:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
why a mini sununu does not make sense
 
03:06:27.269 --> 03:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
chief among them is that the
 
03:06:30.710 --> 03:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
census in fiscal year 21 averaged about
 
03:06:30.720 --> 03:06:32.710 align:start position:0%
census in fiscal year 21 averaged about
12.

03:06:32.710 --> 03:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
12.
 
03:06:35.349 --> 03:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
the census this fiscal year is under 12
 
03:06:37.429 --> 03:06:37.439 align:start position:0%
i think it's about 11 and three quarters
 
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
so we're seeing that you know there's
 
03:06:41.830 --> 03:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
some stagnation in the census but we
 
03:06:43.750 --> 03:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
also see the number of detained kids
 
03:06:45.510 --> 03:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
tends to be going up month over month
 
03:06:47.110 --> 03:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
while the number of committed kids tends
 
03:06:48.469 --> 03:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
to be going down
 
03:06:50.630 --> 03:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
and that ms ross appropriately said
 
03:06:52.870 --> 03:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's variable it is variable but we're
 
03:06:54.389 --> 03:06:54.399 align:start position:0%
having more and more detained kids than
 
03:06:56.389 --> 03:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
we've ever had before through the
 
03:06:58.469 --> 03:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
history of this facility
 
03:07:00.389 --> 03:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
and you can see that through the data
 
03:07:01.910 --> 03:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
over the last
 
03:07:04.870 --> 03:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
over the last decade
 
03:07:06.710 --> 03:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's also important to understand that
 
03:07:09.750 --> 03:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
dcyf has testified repeatedly that 75
 
03:07:11.190 --> 03:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
percent of the kids
 
03:07:14.309 --> 03:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
at sununu at sysc
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
are dealing with behavioral health
 
03:07:16.319 --> 03:07:20.469 align:start position:0%
are dealing with behavioral health
issues

03:07:20.469 --> 03:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:21.910 --> 03:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
so we're looking for the best way to
 
03:07:24.230 --> 03:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
treat these kids
 
03:07:26.550 --> 03:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
makes sense but we also know that kids
 
03:07:29.990 --> 03:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
that are committed or detained at sununu
 
03:07:31.750 --> 03:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
and are released
 
03:07:34.630 --> 03:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
nearly two-thirds of the time
 
03:07:37.349 --> 03:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
return to sununu
 
03:07:39.910 --> 03:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
if 66
 
03:07:42.230 --> 03:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
of people fail at anything
 
03:07:44.710 --> 03:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
that's not giving kids the best chance
 
03:07:46.469 --> 03:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
to recover
 
03:07:48.230 --> 03:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
we have a better way and it's the it's
 
03:07:49.510 --> 03:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
the way that i'm talking about in the
 
03:07:52.469 --> 03:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
original senate bill 458.
 
03:07:54.790 --> 03:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
just for for illustration
 
03:07:56.230 --> 03:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
assuming there's 12 kids there which is
 
03:07:58.070 --> 03:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
what it's been lately
 
03:08:00.150 --> 03:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
eight of the kids who were discharged
 
03:08:02.389 --> 03:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
will return to sununu
 
03:08:08.309 --> 03:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:10.230 --> 03:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
bear with me i moved some passages
 
03:08:10.240 --> 03:08:11.110 align:start position:0%
bear with me i moved some passages
around

03:08:11.110 --> 03:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:08:11.120 --> 03:08:11.990 align:start position:0%
around
um

03:08:11.990 --> 03:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:13.990 --> 03:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
the most straightforward solution is the
 
03:08:17.590 --> 03:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
original senate bill 458 and add to the
 
03:08:20.950 --> 03:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
original language more robust oversight
 
03:08:24.630 --> 03:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
as you've heard today is required it was
 
03:08:26.309 --> 03:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
it was not included in the original
 
03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
language through numerous conversations
 
03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to make to add more
 
03:08:32.550 --> 03:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
robust oversight and i'll i'll speak to
 
03:08:32.560 --> 03:08:35.190 align:start position:0%
robust oversight and i'll i'll speak to
that

03:08:35.190 --> 03:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:37.990 --> 03:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
dcyf already has oversight
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
as the contractor the oca as you heard
 
03:08:43.269 --> 03:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
already has oversight
 
03:08:45.269 --> 03:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
you heard ms wagner and talk about
 
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreements and and
 
03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
private agreements
 
03:08:50.070 --> 03:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
one of the oversight measures we think
 
03:08:53.830 --> 03:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
would be essential is that contractually
 
03:08:57.750 --> 03:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
the department ought to specify with the
 
03:08:57.760 --> 03:08:59.670 align:start position:0%
the department ought to specify with the
provider

03:08:59.670 --> 03:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
provider
 
03:09:01.830 --> 03:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
that there can be no nda's to shield
 
03:09:04.230 --> 03:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
them from from any untoward events or
 
03:09:06.230 --> 03:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
any critical incident events that only
 
03:09:09.750 --> 03:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
seems reasonable i'm would even suggest
 
03:09:11.910 --> 03:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
giving the oca an additional staff
 
03:09:11.920 --> 03:09:12.950 align:start position:0%
giving the oca an additional staff
person

03:09:12.950 --> 03:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:09:15.030 --> 03:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
for the next two years
 
03:09:17.429 --> 03:09:17.439 align:start position:0%
with their only job being to oversee
 
03:09:19.990 --> 03:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
this new contracted facility of six to
 
03:09:21.190 --> 03:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
twelve kids
 
03:09:23.190 --> 03:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
and at the end of a year or two
 
03:09:25.110 --> 03:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
you all can talk to the oca about
 
03:09:27.030 --> 03:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
whether that's necessary
 
03:09:28.950 --> 03:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
and then use the oca can use that staff
 
03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:34.309 --> 03:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
you see
 
03:09:36.309 --> 03:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
we should never be afraid of oversight
 
03:09:38.630 --> 03:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
and transparency so the more
 
03:09:40.550 --> 03:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
transparency oversight we want to add to
 
03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
the original 458
 
03:09:44.630 --> 03:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
bring it on i'm all in for as much
 
03:09:46.710 --> 03:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
oversight as we can
 
03:09:49.510 --> 03:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
we all want the same thing we all want
 
03:09:49.520 --> 03:09:50.389 align:start position:0%
we all want the same thing we all want
kids

03:09:50.389 --> 03:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
kids
 
03:09:56.870 --> 03:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:58.469 --> 03:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
there's a perception
 
03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
and you you heard inklings of it but
 
03:10:02.389 --> 03:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
there's a perception that these are
 
03:10:04.870 --> 03:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
dangerous kids
 
03:10:07.030 --> 03:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
and occasionally
 
03:10:07.040 --> 03:10:08.309 align:start position:0%
and occasionally
rarely

03:10:08.309 --> 03:10:08.319 align:start position:0%
rarely
 
03:10:10.550 --> 03:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire there are children who
 
03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
commit heinous crimes we can name them
 
03:10:15.349 --> 03:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's how infrequently it happens
 
03:10:17.429 --> 03:10:17.439 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of kids we're talking
 
03:10:20.150 --> 03:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
about are not dangerous kids what they
 
03:10:22.469 --> 03:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
are is their kids who have had a really
 
03:10:24.710 --> 03:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
rough start either for personal or
 
03:10:26.710 --> 03:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
family circumstances
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
they have the most high
 
03:10:32.309 --> 03:10:32.319 align:start position:0%
the most complex needs of any children
 
03:10:34.389 --> 03:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
03:10:36.309 --> 03:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
and the way we up until now have
 
03:10:38.070 --> 03:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
responded to them is by putting them in
 
03:10:38.080 --> 03:10:39.990 align:start position:0%
responded to them is by putting them in
jail

03:10:39.990 --> 03:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
jail
 
03:10:42.550 --> 03:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
we as a state can and should do better
 
03:10:44.950 --> 03:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
with these children
 
03:10:47.190 --> 03:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
they need complex needs yes they do
 
03:10:49.429 --> 03:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
stupid stuff and come into contact with
 
03:10:51.269 --> 03:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
03:10:52.830 --> 03:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
they ought to be held
 
03:10:55.349 --> 03:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
accountable but their life shouldn't be
 
03:10:57.349 --> 03:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
destroyed because of it
 
03:10:59.269 --> 03:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
right as i as i testified to senate
 
03:11:00.710 --> 03:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
judiciary the other day
 
03:11:03.510 --> 03:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 254 the only consequence
 
03:11:05.750 --> 03:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's off the table is going to sununu
 
03:11:08.469 --> 03:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
every other consequence continues to be
 
03:11:10.550 --> 03:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
on the table but to the extent that we
 
03:11:13.190 --> 03:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
can keep these kids in in or close to
 
03:11:15.190 --> 03:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
their home community that's what we
 
03:11:17.510 --> 03:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
ought to be doing that's the purpose of
 
03:11:20.469 --> 03:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:22.469 --> 03:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
the system of care is not just group
 
03:11:25.030 --> 03:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
homes it's a full range of care to
 
03:11:26.630 --> 03:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
provide the right care at the right
 
03:11:28.469 --> 03:11:28.479 align:start position:0%
moment in the kids life in the right
 
03:11:28.479 --> 03:11:30.309 align:start position:0%
moment in the kids life in the right
location

03:11:30.309 --> 03:11:30.319 align:start position:0%
location
 
03:11:32.309 --> 03:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
now by the time the kid gets into court
 
03:11:33.910 --> 03:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
it may be a little late
 
03:11:34.830 --> 03:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
to go
 
03:11:38.389 --> 03:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
upstream but as we do this
 
03:11:41.030 --> 03:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
as we focus on these kids as being
 
03:11:44.389 --> 03:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
worthy of this level of care
 
03:11:46.469 --> 03:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
we will intervene in the future
 
03:11:48.950 --> 03:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
consequences to prevent them from need
 
03:11:54.710 --> 03:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
you've heard
 
03:11:59.510 --> 03:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:02.229 --> 03:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
private facilities and let me just say i
 
03:12:05.110 --> 03:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
i reject the concept that the original
 
03:12:08.150 --> 03:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
bill privatizes the juvenile justice
 
03:12:10.150 --> 03:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
system it does not
 
03:12:12.389 --> 03:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
what it does is it treats juvenile
 
03:12:14.070 --> 03:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
justice or kids in the juvenile justice
 
03:12:16.950 --> 03:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
system the same way every other child in
 
03:12:19.429 --> 03:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
the system of care is treated
 
03:12:21.510 --> 03:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
every program in the system of care is
 
03:12:21.520 --> 03:12:23.030 align:start position:0%
every program in the system of care is
contracted

03:12:23.030 --> 03:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
contracted
 
03:12:25.269 --> 03:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
this is nothing more than a contract is
 
03:12:28.070 --> 03:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:30.469 --> 03:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
but let me just stipulate any
 
03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
abuse towards any child in any location
 
03:12:35.269 --> 03:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
is unacceptable
 
03:12:37.750 --> 03:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
none of us would tolerate that
 
03:12:39.990 --> 03:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
and to accept for the moment
 
03:12:42.550 --> 03:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
that the arguments
 
03:12:42.560 --> 03:12:44.229 align:start position:0%
that the arguments
um

03:12:44.229 --> 03:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:46.550 --> 03:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
hold up to accept for a moment that dcyf
 
03:12:47.830 --> 03:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
and the child advocate have full
 
03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
oversight authority which we've heard
 
03:12:51.030 --> 03:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
that they do
 
03:12:53.349 --> 03:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
regarding the group homes
 
03:12:54.950 --> 03:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any contracts that have
 
03:12:56.870 --> 03:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
been removed from group homes
 
03:12:59.349 --> 03:12:59.359 align:start position:0%
in the last several years i know that
 
03:13:00.790 --> 03:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
one was referenced that i'm not familiar
 
03:13:02.950 --> 03:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
with in the last several years regarding
 
03:13:05.110 --> 03:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
in regard to abusive behavior
 
03:13:07.510 --> 03:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
the oca did an investigation in december
 
03:13:10.229 --> 03:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
of a provider and came back with
 
03:13:10.239 --> 03:13:11.830 align:start position:0%
of a provider and came back with
findings

03:13:11.830 --> 03:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
findings
 
03:13:13.269 --> 03:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
the department
 
03:13:15.190 --> 03:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
in their public statement through the
 
03:13:17.830 --> 03:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
media talked about how they have a
 
03:13:20.070 --> 03:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
contracted system provide sufficient
 
03:13:20.080 --> 03:13:21.750 align:start position:0%
contracted system provide sufficient
oversight

03:13:21.750 --> 03:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
03:13:23.110 --> 03:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
so the department believes they are
 
03:13:25.110 --> 03:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
providing sufficient oversight at the at
 
03:13:26.790 --> 03:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
the current time
 
03:13:26.800 --> 03:13:34.070 align:start position:0%
the current time
um

03:13:34.070 --> 03:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:37.110 --> 03:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
let's contrast though that type of
 
03:13:38.590 --> 03:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
system of care
 
03:13:41.030 --> 03:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
community-based system that i've been
 
03:13:43.670 --> 03:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
talking about with the sununu youth
 
03:13:46.309 --> 03:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
services center there are currently 11
 
03:13:48.070 --> 03:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
staff members
 
03:13:49.590 --> 03:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
who are incarcerated for various
 
03:13:51.670 --> 03:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
offenses primarily sexual assault or
 
03:13:54.150 --> 03:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
some version of sexual assault more than
 
03:13:56.870 --> 03:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
500 children
 
03:13:58.469 --> 03:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
have alleged
 
03:14:01.429 --> 03:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
abuse at that facility
 
03:14:02.710 --> 03:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
i recently spoke with plaintiff
 
03:14:02.720 --> 03:14:03.750 align:start position:0%
i recently spoke with plaintiff
attorneys

03:14:03.750 --> 03:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
03:14:05.190 --> 03:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
plaintiff attorneys have told me
 
03:14:07.750 --> 03:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
currently the most recent allegation of
 
03:14:09.510 --> 03:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
abuse that they have
 
03:14:13.030 --> 03:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:14.550 --> 03:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean there's nothing newer
 
03:14:15.910 --> 03:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean there will be anything
 
03:14:17.990 --> 03:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
newer but what they have told me is that
 
03:14:19.349 --> 03:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
currently the most
 
03:14:25.190 --> 03:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
we also have you heard about the victims
 
03:14:28.309 --> 03:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
compensation but i don't even want to
 
03:14:29.830 --> 03:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
talk about the compensation fund and
 
03:14:31.590 --> 03:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you why
 
03:14:32.950 --> 03:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
03:14:34.469 --> 03:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about money we get
 
03:14:36.309 --> 03:14:36.319 align:start position:0%
lost in the money we get lost in the
 
03:14:38.950 --> 03:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
oversight we get lost in we lose the
 
03:14:40.790 --> 03:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
kids in this
 
03:14:42.790 --> 03:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about children
 
03:14:45.190 --> 03:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
we need to focus on this as though their
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
lives depended on it
 
03:14:48.630 --> 03:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
because it does
 
03:14:51.670 --> 03:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
i will the final point that i'll make to
 
03:14:51.680 --> 03:14:53.510 align:start position:0%
i will the final point that i'll make to
you

03:14:53.510 --> 03:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:14:55.910 --> 03:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:14:59.190 --> 03:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
if to the extent that group homes treat
 
03:15:02.309 --> 03:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
children badly please do not forget
 
03:15:05.030 --> 03:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
that we have more than 300 children in
 
03:15:06.550 --> 03:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
residential care
 
03:15:08.229 --> 03:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
on any given month and slightly under
 
03:15:10.229 --> 03:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
that now based on the health and human
 
03:15:13.349 --> 03:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
services dashboard if these six to 12
 
03:15:15.590 --> 03:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
children in juvenile justice if the
 
03:15:17.910 --> 03:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
group homes are not appropriate for them
 
03:15:20.469 --> 03:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
why do we have 300 other children
 
03:15:25.190 --> 03:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:27.510 --> 03:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
why aren't we actively investigating
 
03:15:30.710 --> 03:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
every group home removing every child
 
03:15:33.190 --> 03:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
the answer is simple
 
03:15:35.830 --> 03:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
that can there are concerns
 
03:15:38.309 --> 03:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
but the concerns that addressed don't
 
03:15:41.030 --> 03:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
represent systemic
 
03:15:43.349 --> 03:15:43.359 align:start position:0%
concerns they represent
 
03:15:43.359 --> 03:15:45.190 align:start position:0%
concerns they represent
um

03:15:45.190 --> 03:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:48.229 --> 03:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
anecdotal concerns nonetheless important
 
03:15:51.750 --> 03:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:53.990 --> 03:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
to end my testimony representative
 
03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:55.030 align:start position:0%
to end my testimony representative

03:15:57.750 --> 03:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks ago
 
03:16:00.389 --> 03:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
she received a letter during her work
 
03:16:02.790 --> 03:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
with the uh
 
03:16:04.950 --> 03:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
the compensation fund
 
03:16:07.030 --> 03:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
she told me this letter is the most
 
03:16:09.750 --> 03:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
compelling letter from a victim of
 
03:16:11.910 --> 03:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
sununu abuse that she has received and
 
03:16:14.070 --> 03:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
has asked me to read it into the record
 
03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to read any of the record
 
03:16:17.590 --> 03:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
i can madam chair
 
03:16:18.790 --> 03:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to read into the record
 
03:16:20.950 --> 03:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
because of time but i do i'm going to
 
03:16:22.710 --> 03:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
give you a copy but i want to excerpt a
 
03:16:25.190 --> 03:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
couple of points that i think are really
 
03:16:25.200 --> 03:16:26.469 align:start position:0%
couple of points that i think are really
important

03:16:26.469 --> 03:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:16:31.190 --> 03:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
this is written by a 30 31 year old man
 
03:16:34.070 --> 03:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
currently incarcerated at the northern
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
correctional facility in berlin
 
03:16:38.550 --> 03:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
and he starts by saying i'm a survivor
 
03:16:41.030 --> 03:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
and vic and victim of whitey's of the
 
03:16:44.309 --> 03:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
ydc state-run facility and abuse scandal
 
03:16:46.630 --> 03:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
but he goes on to say he was abused at
 
03:16:50.870 --> 03:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
other facilities as well not just at ydc
 
03:16:53.910 --> 03:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
he talks at length of what he refers to
 
03:16:57.830 --> 03:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
as years of abuse torture says sexually
 
03:17:01.349 --> 03:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
physically mentally emotionally
 
03:17:03.670 --> 03:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
nothing can ever take that away
 
03:17:05.030 --> 03:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
but he
 
03:17:07.190 --> 03:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
asks for the state to acknowledge
 
03:17:09.429 --> 03:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility for what has happened to
 
03:17:11.670 --> 03:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
children he believes that is essential
 
03:17:14.469 --> 03:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
both for the state and for the victims
 
03:17:18.070 --> 03:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to put some put some closure
 
03:17:20.309 --> 03:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
he goes on to say that these
 
03:17:22.870 --> 03:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
his physical wounds have healed
 
03:17:24.710 --> 03:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
but the scars
 
03:17:27.349 --> 03:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
the torture the trauma
 
03:17:30.630 --> 03:17:30.640 align:start position:0%

temporary

03:17:48.150 --> 03:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
03:17:49.510 --> 03:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
the effects
 
03:17:53.269 --> 03:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:55.349 --> 03:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
with that i would

03:18:10.389 --> 03:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
it is a far more child-centered bill
 
03:18:12.389 --> 03:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
takes into consideration
 
03:18:14.150 --> 03:18:14.160 align:start position:0%

what i received in terms of data

03:18:49.030 --> 03:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
all the children who were either
 
03:18:50.550 --> 03:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
detained or committed to the sununu
 
03:18:53.110 --> 03:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
center and all of the charges it didn't
 
03:18:55.110 --> 03:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
have the confining charge
 
03:18:56.389 --> 03:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the confining charge
 
03:18:59.190 --> 03:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
was it had all of the charges that those
 
03:19:01.510 --> 03:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
children were
 
03:19:03.110 --> 03:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that more than fifty
 
03:19:07.590 --> 03:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
percent of the children in those two
 
03:19:10.389 --> 03:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
years were in sununu for misdemeanor
 
03:19:10.399 --> 03:19:11.590 align:start position:0%
years were in sununu for misdemeanor
offenses

03:19:11.590 --> 03:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
03:19:14.790 --> 03:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that if 254 passed
 
03:19:17.429 --> 03:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
about eight or nine percent of all of
 
03:19:18.710 --> 03:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
the charges
 
03:19:19.910 --> 03:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
only eight or nine percent of all the
 
03:19:19.920 --> 03:19:20.870 align:start position:0%
only eight or nine percent of all the
charges

03:19:20.870 --> 03:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
charges
 
03:19:23.750 --> 03:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
would have been met for confinement at
 
03:19:23.760 --> 03:19:25.429 align:start position:0%
would have been met for confinement at
sununu

03:19:25.429 --> 03:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
sununu
 
03:19:26.550 --> 03:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
does it mean they'll only be eight or
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
nine percent of the kids because there's
 
03:19:30.389 --> 03:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
multiple charges but
 
03:19:33.030 --> 03:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
92 percent of the charges did not meet
 
03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
the conditions of house bill 254 and
 
03:19:36.469 --> 03:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that
 
03:19:38.070 --> 03:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:19:40.389 --> 03:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
okay so yep okay i got i got one more
 
03:19:42.870 --> 03:19:42.880 align:start position:0%

too
 
03:19:45.510 --> 03:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
um but i just want to let the committee
 
03:19:47.750 --> 03:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
members know that what we'll do is when
 
03:19:49.590 --> 03:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
we're done with this we'll hear the next
 
03:19:52.950 --> 03:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
bill quickly if it's because it's almost
 
03:19:55.510 --> 03:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
1 30 and then we'll break for lunch
 
03:19:58.309 --> 03:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
and and i apologize i really did not
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
plan well today so i'm so sorry so up
 
03:20:05.030 --> 03:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
next is representative mary jane walner
 
03:20:09.670 --> 03:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:11.910 --> 03:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
where'd he go thank you madam chair and
 
03:20:13.750 --> 03:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to take two minutes i'm
 
03:20:15.269 --> 03:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
going to take much less than that
 
03:20:16.550 --> 03:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
because i think
 
03:20:19.590 --> 03:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
you've had a full morning of um
 
03:20:21.750 --> 03:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
hearing testimony
 
03:20:24.150 --> 03:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
but i will say that i was so
 
03:20:24.160 --> 03:20:25.429 align:start position:0%
but i will say that i was so
disappointed

03:20:25.429 --> 03:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
disappointed
 
03:20:27.510 --> 03:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
when i saw what came back from the
 
03:20:27.520 --> 03:20:30.309 align:start position:0%
when i saw what came back from the
senate

03:20:30.309 --> 03:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:32.630 --> 03:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
i've been working on this issue for many
 
03:20:34.790 --> 03:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
years mostly through the finance
 
03:20:34.800 --> 03:20:35.830 align:start position:0%
years mostly through the finance
committee

03:20:35.830 --> 03:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:20:39.190 --> 03:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
and looking at the sununu center in the
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of running the sununu center
 
03:20:45.510 --> 03:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
but again what came back from the senate
 
03:20:48.950 --> 03:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
was again a focus on the building
 
03:20:51.510 --> 03:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
and not on moving
 
03:20:53.830 --> 03:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
towards caring for these young people
 
03:20:57.110 --> 03:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
with community-based services
 
03:20:59.590 --> 03:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
a number of the children
 
03:21:01.429 --> 03:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
will need secure
 
03:21:03.429 --> 03:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
residential placement
 
03:21:05.750 --> 03:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
but we know that many of these children
 
03:21:07.830 --> 03:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
would be better served in their
 
03:21:07.840 --> 03:21:08.950 align:start position:0%
would be better served in their
community

03:21:08.950 --> 03:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:21:11.269 --> 03:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
and in their own homes
 
03:21:12.870 --> 03:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
some of these children
 
03:21:15.910 --> 03:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
and families need services the whole
 
03:21:17.830 --> 03:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
family needs services
 
03:21:20.469 --> 03:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
not just the child
 
03:21:20.479 --> 03:21:21.590 align:start position:0%
not just the child
and

03:21:21.590 --> 03:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:23.750 --> 03:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
moving them into residential
 
03:21:26.790 --> 03:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
incarceration does not meet the needs of
 
03:21:29.190 --> 03:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
the full of the whole family and
 
03:21:33.670 --> 03:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:35.670 --> 03:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
this bill mo is
 
03:21:38.150 --> 03:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
to me this bill feels like we're taking
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
another step backwards
 
03:21:43.269 --> 03:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
it's again it's incarceration of these
 
03:21:45.269 --> 03:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
children and not looking
 
03:21:47.910 --> 03:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
to what we could be doing for them in
 
03:21:50.150 --> 03:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
their own communities
 
03:21:52.630 --> 03:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
with community-based services
 
03:21:56.229 --> 03:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
i do not see this bill as it is written
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
um to move us any closer to providing
 
03:22:01.110 --> 03:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
for care for children in the least
 
03:22:02.790 --> 03:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment
 
03:22:05.110 --> 03:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
i know your committee has a huge
 
03:22:05.120 --> 03:22:06.790 align:start position:0%
i know your committee has a huge
undertaking

03:22:06.790 --> 03:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
undertaking
 
03:22:09.269 --> 03:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
that needs to happen i guess before five
 
03:22:11.429 --> 03:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
o'clock tonight
 
03:22:13.590 --> 03:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
you have so much information to work
 
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
with i hope that some of you have been
 
03:22:19.269 --> 03:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
able to look at the original bill
 
03:22:20.950 --> 03:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:22:22.950 --> 03:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
see some of the
 
03:22:25.269 --> 03:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
parts of that bill that
 
03:22:27.910 --> 03:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
are definitely would definitely move us
 
03:22:31.590 --> 03:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
towards caring for children in a much
 
03:22:34.389 --> 03:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
more less restrictive environment
 
03:22:36.070 --> 03:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:22:37.030 --> 03:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:22:39.269 --> 03:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
and then i think it will move on to the
 
03:22:41.429 --> 03:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
finance committee where i think there
 
03:22:43.670 --> 03:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
are a number of financial questions
 
03:22:45.990 --> 03:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
about this bill it the way it came back
 
03:22:48.389 --> 03:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
from the senate it seems like it's
 
03:22:48.399 --> 03:22:49.429 align:start position:0%
from the senate it seems like it's
um

03:22:49.429 --> 03:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:51.030 --> 03:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
there are just so many questions to be
 
03:22:53.429 --> 03:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
answered around the finances of it
 
03:22:55.030 --> 03:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm glad to answer any
 
03:22:56.710 --> 03:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
questions if i can are there any
 
03:22:56.720 --> 03:22:59.349 align:start position:0%
questions if i can are there any
questions

03:22:59.349 --> 03:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
great seeing them thank you so much
 
03:23:03.910 --> 03:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
and last but not least i am not
 
03:23:06.950 --> 03:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
accepting any more pink cards on this
 
03:23:06.960 --> 03:23:07.830 align:start position:0%
accepting any more pink cards on this
bill

03:23:07.830 --> 03:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:23:09.990 --> 03:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
is keith keane to speak for two minutes
 
03:23:11.429 --> 03:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill
 
03:23:12.790 --> 03:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
madam chairman represent committee my
 
03:23:14.469 --> 03:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
name is keith kinning i'm the uh
 
03:23:16.150 --> 03:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
advocate director at waypoint i know you
 
03:23:17.429 --> 03:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
want to eat and i want to get to my car
 
03:23:18.550 --> 03:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
before i get a ticket so i'm going to
 
03:23:20.950 --> 03:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
make this really really fast um a couple
 
03:23:22.469 --> 03:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
things i want to make it clear that
 
03:23:24.229 --> 03:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
juvenile reform project doesn't support
 
03:23:26.229 --> 03:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
putting one child in a locked facility
 
03:23:28.790 --> 03:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
that doesn't belong there but
 
03:23:29.990 --> 03:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
there are some children that are
 
03:23:31.269 --> 03:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
dangerous to themselves or to the
 
03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
community that need to be in a locked
 
03:23:35.110 --> 03:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
facility and i will tell you whether you
 
03:23:36.870 --> 03:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
have this state build it or if a
 
03:23:39.030 --> 03:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
non-profit builds it because of priya
 
03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
which you guys understand because of
 
03:23:43.670 --> 03:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
certain children that are certified as
 
03:23:45.510 --> 03:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
an adult you are going to have to have a
 
03:23:47.670 --> 03:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
locked facility in this state so you
 
03:23:49.830 --> 03:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get around that
 
03:23:51.349 --> 03:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
i think it's unfair
 
03:23:54.389 --> 03:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
to continue to call it a mini sununu any
 
03:23:56.550 --> 03:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
more than it's unfair to call it a mini
 
03:23:59.670 --> 03:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
granite pathways um let's not forget the
 
03:24:01.750 --> 03:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
state invested two million dollars in
 
03:24:04.710 --> 03:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
granite pathways
 
03:24:07.030 --> 03:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
ended up closing it under a year
 
03:24:09.590 --> 03:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
because children were sexually abused
 
03:24:11.429 --> 03:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
and three of them almost died at that
 
03:24:11.439 --> 03:24:12.630 align:start position:0%
and three of them almost died at that
facility

03:24:12.630 --> 03:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:24:12.640 --> 03:24:13.349 align:start position:0%
facility
so

03:24:13.349 --> 03:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:24:14.790 --> 03:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
i just think you need to keep that in
 
03:24:17.030 --> 03:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
mind as you're going forward and finally
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know we're non-profits but we're not
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
stupid um you know there's this idea
 
03:24:23.910 --> 03:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
that somehow out there we're just gonna
 
03:24:26.389 --> 03:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
have to pay any private facility
 
03:24:27.750 --> 03:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
just for the people they're taking care
 
03:24:30.150 --> 03:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
of it doesn't work that way if you ask a
 
03:24:32.309 --> 03:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
facility to make room for
 
03:24:34.469 --> 03:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
nine kids they're gonna have to staff
 
03:24:36.870 --> 03:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
for nine kids and whether one child is
 
03:24:38.469 --> 03:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
there or two children are there you
 
03:24:40.229 --> 03:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
still have to pay that amount of money
 
03:24:42.389 --> 03:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
and so i think there's a bit of a
 
03:24:44.710 --> 03:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
misnomer going on here that somehow
 
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
going to a private or you know facility
 
03:24:48.870 --> 03:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
is going to save so much more money um i
 
03:24:50.229 --> 03:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
just don't think that's true so i just
 
03:24:51.910 --> 03:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to make those four quick points
 
03:24:54.309 --> 03:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions are
 
03:24:57.030 --> 03:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
03:24:59.269 --> 03:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
all right so again thank you so much i

members of the committee for the record
 
03:33:00.550 --> 03:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
my name is becky whitley and i'm honored
 
03:33:03.030 --> 03:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
to serve senate district 15 including
 
03:33:04.710 --> 03:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
the communities of concord henniker
 
03:33:06.389 --> 03:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
hopkinton and warner
 
03:33:09.429 --> 03:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
so the bill before you senate bill 446
 
03:33:11.750 --> 03:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
as it was introduced established a child
 
03:33:13.750 --> 03:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
care workforce fund to provide grants to
 
03:33:15.990 --> 03:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
eligible child care programs
 
03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:16.870 align:start position:0%
eligible child care programs
for

03:33:16.870 --> 03:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:33:18.710 --> 03:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
workforce recruitment and retention
 
03:33:21.670 --> 03:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
bonus bonuses and benefits uh the bill
 
03:33:23.349 --> 03:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
originally made an appropriation to the
 
03:33:25.349 --> 03:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
fund for the purposes of establishing
 
03:33:27.590 --> 03:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
and administrating the grant but what
 
03:33:29.750 --> 03:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
you have before you is compromised
 
03:33:31.590 --> 03:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
language that we passed over in the
 
03:33:31.600 --> 03:33:32.790 align:start position:0%
language that we passed over in the
senate

03:33:32.790 --> 03:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
senate
 
03:33:34.790 --> 03:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
the bill maintains the important
 
03:33:36.790 --> 03:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
findings and purpose of the underlying
 
03:33:38.950 --> 03:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
bill but replaces the remainder of the
 
03:33:40.070 --> 03:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill with the directive to the
 
03:33:41.910 --> 03:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
so pursuant to the version you have
 
03:33:45.269 --> 03:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
before you the department is charged
 
03:33:48.229 --> 03:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
with developing a plan in consultation
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
with the advisory council on child care
 
03:33:52.710 --> 03:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
that plan is due june 30th
 
03:33:55.510 --> 03:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
and the plan is to foster sustainable
 
03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
child care work opportunities for
 
03:33:59.670 --> 03:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
working families and businesses and
 
03:34:01.190 --> 03:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
we're a little prescriptive in what the
 
03:34:04.229 --> 03:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
plan needs to do because of the robust
 
03:34:05.830 --> 03:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard in the senate about
 
03:34:08.790 --> 03:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
the importance to address the child care
 
03:34:11.030 --> 03:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
workforce which is the workforce behind
 
03:34:13.670 --> 03:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
the workforce so the plan must focus on
 
03:34:16.309 --> 03:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
strategies to rapidly increase
 
03:34:18.150 --> 03:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh recruitment and retention of staffing
 
03:34:20.630 --> 03:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
at child care facilities it must include
 
03:34:22.389 --> 03:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
consideration of recruitment and
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
retention bonus bonus and benefit
 
03:34:27.590 --> 03:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
programs for certain child care employee
 
03:34:30.309 --> 03:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
employers strategies to ensure a future
 
03:34:32.469 --> 03:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
workforce costs for facilities and
 
03:34:34.550 --> 03:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
strategies to increase access and
 
03:34:37.030 --> 03:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
affordability of child care for families
 
03:34:39.750 --> 03:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
statewide so this report is due june i
 
03:34:42.710 --> 03:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
think which will set us up nicely
 
03:34:46.309 --> 03:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
um for the use of potential remaining
 
03:34:48.229 --> 03:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
american rescue plan funds and then of
 
03:34:49.830 --> 03:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
course going into the next budget
 
03:34:52.389 --> 03:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
science cycle uh this committee is well
 
03:34:55.910 --> 03:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
aware that during the coven 19 pandemic
 
03:34:57.990 --> 03:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
we saw that the child care workforce
 
03:35:00.469 --> 03:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
truly is that workforce behind our new
 
03:35:02.950 --> 03:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire workforce working folks cannot
 
03:35:05.110 --> 03:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
go to work if they do not have child
 
03:35:07.429 --> 03:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
care so as a working mother myself i
 
03:35:09.670 --> 03:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
have experienced this issue myself in
 
03:35:11.830 --> 03:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
order and i think it's important to you
 
03:35:13.670 --> 03:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
know in order to protect the interests
 
03:35:15.510 --> 03:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
of our working families but also the
 
03:35:17.670 --> 03:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
interests of our businesses we heard
 
03:35:19.510 --> 03:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
over in the senate lots of testimony
 
03:35:21.590 --> 03:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
about how businesses are really
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
struggling for workers and what they
 
03:35:25.670 --> 03:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
hear from their workforce what they hear
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
from their workforce is that one of the
 
03:35:29.830 --> 03:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
barriers to going back to work and to
 
03:35:32.150 --> 03:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
staying at work is the availability of
 
03:35:35.190 --> 03:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
quality and affordable child care
 
03:35:36.950 --> 03:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
and then when you hear from our child
 
03:35:38.710 --> 03:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
care facilities the reason why they
 
03:35:40.870 --> 03:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
cannot keep their doors open the reason
 
03:35:43.110 --> 03:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
why they can't provide additional slots
 
03:35:45.110 --> 03:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
is because they don't have the workforce
 
03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
so you're going to hear a lot about that
 
03:35:46.399 --> 03:35:47.750 align:start position:0%
so you're going to hear a lot about that
today

03:35:47.750 --> 03:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:35:49.750 --> 03:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that this is an important
 
03:35:52.309 --> 03:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
first step to secure and stabilize uh
 
03:35:54.469 --> 03:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
our in and hopefully even grow our
 
03:35:56.710 --> 03:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
workforce to set us up for future
 
03:35:58.630 --> 03:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
success it's good for families it's good
 
03:35:59.830 --> 03:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
for business and it's good for our
 
03:36:01.269 --> 03:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
economy so thank you for your
 
03:36:02.630 --> 03:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
consideration i'm happy to take
 
03:36:03.910 --> 03:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
questions but there are plenty more
 
03:36:06.309 --> 03:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
experts behind me
 
03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
03:36:09.120 --> 03:36:10.229 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
right

03:36:10.229 --> 03:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:36:12.389 --> 03:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
i have a question sure do you really
 
03:36:14.309 --> 03:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
believe that this can be done by june
 
03:36:14.319 --> 03:36:15.670 align:start position:0%
believe that this can be done by june
30th

03:36:15.670 --> 03:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
30th
 
03:36:17.990 --> 03:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
well and i'll defer that to department
 
03:36:19.750 --> 03:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
of health and human services i will say
 
03:36:22.150 --> 03:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
that you know there is a lot of work
 
03:36:23.750 --> 03:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
going on in the state not only within
 
03:36:25.590 --> 03:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
dhhs but within the council for thriving
 
03:36:26.870 --> 03:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
children all these groups we know that

03:36:30.790 --> 03:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
place so i you know the bill as
 
03:36:32.150 --> 03:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
originally written i think was a good
 
03:36:33.910 --> 03:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
one and so they could just implement
 
03:36:35.269 --> 03:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
that plan
 
03:36:36.790 --> 03:36:36.800 align:start position:0%

03:37:34.070 --> 03:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
granite state employees and they're the
 
03:37:36.550 --> 03:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
reason we're here today because this is
 
03:37:36.560 --> 03:37:37.429 align:start position:0%
reason we're here today because this is
a

03:37:37.429 --> 03:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:37:40.229 --> 03:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
constant issue that we hear about from
 
03:37:40.239 --> 03:37:41.510 align:start position:0%
constant issue that we hear about from
employers

03:37:41.510 --> 03:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
employers
 
03:37:43.830 --> 03:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
they're either their inability to hire
 
03:37:47.030 --> 03:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
because of lack of child care options or
 
03:37:49.590 --> 03:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
their ability to keep employees because
 
03:37:51.429 --> 03:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
of child care options
 
03:37:51.439 --> 03:37:52.389 align:start position:0%
of child care options
so

03:37:52.389 --> 03:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:54.389 --> 03:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
we think it's a good idea to take a
 
03:37:56.389 --> 03:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
closer look at this there has been work
 
03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
done done on it i think there's
 
03:38:00.309 --> 03:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
more work that can be done and if
 
03:38:03.269 --> 03:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
nothing else it will raise this issue
 
03:38:06.950 --> 03:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
the way workforce housing
 
03:38:09.590 --> 03:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
became a more important issue uh from
 
03:38:11.910 --> 03:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
when we started working on that in 2008
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
back then no one really understood what
 
03:38:16.389 --> 03:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
workforce housing is now everybody does
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:38:19.830 --> 03:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
the lack of available and affordable
 
03:38:21.670 --> 03:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
child care is another issue that needs
 
03:38:23.750 --> 03:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
to be raised in public awareness that
 
03:38:25.429 --> 03:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony i hope you'll
 
03:38:27.269 --> 03:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
pass this bill
 
03:38:29.590 --> 03:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so i have one one quick
 
03:38:31.830 --> 03:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
question if you don't mind
 
03:38:31.840 --> 03:38:34.950 align:start position:0%
question if you don't mind
um

03:38:34.950 --> 03:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:37.110 --> 03:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
would this also look at the reasoning
 
03:38:40.070 --> 03:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
why child care is so expensive
 
03:38:44.950 --> 03:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
i um i believe it likely would um i
 
03:38:44.960 --> 03:38:46.150 align:start position:0%
i um i believe it likely would um i
think

03:38:46.150 --> 03:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:38:48.389 --> 03:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
my my impression is
 
03:38:50.550 --> 03:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
everybody understands why it's so
 
03:38:50.560 --> 03:38:51.910 align:start position:0%
everybody understands why it's so
expensive

03:38:51.910 --> 03:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
03:38:55.110 --> 03:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
the problem is not so much trying to
 
03:38:56.790 --> 03:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
understand why it's expensive it's
 
03:38:58.550 --> 03:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what to do about
 
03:38:58.560 --> 03:38:59.349 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what to do about
that

03:38:59.349 --> 03:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:39:00.389 --> 03:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:39:02.870 --> 03:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative belanger
 
03:39:04.469 --> 03:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you sir
 
03:39:05.750 --> 03:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
for being here today and providing your
 
03:39:05.760 --> 03:39:07.670 align:start position:0%
for being here today and providing your
testimony

03:39:07.670 --> 03:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:39:10.229 --> 03:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
prefacing this my question is i'm a
 
03:39:11.349 --> 03:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
business owner
 
03:39:13.910 --> 03:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
i i foster a very family-friendly
 
03:39:13.920 --> 03:39:14.870 align:start position:0%
i i foster a very family-friendly
friendly

03:39:14.870 --> 03:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
friendly
 
03:39:16.710 --> 03:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
um business
 
03:39:19.189 --> 03:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
i have had chauffeurs bring in their
 
03:39:21.269 --> 03:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
families while i even myself will watch
 
03:39:23.269 --> 03:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
their kiddos okay
 
03:39:23.279 --> 03:39:24.469 align:start position:0%
their kiddos okay
so

03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:26.790 --> 03:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
that's what i've done without government
 
03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
interference so
 
03:39:30.790 --> 03:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
with the 400 businesses that you
 
03:39:33.349 --> 03:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
represent what have they done without
 
03:39:34.630 --> 03:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
government interference because that
 
03:39:35.830 --> 03:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
should be the first thing that we should
 
03:39:37.189 --> 03:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
be considering
 
03:39:38.790 --> 03:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative well first of
 
03:39:40.950 --> 03:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
all i wouldn't characterize establishing
 
03:39:42.790 --> 03:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
this commission as government
 
03:39:45.030 --> 03:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
interference but i will tell you what
 
03:39:46.710 --> 03:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
some of our employers have done when
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to do so
 
03:39:51.910 --> 03:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
we've had employers excuse me just this
 
03:39:53.910 --> 03:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
isn't a commission i i'm confused on
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
where you're getting that from this this
 
03:39:58.950 --> 03:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
is this this is a this is a study
 
03:40:01.110 --> 03:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
kind of thing it's not
 
03:40:03.269 --> 03:40:03.279 align:start position:0%
i misunderstood the uh the building
 
03:40:04.550 --> 03:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:40:04.560 --> 03:40:05.349 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:40:05.349 --> 03:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:07.590 --> 03:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
some some of our businesses
 
03:40:08.950 --> 03:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
um have
 
03:40:11.349 --> 03:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
started their own child care facilities
 
03:40:14.189 --> 03:40:14.199 align:start position:0%
uh this is uh happening uh
 
03:40:16.950 --> 03:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
primarily with hospital members because
 
03:40:19.030 --> 03:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
they have the
 
03:40:22.150 --> 03:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
resources and the space and the ability
 
03:40:24.469 --> 03:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
to to do so but it's not
 
03:40:27.910 --> 03:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
exclusively it is um
 
03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
a significant
 
03:40:33.110 --> 03:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
expense for employers to take on but for
 
03:40:34.229 --> 03:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
those that
 
03:40:35.670 --> 03:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
that are
 
03:40:37.750 --> 03:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
either progressive thinking in terms of
 
03:40:39.830 --> 03:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
what their employees need or those who
 
03:40:42.150 --> 03:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
are doing it because they see no other
 
03:40:43.830 --> 03:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
options that is something that is
 
03:40:43.840 --> 03:40:47.269 align:start position:0%
options that is something that is
happening

03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:49.349 --> 03:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative aldshiller
 
03:40:50.950 --> 03:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:40:53.269 --> 03:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for being here today
 
03:40:53.279 --> 03:40:55.030 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for being here today
um

03:40:55.030 --> 03:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:58.630 --> 03:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
so mr dubo can you tell me of these 400
 
03:41:01.830 --> 03:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
employer members and also welcome to
 
03:41:03.510 --> 03:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
childhood family we're really thrilled
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
to have you here of your membership
 
03:41:08.389 --> 03:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
um do you have
 
03:41:12.550 --> 03:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
a contingency of child care providers
 
03:41:14.469 --> 03:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
those business owners as part of your
 
03:41:17.030 --> 03:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
membership and if you do
 
03:41:19.030 --> 03:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
what are they telling
 
03:41:21.670 --> 03:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
the your the group at large i want to
 
03:41:23.510 --> 03:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
make sure i understand you're asking do
 
03:41:25.269 --> 03:41:25.279 align:start position:0%
we have child care providers as a part
 
03:41:28.150 --> 03:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
of our membership exactly yeah we do not
 
03:41:30.229 --> 03:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's not that we're excluding them it's
 
03:41:31.910 --> 03:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
just um
 
03:41:33.990 --> 03:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
there is a cost associated with being a
 
03:41:36.389 --> 03:41:36.399 align:start position:0%
bi member and i think they have other
 
03:41:38.389 --> 03:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
things that are more critical for them
 
03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
to spend their resources on
 
03:41:43.510 --> 03:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
we we do however hear from them in in
 
03:41:45.830 --> 03:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
terms of we have a policy committee
 
03:41:47.750 --> 03:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
within the bia called the human
 
03:41:49.510 --> 03:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
resources and workforce development
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
committee and we frequently
 
03:41:55.429 --> 03:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
invite in as guests either advocates for
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh child care in general or from time to
 
03:42:00.469 --> 03:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
time people who actually run child care
 
03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
facilities to just talk about the
 
03:42:06.870 --> 03:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:09.349 --> 03:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
i think you may ask a follow-up question
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
so within your um hr and workforce
 
03:42:14.150 --> 03:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
development committee where you're you
 
03:42:16.070 --> 03:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
know bringing in i'm assuming
 
03:42:17.910 --> 03:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong these are like
 
03:42:20.150 --> 03:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
luncheon learns or your
 
03:42:20.160 --> 03:42:21.349 align:start position:0%
luncheon learns or your
business

03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:42:23.429 --> 03:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
your executive board members
 
03:42:26.630 --> 03:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
um when you're saying that like they're
 
03:42:28.150 --> 03:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
you're bringing in
 
03:42:30.710 --> 03:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
people who own ch own child care
 
03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
facilities to talk yeah it's it's more
 
03:42:36.469 --> 03:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
formal than luncheon learns it's less
 
03:42:38.870 --> 03:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
formal than the executive committee what
 
03:42:41.670 --> 03:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
it is is a monthly uh policy committee
 
03:42:44.389 --> 03:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
we start meeting in september and then
 
03:42:46.790 --> 03:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
we go through the legislative session
 
03:42:49.189 --> 03:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
it's made up entirely of members of the
 
03:42:53.349 --> 03:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
bia primarily those that work in
 
03:42:55.349 --> 03:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
human resources fields like human
 
03:42:58.710 --> 03:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
resources managers or vps but also
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
people who work in the healthcare
 
03:43:02.150 --> 03:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
industries and
 
03:43:03.990 --> 03:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
people who
 
03:43:06.389 --> 03:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
specialize in workforce development
 
03:43:06.399 --> 03:43:07.349 align:start position:0%
specialize in workforce development
um

03:43:07.349 --> 03:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:09.189 --> 03:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the committee is to look
 
03:43:11.510 --> 03:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
at bills like this and others affecting
 
03:43:12.870 --> 03:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
those areas
 
03:43:15.590 --> 03:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
and get input from our members about
 
03:43:18.070 --> 03:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
the efficacy of the legislation and
 
03:43:19.670 --> 03:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's sort of the initial step
 
03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
of how bia establishes policy
 
03:43:25.750 --> 03:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
last last follow-up okay thank you very
 
03:43:28.870 --> 03:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
much so uh i think what i'm mostly
 
03:43:30.550 --> 03:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
curious about because i know many of
 
03:43:31.670 --> 03:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
your members
 
03:43:35.429 --> 03:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
and um in my district we have
 
03:43:38.070 --> 03:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
a number of child care facilities and
 
03:43:40.309 --> 03:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
not a week goes by where i don't hear
 
03:43:42.630 --> 03:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
from either a child care facility
 
03:43:42.640 --> 03:43:44.070 align:start position:0%
from either a child care facility
or

03:43:44.070 --> 03:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:43:48.309 --> 03:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
people who work and need child care and
 
03:43:51.189 --> 03:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
there's disconnects in cost in
 
03:43:53.670 --> 03:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
availability particularly availability
 
03:43:55.189 --> 03:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering
 
03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'm really glad that the bia is taking
 
03:43:58.790 --> 03:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
an interest
 
03:44:01.910 --> 03:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
have you done your own research so far
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
and what are you bringing to the table
 
03:44:03.840 --> 03:44:04.790 align:start position:0%
and what are you bringing to the table
now

03:44:04.790 --> 03:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:44:06.630 --> 03:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
because you've been dealing i know that
 
03:44:08.150 --> 03:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
you have been dealing with this as an
 
03:44:10.710 --> 03:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
issue for a lot longer than this bill
 
03:44:14.790 --> 03:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
the perspective i get from our members
 
03:44:19.189 --> 03:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's more candidly it's more of an
 
03:44:21.910 --> 03:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
availability issue than a cost issue and
 
03:44:23.429 --> 03:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
i'll explain why
 
03:44:25.030 --> 03:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
you have to be a certain type of company
 
03:44:26.550 --> 03:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of your size you have to be a
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
certain type of company to to belong to
 
03:44:30.389 --> 03:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
the bia just because
 
03:44:32.229 --> 03:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
we're a membership organization so you
 
03:44:33.910 --> 03:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
have to be willing to
 
03:44:33.920 --> 03:44:35.030 align:start position:0%
have to be willing to
um

03:44:35.030 --> 03:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:36.950 --> 03:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
be willing to invest in an organization
 
03:44:38.950 --> 03:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
like that which is generally
 
03:44:41.750 --> 03:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh more well-established companies or
 
03:44:44.790 --> 03:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
companies that that are not struggling
 
03:44:46.630 --> 03:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
in order to meet payroll
 
03:44:49.750 --> 03:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
so in general those types of firms have
 
03:44:53.030 --> 03:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
better paying jobs for their employees
 
03:44:54.229 --> 03:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
so it's not
 
03:44:56.469 --> 03:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
from our perspective for our members
 
03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily a cost issue it's
 
03:45:00.150 --> 03:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
more an availability issue and i'll give
 
03:45:03.269 --> 03:45:03.279 align:start position:0%
you one quick example i have a colleague
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
whose name
 
03:45:07.189 --> 03:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
was david career he was a lobbyist here
 
03:45:08.870 --> 03:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
worked on energy and environmental
 
03:45:11.349 --> 03:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
issues in in the legislature
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
um you know none of us are going to get
 
03:45:15.590 --> 03:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
rich working at the bia but you know
 
03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
we're paid here either
 
03:45:21.269 --> 03:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
just saying here either yeah you know
 
03:45:23.269 --> 03:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
we're not scraping
 
03:45:23.279 --> 03:45:25.189 align:start position:0%
we're not scraping
either

03:45:25.189 --> 03:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:45:27.030 --> 03:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
and he had it while he was at the bi he
 
03:45:29.269 --> 03:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
had a little baby little baby girl and
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
about six months before
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
the the birth of that child they started
 
03:45:35.910 --> 03:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
looking around for
 
03:45:37.910 --> 03:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh child care opportunities because his
 
03:45:41.269 --> 03:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
wife also works um and they got put on
 
03:45:43.510 --> 03:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
waiting lists they live in newington and
 
03:45:45.269 --> 03:45:45.279 align:start position:0%
they you know went
 
03:45:45.279 --> 03:45:46.790 align:start position:0%
they you know went
25

03:45:46.790 --> 03:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
25
 
03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
square miles around looking for child
 
03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
care so he worked for me for about a
 
03:45:52.790 --> 03:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
year and a half and then he left he now
 
03:45:55.269 --> 03:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
works at eversource down in manchester
 
03:45:57.110 --> 03:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
from the time he started with me to the
 
03:45:58.550 --> 03:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
time he left
 
03:46:00.389 --> 03:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
he was still looking for a child care
 
03:46:02.150 --> 03:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity and they were doing what
 
03:46:04.150 --> 03:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
they needed to do to get by sometimes he
 
03:46:06.309 --> 03:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
would stay in work from home sometimes
 
03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
his wife would stay and work from home
 
03:46:10.229 --> 03:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes the in-laws were there but
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
that's how difficult it is for someone
 
03:46:19.670 --> 03:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:20.830 --> 03:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
are you
 
03:46:24.630 --> 03:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
upset are there any further questions
 
03:46:27.349 --> 03:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
03:46:31.269 --> 03:46:31.279 align:start position:0%

03:46:35.199 --> 03:46:41.110 align:start position:0%
since we can support the bill for two
minutes

03:46:41.110 --> 03:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:43.750 --> 03:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much madam chair and

members of the committee for the record
 
03:46:47.349 --> 03:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
my name is henry valu
 
03:46:48.950 --> 03:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm here on behalf of the new
 
03:46:52.150 --> 03:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire alliance of ymcas
 
03:46:53.750 --> 03:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
if you take all the
 
03:46:56.229 --> 03:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
different y facilities around the state
 
03:46:59.590 --> 03:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
manchester nashua concord keene
 
03:47:02.309 --> 03:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
seacoast londonderry
 
03:47:04.550 --> 03:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
and you add them all together we're one
 
03:47:07.269 --> 03:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
of the largest child care providers
 
03:47:09.110 --> 03:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
in the state and
 
03:47:11.910 --> 03:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
we certainly experience
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
the trials and tribulations that this
 
03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to address
 
03:47:19.349 --> 03:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
the bill as introduced in the senate was
 
03:47:22.150 --> 03:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
a pretty comprehensive bill uh which ran
 
03:47:23.830 --> 03:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
into some glitches and
 
03:47:27.830 --> 03:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
um so we uh supported senator bradley uh
 
03:47:29.670 --> 03:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
who chairs the um
 
03:47:32.070 --> 03:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
senate health human services committee
 
03:47:34.550 --> 03:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh sort of put together the version that
 
03:47:36.630 --> 03:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
you have before you today
 
03:47:38.150 --> 03:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
which basically is going to get the
 
03:47:39.750 --> 03:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
right parties together
 
03:47:41.990 --> 03:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
um to try to put together a plan and i
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
think a lot of the work has been done
 
03:47:46.790 --> 03:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
already um so there are pieces that can
 
03:47:48.229 --> 03:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
be taken so
 
03:47:50.070 --> 03:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know i'm i'm somewhat optimistic
 
03:47:51.590 --> 03:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
that by june 30
 
03:47:53.990 --> 03:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
um the parties can get agreement on
 
03:47:56.950 --> 03:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
something uh it would then be presented
 
03:47:59.110 --> 03:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
to the legislature
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
probably through the
 
03:48:03.750 --> 03:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the fiscal committee um
 
03:48:06.710 --> 03:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
and uh have some legislative review uh
 
03:48:08.710 --> 03:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
in that regard too so
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
but we are strong support of the bill
 
03:48:12.830 --> 03:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
and happy to take any
 
03:48:15.910 --> 03:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
03:48:20.710 --> 03:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
up next is karen hebert
 
03:48:25.990 --> 03:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:28.630 --> 03:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is karen hebert i
 
03:48:29.990 --> 03:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
am the director for the division of
 
03:48:32.070 --> 03:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
economic and housing stability for the
 
03:48:35.670 --> 03:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
03:48:38.070 --> 03:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
so this particular bill is essentially
 
03:48:40.150 --> 03:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
to create a plan
 
03:48:43.510 --> 03:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
that would identify sustainable
 
03:48:46.229 --> 03:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
solutions to strengthen the child care
 
03:48:46.239 --> 03:48:48.389 align:start position:0%
solutions to strengthen the child care
profession

03:48:48.389 --> 03:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
profession
 
03:48:51.110 --> 03:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
what we need is a multi-faceted approach
 
03:48:54.070 --> 03:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
to try to strengthen that profession so
 
03:48:57.269 --> 03:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
the department has been already
 
03:48:57.279 --> 03:48:58.790 align:start position:0%
the department has been already
initiated

03:48:58.790 --> 03:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
initiated
 
03:49:01.110 --> 03:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
meetings with the child care advisory
 
03:49:03.110 --> 03:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
council i'm encouraged by those
 
03:49:03.120 --> 03:49:05.349 align:start position:0%
council i'm encouraged by those
conversations

03:49:05.349 --> 03:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
we will continue to meet i am optimistic
 
03:49:09.750 --> 03:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
that we will be able to meet the june
 
03:49:12.870 --> 03:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:15.030 --> 03:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
the child care
 
03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
the bureau of child development and head
 
03:49:18.150 --> 03:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
start collaboration is one of the
 
03:49:20.070 --> 03:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
bureaus that i oversee that has been
 
03:49:22.150 --> 03:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
working tirelessly
 
03:49:25.510 --> 03:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
on a three-phased approach to strengthen
 
03:49:27.830 --> 03:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
the child care profession and this is
 
03:49:30.389 --> 03:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
all as a result of the pandemic the
 
03:49:32.229 --> 03:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
first phase that we engaged in was
 
03:49:33.670 --> 03:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
really about
 
03:49:36.070 --> 03:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
the emergency response
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
the second phase was all about recovery
 
03:49:40.150 --> 03:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
and stabilization
 
03:49:42.070 --> 03:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
we are now in that third phase where
 
03:49:43.349 --> 03:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
we're looking at long-term
 
03:49:43.359 --> 03:49:44.950 align:start position:0%
we're looking at long-term
sustainability

03:49:44.950 --> 03:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
sustainability
 
03:49:47.349 --> 03:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
long-term stabilization and capacity
 
03:49:47.359 --> 03:49:48.469 align:start position:0%
long-term stabilization and capacity
building

03:49:48.469 --> 03:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:49:51.110 --> 03:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
for the industry for the profession when
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
i say long term that doesn't necessarily
 
03:49:53.279 --> 03:49:54.870 align:start position:0%
i say long term that doesn't necessarily
mean

03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
mean
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
initiatives that would take a long time
 
03:49:59.990 --> 03:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
to get to it includes
 
03:50:02.790 --> 03:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
what we use the word rapidly
 
03:50:04.469 --> 03:50:04.479 align:start position:0%
there are some ideas that we're already
 
03:50:08.150 --> 03:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
discussing to address a rapid response
 
03:50:11.910 --> 03:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
as a result of this particular bill
 
03:50:13.830 --> 03:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
what the long term essentially means is
 
03:50:13.840 --> 03:50:15.189 align:start position:0%
what the long term essentially means is
sustainable

03:50:15.189 --> 03:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
sustainable
 
03:50:17.510 --> 03:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
what are the sustainable solutions that
 
03:50:19.990 --> 03:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
will help child care providers perhaps
 
03:50:22.550 --> 03:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
help them to increase
 
03:50:24.550 --> 03:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
wages and earnings of
 
03:50:26.389 --> 03:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
their workforce
 
03:50:28.229 --> 03:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to answer any questions you
 
03:50:30.150 --> 03:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
may have
 
03:50:32.550 --> 03:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:38.550 --> 03:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for taking my question
 
03:50:38.560 --> 03:50:39.590 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for taking my question
um

03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:42.469 --> 03:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
so we've seen a lot of young families
 
03:50:44.469 --> 03:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
entering into new hampshire and part of
 
03:50:46.309 --> 03:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
the problem is finding
 
03:50:49.670 --> 03:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
child care for their kids uh would you
 
03:50:49.680 --> 03:50:50.469 align:start position:0%
child care for their kids uh would you
see

03:50:50.469 --> 03:50:50.479 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:50:52.950 --> 03:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
the outcome of this benefiting those
 
03:50:54.790 --> 03:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
young families entering in so that way
 
03:50:58.070 --> 03:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
they can find an easier access to that
 
03:50:59.910 --> 03:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
the intent is to
 
03:51:01.510 --> 03:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
to do just that i mean really
 
03:51:03.590 --> 03:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
strengthening the entire industry
 
03:51:05.990 --> 03:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
strengthening the profession so that we
 
03:51:08.389 --> 03:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
can accommodate people who need child
 
03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
care including the employer community so
 
03:51:13.510 --> 03:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
one of the ideas of course is being able
 
03:51:15.590 --> 03:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
to partner more with the employer
 
03:51:21.510 --> 03:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:21.520 --> 03:51:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:51:24.790 --> 03:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:26.150 --> 03:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i have a
 
03:51:27.510 --> 03:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
clarifying question you had just
 
03:51:29.429 --> 03:51:29.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned um and thank you very thank
 
03:51:31.189 --> 03:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
you very much i'm sorry i'm just leaping
 
03:51:32.309 --> 03:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
right ahead
 
03:51:33.590 --> 03:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
um when you were talking about the
 
03:51:35.670 --> 03:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
three-phase approach to strengthening
 
03:51:37.510 --> 03:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
child care in new hampshire is that a
 
03:51:39.910 --> 03:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
report that a committee put together
 
03:51:41.590 --> 03:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
that's already available
 
03:51:43.510 --> 03:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
i would be more than happy to share that
 
03:51:45.269 --> 03:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
with you yes yes what was the name of
 
03:51:47.510 --> 03:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
that commitment was in my notes i i know
 
03:51:49.990 --> 03:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
you said that there was a group that
 
03:51:51.830 --> 03:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
evaluated those that three-phase
 
03:51:53.990 --> 03:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
approach it's the the bureau of child
 
03:51:55.670 --> 03:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
development and head start collaboration
 
03:51:58.150 --> 03:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the speaker is in our way no
 
03:51:58.160 --> 03:51:59.269 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the speaker is in our way no
worries

03:51:59.269 --> 03:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
worries
 
03:52:01.429 --> 03:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
um which is a bureau that i oversee in
 
03:52:05.670 --> 03:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
the bureau of child development and head
 
03:52:11.110 --> 03:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
start collaboration thank you yes
 
03:52:13.590 --> 03:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
just a long it is a long title
 
03:52:17.110 --> 03:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
and may a follow-up match and so um this
 
03:52:19.670 --> 03:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
working group
 
03:52:21.590 --> 03:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
already has um
 
03:52:24.630 --> 03:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
you've already put together
 
03:52:26.389 --> 03:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
some data that could
 
03:52:26.399 --> 03:52:27.590 align:start position:0%
some data that could
inform

03:52:27.590 --> 03:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
inform
 
03:52:30.389 --> 03:52:30.399 align:start position:0%
this this uh the
 
03:52:32.389 --> 03:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
what this bill is asking for by the june
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
30th deadline we do have some data and i
 
03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
think that it's important that we try to
 
03:52:39.110 --> 03:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
identify other data sets that are
 
03:52:39.120 --> 03:52:40.389 align:start position:0%
identify other data sets that are
available

03:52:40.389 --> 03:52:40.399 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:52:42.870 --> 03:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
so that we can really make an informed
 
03:52:44.630 --> 03:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
decision for the legislature going
 
03:52:46.550 --> 03:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
forward sure
 
03:52:49.510 --> 03:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
um last follow-up so i guess what i'm
 
03:52:51.349 --> 03:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
what i'm driving at is you're not you're
 
03:52:52.950 --> 03:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
not reinventing the wheel now you
 
03:52:54.309 --> 03:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
already have stuff that you're working
 
03:52:56.790 --> 03:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
on and you know what you need to find
 
03:52:56.800 --> 03:52:57.590 align:start position:0%
on and you know what you need to find
so

03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:53:00.070 --> 03:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's correct yes awesome so june 30th
 
03:53:02.870 --> 03:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
is not a daunting deadline necessarily
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
no ma'am awesome thank you
 
03:53:09.510 --> 03:53:09.520 align:start position:0%

cowell from early learning new hampshire
 
03:53:28.309 --> 03:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
we're a statewide non-profit that works
 
03:53:29.349 --> 03:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
to help
 
03:53:31.269 --> 03:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
child care programs do their work as
 
03:53:33.189 --> 03:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
this the workforce and the families they
 
03:53:33.199 --> 03:53:34.070 align:start position:0%
this the workforce and the families they
serve

03:53:34.070 --> 03:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
serve
 
03:53:35.030 --> 03:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:53:37.429 --> 03:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
just here briefly to point out that we
 
03:53:39.189 --> 03:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
are in support of this bipartisan
 
03:53:41.910 --> 03:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
amendment it um passed as a bipartisan
 
03:53:44.630 --> 03:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
amendment to again go for the pro go
 
03:53:47.750 --> 03:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
from an appropriation from gopher state
 
03:53:50.070 --> 03:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
discretionary funds to a plan
 
03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
to do that and we are in support of that
 
03:53:54.469 --> 03:53:54.479 align:start position:0%
we do hope the legislature in the house
 
03:53:56.229 --> 03:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
will also agree
 
03:53:58.229 --> 03:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
to support this
 
03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
development of a plan by dhhs in
 
03:54:02.950 --> 03:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
consultation with the new hampshire
 
03:54:04.870 --> 03:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
child care advisory council you'll hear
 
03:54:06.790 --> 03:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
from some of their leadership here it's
 
03:54:08.950 --> 03:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
a legislatively enacted group
 
03:54:10.790 --> 03:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
to advise the department so we do
 
03:54:13.750 --> 03:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
believe it's very important to have this
 
03:54:16.630 --> 03:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
plan about how to to increase the
 
03:54:19.590 --> 03:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
retention and recruitment and have it
 
03:54:21.990 --> 03:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
again as a bipartisan came through the
 
03:54:24.070 --> 03:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
senate it'd be great to have the house
 
03:54:26.150 --> 03:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
also put their
 
03:54:27.990 --> 03:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
stamp on it and say we we think this
 
03:54:29.510 --> 03:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
plan should happen as well i think that
 
03:54:31.910 --> 03:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
will be very important i brought with me
 
03:54:31.920 --> 03:54:33.189 align:start position:0%
will be very important i brought with me
simply

03:54:33.189 --> 03:54:33.199 align:start position:0%

03:54:40.710 --> 03:54:40.720 align:start position:0%

in support of the bill for two minutes
 
03:56:00.630 --> 03:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm mary ann barter
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
i'm the chair of the child care advisory
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
council um and i'm in support of the
 
03:56:08.630 --> 03:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
child care advisory council is in
 
03:56:10.710 --> 03:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
support of this bill i just want to take
 
03:56:12.630 --> 03:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
a couple of minutes to explain why this
 
03:56:14.550 --> 03:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
bill is so important the funding that
 
03:56:16.309 --> 03:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
has gone to child care facilities for
 
03:56:17.910 --> 03:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years has helped
 
03:56:19.910 --> 03:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
stabilize individual agencies and
 
03:56:23.990 --> 03:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
programs but this but this bill presents
 
03:56:25.750 --> 03:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
child care without borders it's really
 
03:56:28.710 --> 03:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to keep the workforce in
 
03:56:30.389 --> 03:56:30.399 align:start position:0%
the workforce so that if there's a
 
03:56:32.790 --> 03:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
reason why a child care provider chooses
 
03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
to leave their center or their program
 
03:56:36.790 --> 03:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
they're incentivized to go to another
 
03:56:39.590 --> 03:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
child care program or agency rather than
 
03:56:41.910 --> 03:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
target or dunkin donuts or something
 
03:56:44.469 --> 03:56:44.479 align:start position:0%
else or retail establishment it's really
 
03:56:46.309 --> 03:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
to incentivize people to stay in the
 
03:56:48.630 --> 03:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
field until things can improve and i
 
03:56:50.870 --> 03:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
think we all truly believe that things
 
03:56:53.110 --> 03:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
will improve but it will get it will
 
03:56:55.670 --> 03:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
take time um three years from now i
 
03:56:57.110 --> 03:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
think the child care
 
03:56:59.670 --> 03:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
industry will be well on its way to
 
03:57:02.630 --> 03:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
sustainability and some practices that
 
03:57:04.469 --> 03:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
will really incentivize people to enter
 
03:57:06.550 --> 03:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
the field and stay there but we are not
 
03:57:08.309 --> 03:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
there yet so we need to maintain our
 
03:57:11.349 --> 03:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
workforce until we can get there
 
03:57:13.429 --> 03:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is truly
 
03:57:15.349 --> 03:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
important about this bill right now is
 
03:57:17.590 --> 03:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
that maine recently
 
03:57:19.910 --> 03:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
put in their budget 12 million dollars
 
03:57:21.510 --> 03:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
worth of incentives for child care
 
03:57:23.910 --> 03:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
providers and massachusetts is looking
 
03:57:25.750 --> 03:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
at 60 million dollars worth of incentive
 
03:57:27.110 --> 03:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
for child care
 
03:57:29.510 --> 03:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
providers the individual teachers
 
03:57:32.229 --> 03:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
we want to maintain our workforce
 
03:57:33.910 --> 03:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
and we also want to make sure that our
 
03:57:36.229 --> 03:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
workforce stays in new hampshire the
 
03:57:37.910 --> 03:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
last thing we want is for the very
 
03:57:39.510 --> 03:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
talented people that we have who are
 
03:57:40.710 --> 03:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
willing to continue working in this
 
03:57:42.790 --> 03:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
field decide to drive to mainer
 
03:57:45.429 --> 03:57:45.439 align:start position:0%
massachusetts to do it so this is truly
 
03:57:45.439 --> 03:57:46.469 align:start position:0%
massachusetts to do it so this is truly
important

03:57:46.469 --> 03:57:46.479 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:57:49.030 --> 03:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
um and i'd also like to say that i agree
 
03:57:51.910 --> 03:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
with karen hebert our colleague at dhhs
 
03:57:53.670 --> 03:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
the child care advisory council is very
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
optimistic that we will be able to meet
 
03:57:57.670 --> 03:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
the june 30th deadline but i do believe
 
03:58:00.070 --> 03:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
that passing this bill will ensure that
 
03:58:02.550 --> 03:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
we meet the june 30th deadline
 
03:58:03.830 --> 03:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
and that's all
 
03:58:06.790 --> 03:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
03:58:07.990 --> 03:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
03:58:10.550 --> 03:58:10.560 align:start position:0%

03:58:11.990 --> 03:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
mcmurphy
 
03:58:13.590 --> 03:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the bill for two
 
03:58:22.550 --> 03:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:25.189 --> 03:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thanks to the
 
03:58:28.389 --> 03:58:28.399 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing me to testify
 
03:58:31.910 --> 03:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
i got into child care not out of passion
 
03:58:31.920 --> 03:58:33.189 align:start position:0%
i got into child care not out of passion
um

03:58:33.189 --> 03:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:35.750 --> 03:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
i was in business
 
03:58:37.830 --> 03:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
for the first 25 years of my career and
 
03:58:39.990 --> 03:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
then i was serving on a board
 
03:58:41.830 --> 03:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
asked to serve on a board at white birch
 
03:58:43.590 --> 03:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
center and
 
03:58:45.429 --> 03:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
i ended up becoming the executive
 
03:58:47.510 --> 03:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
director and my passion has grown quite
 
03:58:50.389 --> 03:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:51.990 --> 03:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
with all the business experience that i
 
03:58:55.349 --> 03:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
have and and having an mba i was able to
 
03:58:57.750 --> 03:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
do a lot of work at white birch to get
 
03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
our finances organized and do all of the
 
03:59:03.189 --> 03:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
proper budgeting that any business
 
03:59:05.349 --> 03:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
should do and
 
03:59:08.229 --> 03:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
having done all of that um why is child
 
03:59:10.150 --> 03:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
care expensive what's i heard you asked
 
03:59:12.790 --> 03:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
that madam chair
 
03:59:12.800 --> 03:59:13.990 align:start position:0%
that madam chair
it

03:59:13.990 --> 03:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:59:16.870 --> 03:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
it has to be even more expensive really
 
03:59:19.269 --> 03:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
to make it work for long-term stability
 
03:59:20.710 --> 03:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
because otherwise
 
03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
you just can't pay the workforce what
 
03:59:24.309 --> 03:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
you need to pay
 
03:59:26.469 --> 03:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
for them to turn it into a career
 
03:59:26.479 --> 03:59:27.269 align:start position:0%
for them to turn it into a career
and

03:59:27.269 --> 03:59:27.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:29.510 --> 03:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
to be stable and unlike
 
03:59:31.830 --> 03:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
um some other options if uh if a
 
03:59:34.550 --> 03:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
restaurant is short on labor
 
03:59:37.189 --> 03:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
in our town of henniker great town
 
03:59:38.630 --> 03:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
there's a few other restaurants so if
 
03:59:40.229 --> 03:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
they're closed on tuesdays you can go to
 
03:59:41.670 --> 03:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
another restaurant but with child care
 
03:59:43.110 --> 03:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's not an option
 
03:59:45.750 --> 03:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
for a lot of families and to stabilize
 
03:59:47.269 --> 03:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
the workforce
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
and to keep them in place and to have a
 
03:59:52.150 --> 03:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
place for working families
 
03:59:54.870 --> 03:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
this bill which i support uh
 
03:59:56.630 --> 03:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
takes steps in that direction and i
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
think that's really healthy not just for
 
04:00:00.389 --> 04:00:00.399 align:start position:0%
working families but for the economy i'd
 
04:00:01.429 --> 04:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
love to see
 
04:00:03.590 --> 04:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
the economy stay strong in new hampshire
 
04:00:06.309 --> 04:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
and not have it falter
 
04:00:08.389 --> 04:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
i know housing is an issue but child
 
04:00:10.550 --> 04:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
care is also a very big issue and this
 
04:00:14.070 --> 04:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:17.110 --> 04:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
04:00:19.269 --> 04:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
and then thank you so much
 
04:00:22.469 --> 04:00:22.479 align:start position:0%

i miss the days
 
04:00:46.229 --> 04:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
of classrooms full of children and
 
04:00:48.469 --> 04:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
meeting new families as they come to
 
04:00:50.070 --> 04:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
tour our center in hopes of being able
 
04:00:52.309 --> 04:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
to enroll their child little blessings
 
04:00:54.229 --> 04:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
has always had the reputation for long
 
04:00:57.510 --> 04:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
wait lists because of our wonderful care
 
04:00:59.269 --> 04:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately now we have long wait
 
04:01:01.510 --> 04:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
lists because we don't have staff
 
04:01:03.510 --> 04:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
these days i walk by dark in classrooms
 
04:01:05.510 --> 04:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
where children were once happily engaged
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
in fun learning activities
 
04:01:09.189 --> 04:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
mornings are spent hoping that nobody's
 
04:01:11.750 --> 04:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
called out or and rearranging schedules
 
04:01:13.910 --> 04:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
in order to meet state ratios
 
04:01:16.630 --> 04:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
our enrollment is down by 60 percent we
 
04:01:18.309 --> 04:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to enroll any new
 
04:01:20.150 --> 04:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
families in our program in over a year
 
04:01:22.710 --> 04:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
due to staffing we're barely making room
 
04:01:25.429 --> 04:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
for new siblings of our older children
 
04:01:27.750 --> 04:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
without staff we can't open classrooms
 
04:01:30.309 --> 04:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
without staff we can't enroll children
 
04:01:32.070 --> 04:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
without staff we cannot meet the needs
 
04:01:33.990 --> 04:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
of families who desperately are looking
 
04:01:35.189 --> 04:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
for care
 
04:01:36.870 --> 04:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
when i first started at little blessings
 
04:01:39.269 --> 04:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
we had roughly 25 staff
 
04:01:40.950 --> 04:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
full and part-time
 
04:01:43.349 --> 04:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
we currently have 12 and only four of
 
04:01:45.830 --> 04:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
those are qualified teachers we're
 
04:01:47.510 --> 04:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
thankful for every day we don't have to
 
04:01:49.349 --> 04:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
close another classroom or lose another
 
04:01:50.790 --> 04:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
staff member
 
04:01:52.710 --> 04:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
the effects of the pandemic continue to
 
04:01:54.630 --> 04:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
hit hard the past two years have been a
 
04:01:56.469 --> 04:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
roller coaster ride and not the happy
 
04:01:57.750 --> 04:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
fun one
 
04:01:59.830 --> 04:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
this one's white knuckle dark scary
 
04:02:01.590 --> 04:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
loop-de-loop ride with twists and turns
 
04:02:03.030 --> 04:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
you can't see coming
 
04:02:05.110 --> 04:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
directors and teachers are exhausted
 
04:02:07.590 --> 04:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
emotionally mentally and physically it's
 
04:02:09.030 --> 04:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
a struggle to put your whole heart and
 
04:02:11.110 --> 04:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
soul in your career every day only to be
 
04:02:12.389 --> 04:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
left feeling like you're on your own
 
04:02:14.150 --> 04:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
little island and nobody speaks your
 
04:02:14.160 --> 04:02:15.189 align:start position:0%
little island and nobody speaks your
language

04:02:15.189 --> 04:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:02:17.429 --> 04:02:17.439 align:start position:0%
this bill has not come at a better time
 
04:02:19.429 --> 04:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
we cannot afford to lose any more valued
 
04:02:21.510 --> 04:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
teachers in fact this bill has the
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
ability to strengthen and rebuild new
 
04:02:26.150 --> 04:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire's child care workforce
 
04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
i've been getting calls from hr
 
04:02:29.110 --> 04:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
departments who are looking to hire
 
04:02:31.269 --> 04:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
candidates but that person cannot find
 
04:02:33.349 --> 04:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
child care and therefore cannot accept
 
04:02:34.469 --> 04:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
the position
 
04:02:36.070 --> 04:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
every day we have an average of six to
 
04:02:37.750 --> 04:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
eight calls or emails from parents
 
04:02:39.830 --> 04:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
desperately looking for child care we
 
04:02:41.269 --> 04:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
must tell them that we don't have any
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
idea when we will have an opening as it
 
04:02:46.070 --> 04:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
all depends on being able to find hire
 
04:02:49.110 --> 04:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
and retain staff we need this bill new
 
04:02:50.790 --> 04:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire's child care industry needs
 
04:02:52.950 --> 04:02:52.960 align:start position:0%

hoppy
 
04:03:09.189 --> 04:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
happy to speak for two minutes from the
 
04:03:13.429 --> 04:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:15.990 --> 04:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate your guys time
 
04:03:17.910 --> 04:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm corlyn hoppy i'm the executive
 
04:03:20.229 --> 04:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
director of rochester child care center
 
04:03:21.910 --> 04:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
i'm a newbie i've only been doing this
 
04:03:24.070 --> 04:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
for seven months but i have my master's
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
degree and i understand the business
 
04:03:25.439 --> 04:03:26.309 align:start position:0%
degree and i understand the business
world

04:03:26.309 --> 04:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
world
 
04:03:28.550 --> 04:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
i work to collaborate with many outside
 
04:03:30.070 --> 04:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
industries to make sure that we offer
 
04:03:32.870 --> 04:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
care but at this point i have 40 babies
 
04:03:35.030 --> 04:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
to toddlers on our wait list
 
04:03:37.510 --> 04:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
i have 90 employees under me
 
04:03:39.990 --> 04:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
and we're still not able to pay them or
 
04:03:42.389 --> 04:03:42.399 align:start position:0%
compete with any under industry i give
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
our lead teachers have bachelor's degree
 
04:03:47.670 --> 04:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
between 17 and 22 dollars an hour
 
04:03:49.670 --> 04:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire rent is
 
04:03:52.469 --> 04:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
1400 a month if you are not married like
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
myself with an electrician i'm not able
 
04:03:57.269 --> 04:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
to work or be able to stay in this field
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
so as an agency we're okay and we are
 
04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
going to make it
 
04:04:03.269 --> 04:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
but we've had three other centers closed
 
04:04:04.950 --> 04:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
down right near us
 
04:04:07.670 --> 04:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
so beginning the beginning of may
 
04:04:09.110 --> 04:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
our wait list will probably jump up
 
04:04:10.950 --> 04:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
between 60 and 70.
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
so we're already at the point of chaos
 
04:04:15.429 --> 04:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
and we want to come to you as a point of
 
04:04:17.510 --> 04:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
an opportunity this is the first time
 
04:04:19.830 --> 04:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
you can really truly invest in families
 
04:04:22.389 --> 04:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
and children agencies like mine in order
 
04:04:25.349 --> 04:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
to keep our people here because we're
 
04:04:26.630 --> 04:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
going to get to a point that we run them
 
04:04:28.070 --> 04:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
all off and no one wants to hang out
 
04:04:28.080 --> 04:04:28.950 align:start position:0%
all off and no one wants to hang out
here

04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:04:30.790 --> 04:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
so i've talked to the mayor over in
 
04:04:32.630 --> 04:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
rochester and been involved in a lot of
 
04:04:34.150 --> 04:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
the rotary conversations about the
 
04:04:36.790 --> 04:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
building of the cities but i in another
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
child care center and a few small family
 
04:04:40.309 --> 04:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
child care centers are the only ones in
 
04:04:40.319 --> 04:04:41.670 align:start position:0%
child care centers are the only ones in
town

04:04:41.670 --> 04:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:04:43.030 --> 04:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure how much longer those
 
04:04:44.550 --> 04:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
other ones are going to make it
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
so the reason rochester child care works
 
04:04:49.750 --> 04:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
is because we have a large school age
 
04:04:52.309 --> 04:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
program our school age program offsets
 
04:04:54.150 --> 04:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
the cost of our early child care program
 
04:04:55.750 --> 04:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
which would put us into debt if we
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
didn't have
 
04:04:59.110 --> 04:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
not we're okay for early child care
 
04:05:01.030 --> 04:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
teachers right now in our actual agency
 
04:05:02.950 --> 04:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
but our school age program is suffering
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
and it's really that program that pays
 
04:05:06.550 --> 04:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
our teachers and for our administrative
 
04:05:09.590 --> 04:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
costs so we're at a point where just in
 
04:05:11.429 --> 04:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
constant putting out buyers
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
if you give us the opportunity to have
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
this plan and have real discussions with
 
04:05:18.150 --> 04:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
the state we might in turn be able to
 
04:05:19.750 --> 04:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
thrive again and really help the rest of
 
04:05:22.150 --> 04:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
our economy but for right now we're
 
04:05:24.070 --> 04:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
pinning parents against agencies we're
 
04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
competing with other child care
 
04:05:28.309 --> 04:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
industries indirectly because of two
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
hires i've shut down classrooms and
 
04:05:32.469 --> 04:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
other agencies
 
04:05:33.830 --> 04:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'm here
 
04:05:36.950 --> 04:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
in three different hats as a parent of
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
two children we're struggling to stay in
 
04:05:40.150 --> 04:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
this state
 
04:05:43.510 --> 04:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
as an executive director of an agency
 
04:05:45.750 --> 04:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
and as a person of
 
04:05:46.950 --> 04:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:05:49.510 --> 04:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
so if you could i i hope that you guys
 
04:05:50.870 --> 04:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
would just invest in our children and
 
04:05:52.229 --> 04:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
families and continue to help new
 
04:05:54.150 --> 04:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire stay
 
04:05:55.030 --> 04:05:55.040 align:start position:0%

thank you for having me um and thank you
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
for taking the time to listen to us
 
04:06:19.269 --> 04:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
you've heard from my colleagues we're
 
04:06:21.590 --> 04:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
all in the same boat um i'm in a center
 
04:06:25.110 --> 04:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
of 70 children i have a wait list of 77
 
04:06:27.910 --> 04:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
children i get daily calls from parents
 
04:06:29.910 --> 04:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
when will you know can i get a space how
 
04:06:31.429 --> 04:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
can i get in
 
04:06:33.349 --> 04:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
um it's horrible to have to tell a
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
parent i don't know
 
04:06:38.229 --> 04:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
we're short staffed i work a 13-hour day
 
04:06:40.389 --> 04:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
to support my staff
 
04:06:41.750 --> 04:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
and they don't make enough money to
 
04:06:43.510 --> 04:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
support themselves
 
04:06:46.229 --> 04:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
we've raised their their benefits we've
 
04:06:48.150 --> 04:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
raised their wages we're doing
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
everything we can but when you can go to
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
mcdonald's and make 25 an hour or 20 an
 
04:06:53.040 --> 04:06:54.950 align:start position:0%
mcdonald's and make 25 an hour or 20 an
hour

04:06:54.950 --> 04:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
hour
 
04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
and it's a little bit easier than having
 
04:06:59.429 --> 04:06:59.439 align:start position:0%
to sit with a bunch of children all day
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
these are our future
 
04:07:03.269 --> 04:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
these children are our future they're
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
our future workforce
 
04:07:07.670 --> 04:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
and if we can't support them and their
 
04:07:10.070 --> 04:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
families we won't have a workforce we
 
04:07:12.150 --> 04:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
won't have a future workforce
 
04:07:14.710 --> 04:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
and my colleagues and i will struggle to
 
04:07:14.720 --> 04:07:17.269 align:start position:0%
and my colleagues and i will struggle to
survive

04:07:17.269 --> 04:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:19.030 --> 04:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
we hope that you'll take this bill into
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
great consideration
 
04:07:23.189 --> 04:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire families need our help our
 
04:07:26.309 --> 04:07:26.319 align:start position:0%

she asked for i think three minutes i
 
04:08:25.269 --> 04:08:25.279 align:start position:0%

04:08:27.349 --> 04:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee excuse me
 
04:08:28.630 --> 04:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
my name is devin quinn and i'm coming
 
04:08:29.590 --> 04:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire women's
 
04:08:31.750 --> 04:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
foundation um in addition to the
 
04:08:33.590 --> 04:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
previous testimony before me i just
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to add to the discussion uh the
 
04:08:37.910 --> 04:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
specific impact the child care crisis
 
04:08:42.469 --> 04:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
has on women um women make up 86 of
 
04:08:44.149 --> 04:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
child care workers in industry in the
 
04:08:45.670 --> 04:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
field itself
 
04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
but among essential
 
04:08:50.149 --> 04:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
care work uh essential
 
04:08:53.110 --> 04:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
workforce it's 68
 
04:08:55.269 --> 04:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
that means women are the majority of
 
04:08:57.510 --> 04:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
social services health care grocery
 
04:09:00.550 --> 04:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
retail convenience stores and the thing
 
04:09:02.550 --> 04:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
about all those jobs is that
 
04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
they can't do it from home they can't do
 
04:09:06.630 --> 04:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
that work from home and when child care
 
04:09:09.110 --> 04:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
is an issue when they call out that's
 
04:09:10.710 --> 04:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
ripple effects throughout the entire
 
04:09:10.720 --> 04:09:12.149 align:start position:0%
ripple effects throughout the entire
economy

04:09:12.149 --> 04:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
economy
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
and certainly child care impacts a whole
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
family but we've seen during kovid when
 
04:09:20.950 --> 04:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
um most families for at some point lost
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh school or child care um it was
 
04:09:26.309 --> 04:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
actually four mothers were four to five
 
04:09:28.389 --> 04:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
times more likely to reduce their hours
 
04:09:29.910 --> 04:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
or completely
 
04:09:31.990 --> 04:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
leave the workforce to take care of
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
child care
 
04:09:36.950 --> 04:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
15 percent of new hampshire workers who
 
04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
would be in the workforce
 
04:09:39.910 --> 04:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
who are not
 
04:09:41.349 --> 04:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
cite child care
 
04:09:42.870 --> 04:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
issues as the main reason why they're
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
not in the workforce
 
04:09:47.910 --> 04:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
and when women leave the workforce they
 
04:09:49.189 --> 04:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
that is impacting their career
 
04:09:49.199 --> 04:09:50.389 align:start position:0%
that is impacting their career
trajectory

04:09:50.389 --> 04:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
trajectory
 
04:09:52.550 --> 04:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's impacting their financial security
 
04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh women have always been the backbone
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
of the workforce working outside the
 
04:10:01.750 --> 04:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
home working inside the home
 
04:10:03.670 --> 04:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
taking care of children inside the home
 
04:10:05.429 --> 04:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
and outside the home
 
04:10:07.750 --> 04:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
so this bill would not only support the
 
04:10:09.990 --> 04:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
economy and the sector but specifically
 
04:10:11.750 --> 04:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
women as well
 
04:10:12.710 --> 04:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:10:15.670 --> 04:10:15.680 align:start position:0%

04:14:32.469 --> 04:14:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:32.479 --> 04:15:03.429 align:start position:0%

04:18:45.600 --> 04:18:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:58.070 --> 04:18:58.080 align:start position:0%

04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
why don't you just do what other
 
04:19:12.870 --> 04:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
communities have done kim and say this
 
04:19:14.870 --> 04:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
was drafted in error
 
04:19:18.070 --> 04:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
that it i meant for it to say six
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
and if the committee is good with that
 
04:19:21.990 --> 04:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
then you can get the final performance
 
04:19:27.910 --> 04:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:27.920 --> 04:19:28.870 align:start position:0%

a bill
 
05:25:25.110 --> 05:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
i mean is that is there
 
05:25:28.310 --> 05:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
a need for having a bill to say make a
 
05:25:30.470 --> 05:25:30.480 align:start position:0%

to bring a plant to fiscal
 
05:25:34.470 --> 05:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps maybe it just holds their feet

okay

05:28:10.070 --> 05:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:28:10.080 --> 05:28:11.670 align:start position:0%
okay
so

05:28:11.670 --> 05:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:28:13.830 --> 05:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just waiting for the copies to
 
05:28:14.948 --> 05:28:14.958 align:start position:0%
come down
 
05:28:16.868 --> 05:28:16.878 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:28:16.878 --> 05:28:17.670 align:start position:0%
um so
the

05:28:17.670 --> 05:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:28:21.990 --> 05:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
um amendment that i put in puts 458 back
 
05:28:25.590 --> 05:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
in place adds sb 254 which were the
 
05:28:27.350 --> 05:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
condition reducing the conditions of
 
05:28:31.830 --> 05:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
confinement at sysc but it also
 
05:28:35.910 --> 05:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:38.788 --> 05:28:38.798 align:start position:0%
and the thinking is then the
 
05:28:41.110 --> 05:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
finance committee can negotiate up if
 
05:28:42.548 --> 05:28:42.558 align:start position:0%
they would like
 
05:28:45.270 --> 05:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
but i would really like a strong showing
 
05:28:47.590 --> 05:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
of support from this committee that we
 
05:28:50.150 --> 05:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
do not think it is okay to put kids in
 
05:28:50.160 --> 05:28:51.830 align:start position:0%
do not think it is okay to put kids in
jail

05:28:51.830 --> 05:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
jail
 
05:28:54.390 --> 05:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
but yet they'll still have a facility
 
05:28:58.708 --> 05:28:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:02.310 --> 05:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
did i explain that okay
 
05:29:04.548 --> 05:29:04.558 align:start position:0%
so i'm just waiting for that i do have i
 
05:29:06.150 --> 05:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
have copies of the amendment that say
 
05:29:08.070 --> 05:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
the 12 bed facility
 
05:29:10.070 --> 05:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
but um
 
05:29:11.590 --> 05:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
if you want to start looking at it but
 
05:29:14.830 --> 05:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
every 12 is going to be replaced with a
 
05:29:18.628 --> 05:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
6. so question for me yes so
 
05:29:22.948 --> 05:29:22.958 align:start position:0%
uh hospital 254 i'm our um
 
05:29:24.868 --> 05:29:24.878 align:start position:0%
what what's the bill that's in there oh
 
05:29:27.830 --> 05:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
yeah hb 254. okay hb 250 that's the one
 
05:29:30.948 --> 05:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
that we voted out on the conditions yeah
 
05:29:34.548 --> 05:29:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:37.430 --> 05:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment has six
 
05:29:39.750 --> 05:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
yep six beds yep
 
05:29:39.760 --> 05:29:40.708 align:start position:0%
yep six beds yep
and

05:29:40.708 --> 05:29:40.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:29:40.718 --> 05:29:42.548 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:29:42.548 --> 05:29:42.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:43.590 --> 05:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
is it
 
05:29:45.510 --> 05:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
are the six beds
 
05:29:47.830 --> 05:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
privately ran nope they'll be run by the
 
05:29:52.948 --> 05:29:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:54.628 --> 05:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
will be run by the state
 
05:29:59.030 --> 05:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and is there a um is there a limbo
 
05:30:01.670 --> 05:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
period still with respect to sending
 
05:30:03.590 --> 05:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
kids out of state if
 
05:30:05.830 --> 05:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
the facility's not built before they
 
05:30:07.910 --> 05:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
shut down the cemetery no i don't
 
05:30:09.830 --> 05:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
believe so
 
05:30:12.070 --> 05:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
i mean i can let you look at this one if
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
you want just just keep in mind that it
 
05:30:18.230 --> 05:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's um 12 beds i mean it's six beds not
 
05:30:20.310 --> 05:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
12. right yep
 
05:30:22.548 --> 05:30:22.558 align:start position:0%
did you guys want to look at these
 
05:30:24.150 --> 05:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
or wait for the other one so we don't
 
05:30:25.590 --> 05:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
get confused
 
05:30:28.230 --> 05:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i got a mess
 
05:30:30.310 --> 05:30:30.320 align:start position:0%

up there karen's going to bring it down
 
05:30:33.830 --> 05:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
as soon as it's ready
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
nope not that one these are nothing
 
05:30:37.910 --> 05:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
there they are
 
05:30:39.430 --> 05:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
05:30:39.440 --> 05:30:41.590 align:start position:0%
yes please
okay

05:30:41.590 --> 05:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:30:43.270 --> 05:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
yeah no those are
 
05:30:43.280 --> 05:31:03.430 align:start position:0%
yeah no those are
trash

05:31:03.430 --> 05:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:06.070 --> 05:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
i believe i voted against 254 in this
 
05:31:06.080 --> 05:31:07.190 align:start position:0%
i believe i voted against 254 in this
committee

05:31:07.190 --> 05:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:31:10.548 --> 05:31:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:12.788 --> 05:31:12.798 align:start position:0%
because it says 14 to 1 out of the
 
05:31:16.548 --> 05:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
committee and i think i vaguely remember
 
05:31:19.590 --> 05:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:21.270 --> 05:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
05:31:22.788 --> 05:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
interesting so you'll probably vote
 
05:31:32.788 --> 05:31:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:34.708 --> 05:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
05:31:34.718 --> 05:31:38.868 align:start position:0%
madam chair
yes

05:31:38.868 --> 05:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:40.788 --> 05:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
that wasn't good i i know that wasn't
 
05:31:41.460 --> 05:31:41.470 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
05:31:41.470 --> 05:31:43.830 align:start position:0%
the chair
[Laughter]

05:31:43.830 --> 05:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:31:43.840 --> 05:31:45.030 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
yes

05:31:45.030 --> 05:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:31:47.990 --> 05:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative alessia um
 
05:31:49.350 --> 05:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
i haven't read through the whole thing
 
05:31:50.548 --> 05:31:50.558 align:start position:0%
as yet
 
05:31:53.030 --> 05:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
i probably should wait in this question
 
05:31:55.430 --> 05:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
so everything's the same except for is
 
05:31:58.310 --> 05:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
six beds instead of 12 bed
 
05:32:01.110 --> 05:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
that was in the other amendment yeah
 
05:32:03.510 --> 05:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
in the previous amendment okay
 
05:32:05.830 --> 05:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
so we've combined
 
05:32:08.868 --> 05:32:08.878 align:start position:0%
like all three thought processes right
 
05:32:12.390 --> 05:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
we've combined the the 458 as it
 
05:32:14.548 --> 05:32:14.558 align:start position:0%
originally was
 
05:32:14.558 --> 05:32:15.510 align:start position:0%
originally was
with

05:32:15.510 --> 05:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:32:18.628 --> 05:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
sb 254 which we passed out of here that
 
05:32:21.830 --> 05:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
reduces the offenses for placement okay
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
at sununu and we've added the six bed
 
05:32:24.958 --> 05:32:27.350 align:start position:0%
at sununu and we've added the six bed
facility

05:32:27.350 --> 05:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
facility
 
05:32:28.708 --> 05:32:28.718 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
we'll let finance take it from there
 
05:32:33.510 --> 05:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
okay my question is
 
05:32:35.350 --> 05:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
so suppose they're
 
05:32:35.360 --> 05:32:36.390 align:start position:0%
so suppose they're
eight

05:32:36.390 --> 05:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
eight
 
05:32:38.150 --> 05:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
individuals so
 
05:32:40.548 --> 05:32:40.558 align:start position:0%
they can what i would like to see in the
 
05:32:40.558 --> 05:32:41.910 align:start position:0%
they can what i would like to see in the
design

05:32:41.910 --> 05:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
design
 
05:32:44.708 --> 05:32:44.718 align:start position:0%
is perhaps um and i had talked to
 
05:32:47.270 --> 05:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
director ribsum about this before is
 
05:32:50.548 --> 05:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
temporary walls space a little extra
 
05:32:53.110 --> 05:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
space so that they could manipulate the
 
05:32:55.430 --> 05:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
so-called pods
 
05:32:55.440 --> 05:32:56.470 align:start position:0%
so-called pods
right

05:32:56.470 --> 05:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:33:00.070 --> 05:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
when in case so say you had you know two
 
05:33:03.750 --> 05:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
two and two if you needed four and two
 
05:33:04.948 --> 05:33:04.958 align:start position:0%
you could
 
05:33:07.670 --> 05:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
you can mix it up
 
05:33:07.680 --> 05:33:09.750 align:start position:0%
you can mix it up
okay

05:33:09.750 --> 05:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:33:09.760 --> 05:33:10.470 align:start position:0%
okay
and

05:33:10.470 --> 05:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:13.030 --> 05:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to be done still the time
 
05:33:15.510 --> 05:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
period still the same time frame
 
05:33:17.750 --> 05:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
um i'm fine i would like to say i would
 
05:33:19.430 --> 05:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
like to see it sooner but that's
 
05:33:21.510 --> 05:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
something that we can
 
05:33:23.350 --> 05:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
probably leave to finance because by the
 
05:33:25.110 --> 05:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
time they get it they'll have a better
 
05:33:27.190 --> 05:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
aspect of the price of everything and
 
05:33:29.430 --> 05:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
what they're going to be
 
05:33:33.430 --> 05:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:35.670 --> 05:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
i feel dirty but then you do why do you
 
05:33:37.750 --> 05:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
feel dirty because i don't think it's
 
05:33:41.590 --> 05:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
one finance that part i think that we
 
05:33:44.548 --> 05:33:44.558 align:start position:0%
 well i'm my only concern is if we
 
05:33:47.830 --> 05:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
change that date to make it sooner
 
05:33:49.750 --> 05:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
then we leave ourselves in a position
 
05:33:52.390 --> 05:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
where children may have to be
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
placed out of state and we don't want
 
05:33:58.948 --> 05:33:58.958 align:start position:0%
that to happen you know um
 
05:34:02.070 --> 05:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's my feeling on it while i
 
05:34:04.470 --> 05:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
don't want it to go that far
 
05:34:06.310 --> 05:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
i don't want to see kids sent out of
 
05:34:08.510 --> 05:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
state either because we have to close
 
05:34:22.948 --> 05:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:25.190 --> 05:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
anyone have available other yes she just
 
05:34:28.708 --> 05:34:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:31.830 --> 05:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes i'm sorry i was just
 
05:34:33.590 --> 05:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
hoping that
 
05:34:35.910 --> 05:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
the six is half of the twelve so it will
 
05:34:38.230 --> 05:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
cut the time down and we could at least
 
05:34:39.830 --> 05:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
do that
 
05:34:42.390 --> 05:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
if we had the six we could it could cut
 
05:34:44.628 --> 05:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
the time down but
 
05:34:47.670 --> 05:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
i just i don't see that happening it's
 
05:34:47.680 --> 05:34:49.270 align:start position:0%
i just i don't see that happening it's
government

05:34:49.270 --> 05:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:34:50.390 --> 05:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:34:52.868 --> 05:34:52.878 align:start position:0%
everything just takes forever
 
05:34:54.788 --> 05:34:54.798 align:start position:0%
i feel like
 
05:34:57.510 --> 05:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
do you know what i mean
 
05:34:59.910 --> 05:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
and then if we do move the time frame do
 
05:35:01.350 --> 05:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
you have another copy
 
05:35:04.150 --> 05:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
oh my god
 
05:35:07.350 --> 05:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
i think there's more
 
05:35:11.430 --> 05:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry go ahead i apologize
 
05:35:13.910 --> 05:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
oh i was just throwing things out
 
05:35:13.920 --> 05:35:15.190 align:start position:0%
oh i was just throwing things out
because

05:35:15.190 --> 05:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:35:17.910 --> 05:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
first was 18 then they said 12 and then
 
05:35:19.910 --> 05:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
if we went with the six then i was
 
05:35:21.190 --> 05:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
hoping that
 
05:35:22.948 --> 05:35:22.958 align:start position:0%
that would i know
 
05:35:25.510 --> 05:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
i would too but i also worry i mean
 
05:35:25.520 --> 05:35:26.628 align:start position:0%
i would too but i also worry i mean
there

05:35:26.628 --> 05:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:35:31.190 --> 05:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
i i know of stick kids right now that
 
05:35:32.868 --> 05:35:32.878 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be more
 
05:35:35.590 --> 05:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
but you know i mean so here is my huge
 
05:35:36.788 --> 05:35:36.798 align:start position:0%
issue right
 
05:35:39.350 --> 05:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
do we put juveniles who adults who
 
05:35:43.270 --> 05:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
create misdemeanors are they put in jail
 
05:35:45.590 --> 05:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
for some of these offenses these kids
 
05:35:47.110 --> 05:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
are being put in jail and we don't even
 
05:35:51.670 --> 05:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:55.830 --> 05:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:58.390 --> 05:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
i try not to get emotional over this but
 
05:36:00.548 --> 05:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
i can't help but think about all those
 
05:36:03.990 --> 05:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
cases of how many people whose lives
 
05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
were ruined ruined
 
05:36:07.600 --> 05:36:09.350 align:start position:0%
were ruined ruined
because

05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:36:11.030 --> 05:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
they were placed at sununu and what
 
05:36:12.628 --> 05:36:12.638 align:start position:0%
happened to them because there are
 
05:36:12.638 --> 05:36:14.070 align:start position:0%
happened to them because there are
lifelong

05:36:14.070 --> 05:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
lifelong
 
05:36:16.470 --> 05:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
issues drug addiction how many of them
 
05:36:19.670 --> 05:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
died from suicide or drug overdoses
 
05:36:21.270 --> 05:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
because they were trying to cope with
 
05:36:23.270 --> 05:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
what happened to them i don't want that
 
05:36:23.280 --> 05:36:24.150 align:start position:0%
what happened to them i don't want that
ever

05:36:24.150 --> 05:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
ever
 
05:36:25.990 --> 05:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
to happen again
 
05:36:29.270 --> 05:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
i just can't even stand it
 
05:36:32.310 --> 05:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
and i i'm sorry i'm getting emotional
 
05:36:35.350 --> 05:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
but it's just something that just tears
 
05:36:37.910 --> 05:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:39.750 --> 05:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
we were supposed to be looking out for
 
05:36:43.670 --> 05:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
them and we failed tremendously
 
05:36:46.470 --> 05:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
so i apologize
 
05:36:48.070 --> 05:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm a little bit of a mess these
 
05:36:49.830 --> 05:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
days anyway so
 
05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:36:53.270 --> 05:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
no i appreciate if i may
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%

05:36:55.920 --> 05:36:57.110 align:start position:0%
yes please appreciate your honesty
but

05:36:57.110 --> 05:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:36:59.270 --> 05:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm very immersed emotional about it
 
05:37:00.310 --> 05:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:37:03.110 --> 05:37:03.120 align:start position:0%

05:37:08.070 --> 05:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:09.510 --> 05:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
i i'm just
 
05:37:12.150 --> 05:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
i'm nervous i don't want to set them up
 
05:37:15.430 --> 05:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
to fail right because because of the
 
05:37:15.440 --> 05:37:17.030 align:start position:0%
to fail right because because of the
past

05:37:17.030 --> 05:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
past
 
05:37:19.350 --> 05:37:19.360 align:start position:0%

watching
 
05:37:23.030 --> 05:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
the hen house as they should have been
 
05:37:25.510 --> 05:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
right i don't want them to suffer
 
05:37:28.070 --> 05:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean i don't i do a
 
05:37:28.080 --> 05:37:29.110 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean i don't i do a
rush

05:37:29.110 --> 05:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
rush
 
05:37:29.120 --> 05:37:30.310 align:start position:0%
rush
decision

05:37:30.310 --> 05:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:37:31.590 --> 05:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
because of
 
05:37:33.510 --> 05:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
what we know happened
 
05:37:36.628 --> 05:37:36.638 align:start position:0%
right right unfortunately so
 
05:37:39.030 --> 05:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
i've been working on this all week
 
05:37:41.670 --> 05:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
um it's just it stinks that it has to be
 
05:37:43.430 --> 05:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
out of the committee today you know what
 
05:37:46.390 --> 05:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
i mean that's the part that stinks
 
05:37:46.400 --> 05:37:47.190 align:start position:0%
i mean that's the part that stinks
so

05:37:47.190 --> 05:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:37:51.030 --> 05:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:53.670 --> 05:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
i feel good with the six beds and giving
 
05:37:56.070 --> 05:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
finance time to look everything over and
 
05:37:57.830 --> 05:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
if they want to raise it a little they
 
05:37:57.840 --> 05:37:59.030 align:start position:0%
if they want to raise it a little they
can

05:37:59.030 --> 05:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:38:01.430 --> 05:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
but i want us to send a strong message
 
05:38:05.750 --> 05:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:05.760 --> 05:38:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
huh

05:38:09.270 --> 05:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:11.190 --> 05:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
yeah right
 
05:38:13.910 --> 05:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
so i just you know that's that's where i
 
05:38:15.130 --> 05:38:15.140 align:start position:0%
am with it um
 
05:38:15.140 --> 05:38:16.310 align:start position:0%
am with it um
[Music]

05:38:16.310 --> 05:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:38:16.320 --> 05:38:17.190 align:start position:0%
[Music]
just

05:38:17.190 --> 05:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:38:18.070 --> 05:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
05:38:20.150 --> 05:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative elsia do you do you have
 
05:38:21.590 --> 05:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
05:38:23.590 --> 05:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
or is there something you would like me
 
05:38:26.310 --> 05:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
to change i mean i can send in for
 
05:38:32.150 --> 05:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:34.708 --> 05:38:34.718 align:start position:0%
of course
 
05:38:38.390 --> 05:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
i hope i have it i hope i have an answer
 
05:38:40.230 --> 05:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm not trying to stall but my
 
05:38:42.470 --> 05:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
question is what would happen if it went
 
05:38:42.480 --> 05:38:43.510 align:start position:0%
question is what would happen if it went
to

05:38:43.510 --> 05:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:38:45.430 --> 05:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
interim study could the kids still stay
 
05:38:47.750 --> 05:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
there until oh no
 
05:38:49.830 --> 05:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
that facility has to close that's the
 
05:38:52.150 --> 05:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
clothes yeah
 
05:38:52.160 --> 05:38:52.948 align:start position:0%
clothes yeah
so

05:38:52.948 --> 05:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:38:54.788 --> 05:38:54.798 align:start position:0%
um that's why
 
05:38:56.868 --> 05:38:56.878 align:start position:0%
that's why we have to work really
 
05:38:58.470 --> 05:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
closely with
 
05:39:01.510 --> 05:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative wallner
 
05:39:04.230 --> 05:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
so that we you know i mean like she said
 
05:39:05.830 --> 05:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
she's been
 
05:39:08.310 --> 05:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
doing this for years you know
 
05:39:10.390 --> 05:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
she's got the whole finance committee to
 
05:39:13.990 --> 05:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
to work with too right so i mean
 
05:39:17.190 --> 05:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:18.948 --> 05:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
i know what you're saying i do know what
 
05:39:20.310 --> 05:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
05:39:21.750 --> 05:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
i totally get it
 
05:39:24.150 --> 05:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
i really do thank you
 
05:39:26.868 --> 05:39:26.878 align:start position:0%
so yes go ahead the um
 
05:39:29.190 --> 05:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment doesn't reference research
 
05:39:30.830 --> 05:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
base either
 
05:39:34.548 --> 05:39:34.558 align:start position:0%
right oh well i see it no idea
 
05:39:35.830 --> 05:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
is that good oh that's fine that's
 
05:39:37.750 --> 05:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
something we may want to okay we may
 
05:39:39.190 --> 05:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
want that's something we can change
 
05:39:40.948 --> 05:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
later on though right because we've got
 
05:39:42.548 --> 05:39:42.558 align:start position:0%
time for that
 
05:39:42.558 --> 05:39:44.310 align:start position:0%
time for that
great

05:39:44.310 --> 05:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
great
 
05:39:44.320 --> 05:39:45.510 align:start position:0%
great
right

05:39:45.510 --> 05:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:39:45.520 --> 05:39:51.350 align:start position:0%
right
yeah

05:39:51.350 --> 05:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:53.590 --> 05:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative ocala
 
05:39:55.590 --> 05:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um it's
 
05:39:57.190 --> 05:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
so it's already in law that it's going
 
05:39:59.510 --> 05:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
to be closed um
 
05:40:03.110 --> 05:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
that was in hb2 and so that's already
 
05:40:05.990 --> 05:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
the the paradigm that we're living in
 
05:40:08.548 --> 05:40:08.558 align:start position:0%
and so if we didn't if we interim
 
05:40:10.230 --> 05:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
studied this then it would just close
 
05:40:12.390 --> 05:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
without a plan kind of a thing right we
 
05:40:15.670 --> 05:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
need a plan and so that that is that is
 
05:40:19.910 --> 05:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
obviously a concern um and and as far as
 
05:40:19.920 --> 05:40:21.750 align:start position:0%
obviously a concern um and and as far as
the

05:40:21.750 --> 05:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:40:24.390 --> 05:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:40:24.400 --> 05:40:26.548 align:start position:0%
the um
the

05:40:26.548 --> 05:40:26.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:40:28.628 --> 05:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:40:33.030 --> 05:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
research-based stuff i looked at 170 and
 
05:40:35.990 --> 05:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
it seemed like there was a lot of
 
05:40:37.990 --> 05:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
options as far as
 
05:40:38.000 --> 05:40:39.350 align:start position:0%
options as far as
um

05:40:39.350 --> 05:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:41.030 --> 05:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
stuff that
 
05:40:41.040 --> 05:40:42.708 align:start position:0%
stuff that
is

05:40:42.708 --> 05:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:40:44.070 --> 05:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
not just
 
05:40:46.868 --> 05:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
it it talked about things that were not
 
05:40:49.430 --> 05:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
just um
 
05:40:49.440 --> 05:40:50.230 align:start position:0%
just um
uh

05:40:50.230 --> 05:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:40:53.430 --> 05:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
evidence-based it talked about uh more
 
05:40:54.708 --> 05:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
things than that so i'm not sure that
 
05:40:56.548 --> 05:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
that should be a sticking point
 
05:40:59.430 --> 05:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
but um
 
05:41:02.070 --> 05:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
but obviously i'm not sure that i'm
 
05:41:04.548 --> 05:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
going to uh i
 
05:41:04.558 --> 05:41:05.510 align:start position:0%
going to uh i
i

05:41:05.510 --> 05:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:41:08.230 --> 05:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
didn't support 254 and
 
05:41:11.830 --> 05:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to support support 254
 
05:41:11.840 --> 05:41:12.628 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to support support 254
now

05:41:12.628 --> 05:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:41:17.110 --> 05:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
why am i not surprised
 
05:41:18.708 --> 05:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:41:20.230 --> 05:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
all that i have to say on that thanks
 
05:41:20.240 --> 05:41:23.030 align:start position:0%
all that i have to say on that thanks
okay

05:41:23.030 --> 05:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:25.110 --> 05:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative litchfield
 
05:41:26.230 --> 05:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:41:28.070 --> 05:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
can you please just walk me through the
 
05:41:30.548 --> 05:41:30.558 align:start position:0%
beds one more time so we listened to
 
05:41:32.390 --> 05:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
testimony several times this morning
 
05:41:36.390 --> 05:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
where we currently have 12 children so i
 
05:41:38.390 --> 05:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying but
 
05:41:40.390 --> 05:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
what happens if we need
 
05:41:42.548 --> 05:41:42.558 align:start position:0%
12 beds what happened to those other six
 
05:41:44.310 --> 05:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
children potentially go out of state i
 
05:41:46.150 --> 05:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
mean they're not necessarily going to be
 
05:41:48.070 --> 05:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
let go so
 
05:41:48.080 --> 05:41:49.030 align:start position:0%
let go so
with

05:41:49.030 --> 05:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:41:51.190 --> 05:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
um sb 254
 
05:41:52.948 --> 05:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
i do believe that will help bring the
 
05:41:55.350 --> 05:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
census down but it will also send the
 
05:41:56.948 --> 05:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
lesser offenders
 
05:41:56.958 --> 05:41:57.830 align:start position:0%
lesser offenders
to

05:41:57.830 --> 05:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:42:01.510 --> 05:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
the community-based treatment
 
05:42:03.590 --> 05:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
places rather than
 
05:42:06.230 --> 05:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
the jail
 
05:42:09.430 --> 05:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question
 
05:42:11.270 --> 05:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
05:42:14.310 --> 05:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
so are you proposing the six beds for
 
05:42:16.390 --> 05:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
what we talked about earlier like just
 
05:42:17.670 --> 05:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
for felons
 
05:42:21.110 --> 05:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
just for the major felonies that
 
05:42:21.120 --> 05:42:23.030 align:start position:0%
just for the major felonies that
kids

05:42:23.030 --> 05:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
kids
 
05:42:25.350 --> 05:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
would it be like the kids who
 
05:42:27.990 --> 05:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
are charged as adults yeah that for a
 
05:42:30.150 --> 05:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
place for them to be with without being
 
05:42:32.150 --> 05:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
in adult jail
 
05:42:33.670 --> 05:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
adult prison
 
05:42:33.680 --> 05:42:38.070 align:start position:0%
adult prison
okay

05:42:38.070 --> 05:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:41.350 --> 05:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
yes a representative yokela i'm sorry i
 
05:42:43.590 --> 05:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
apologize um so
 
05:42:43.600 --> 05:42:46.830 align:start position:0%
apologize um so
um

05:42:46.830 --> 05:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:50.070 --> 05:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
there there's um
 
05:42:52.070 --> 05:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
i guess a discussion to be had about
 
05:42:54.628 --> 05:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
whether or not um
 
05:42:56.628 --> 05:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
detained people because right now a
 
05:42:58.310 --> 05:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
significant number of people at the
 
05:43:00.070 --> 05:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
sununu center are not actually committed
 
05:43:02.230 --> 05:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
there they're just detained and so do
 
05:43:04.310 --> 05:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
they have to be
 
05:43:06.390 --> 05:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
um detained
 
05:43:08.788 --> 05:43:08.798 align:start position:0%
in this six beds facility i don't think
 
05:43:10.788 --> 05:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
that's necessarily the case they could
 
05:43:13.990 --> 05:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
be detained elsewhere and so we so
 
05:43:14.000 --> 05:43:14.868 align:start position:0%
be detained elsewhere and so we so
um

05:43:14.868 --> 05:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:18.150 --> 05:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
the 12 people may are is including the
 
05:43:21.590 --> 05:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
number of detained people and not and so
 
05:43:25.110 --> 05:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
that may be a factor to bring in and um
 
05:43:27.990 --> 05:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
just in reference to
 
05:43:30.390 --> 05:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative smith's comment um it's
 
05:43:33.030 --> 05:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
not just felonies it's
 
05:43:35.510 --> 05:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
violent felonies that are because we're
 
05:43:36.788 --> 05:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
still letting
 
05:43:40.150 --> 05:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
regular felonies that are not classified
 
05:43:42.470 --> 05:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
like in this legislation
 
05:43:46.230 --> 05:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
um as violent essentially um
 
05:43:49.190 --> 05:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
to not be uh committed
 
05:43:49.200 --> 05:43:49.910 align:start position:0%
to not be uh committed
so

05:43:49.910 --> 05:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:43:52.310 --> 05:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
those those felonies under adult
 
05:43:54.070 --> 05:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
situations may
 
05:43:57.030 --> 05:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
may actually lead to jail time
 
05:43:58.628 --> 05:43:58.638 align:start position:0%
if they were an adult
 
05:44:01.270 --> 05:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
but the felonies
 
05:44:05.670 --> 05:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
under um 254 hb 254 would still let them
 
05:44:07.590 --> 05:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
not be committed
 
05:44:09.190 --> 05:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:44:10.628 --> 05:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
05:44:13.830 --> 05:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
i just i really would just like to see
 
05:44:17.110 --> 05:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
us setting these kids up for success
 
05:44:19.590 --> 05:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's really
 
05:44:21.910 --> 05:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
i think the most important thing is we
 
05:44:24.230 --> 05:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
want them to succeed
 
05:44:26.310 --> 05:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
and we want to give them the tools that
 
05:44:28.390 --> 05:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
they need to succeed
 
05:44:30.150 --> 05:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
05:44:33.670 --> 05:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to do that without
 
05:44:33.680 --> 05:44:36.310 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to do that without
jail

05:44:36.310 --> 05:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:38.310 --> 05:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative de simone
 
05:44:40.548 --> 05:44:40.558 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:44:42.390 --> 05:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
i think that one of the parts of this
 
05:44:44.230 --> 05:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
discussion that we're missing is the
 
05:44:47.030 --> 05:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
fact that last year
 
05:44:47.040 --> 05:44:48.150 align:start position:0%
fact that last year
um

05:44:48.150 --> 05:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:49.830 --> 05:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
05:44:52.150 --> 05:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
set aside some monies for juvenile
 
05:44:54.948 --> 05:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
diversion programs
 
05:44:57.510 --> 05:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
and that's where a lot of kids are going
 
05:44:59.910 --> 05:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
to be dealt with
 
05:45:02.470 --> 05:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
who are not violent
 
05:45:06.788 --> 05:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
committing violent felony crimes
 
05:45:09.510 --> 05:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
so with the governor's money going to
 
05:45:13.510 --> 05:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
um we're helping
 
05:45:17.830 --> 05:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
my my
 
05:45:17.840 --> 05:45:19.110 align:start position:0%
my my
um

05:45:19.110 --> 05:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:21.430 --> 05:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
full disclosure here my program
 
05:45:23.910 --> 05:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
sees hundreds of kids a year that would
 
05:45:26.868 --> 05:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
normally go to the sununu center
 
05:45:30.070 --> 05:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
but they go through diversion programs
 
05:45:30.080 --> 05:45:31.670 align:start position:0%
but they go through diversion programs
and

05:45:31.670 --> 05:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:45:33.910 --> 05:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
they're successful and it's set that
 
05:45:37.990 --> 05:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
program sets them up for success
 
05:45:40.310 --> 05:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
um i've had many kids come back to me
 
05:45:41.830 --> 05:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
and say guess what
 
05:45:45.270 --> 05:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
i just graduated college or did this and
 
05:45:48.390 --> 05:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
i just got a management position in this
 
05:45:50.548 --> 05:45:50.558 align:start position:0%
facility that i'm working in and whatnot
 
05:45:51.670 --> 05:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
05:45:53.510 --> 05:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
these are kids that are going through
 
05:45:55.670 --> 05:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
diversion so that money is being well
 
05:45:55.680 --> 05:45:57.510 align:start position:0%
diversion so that money is being well
spent

05:45:57.510 --> 05:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
spent
 
05:45:59.430 --> 05:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
having said that since that money is
 
05:46:02.150 --> 05:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
going there
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
and the sununu center has to close done
 
05:46:05.520 --> 05:46:07.590 align:start position:0%
and the sununu center has to close done
deal

05:46:07.590 --> 05:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
deal
 
05:46:10.390 --> 05:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
i think that we need to realize that the
 
05:46:12.230 --> 05:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
amount of kids that would be going to
 
05:46:13.830 --> 05:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
sununu center
 
05:46:16.230 --> 05:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
is decreasing due to the diversion
 
05:46:16.240 --> 05:46:18.150 align:start position:0%
is decreasing due to the diversion
programs

05:46:18.150 --> 05:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
programs
 
05:46:21.910 --> 05:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
so there is the room for the felons
 
05:46:27.750 --> 05:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:27.760 --> 05:46:28.788 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:46:28.788 --> 05:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:46:31.590 --> 05:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i i get the community based
 
05:46:34.310 --> 05:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
services yeah however what is acceptable
 
05:46:36.150 --> 05:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
for a waiting time for a child that
 
05:46:38.470 --> 05:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
needs those services and that's in your
 
05:46:40.868 --> 05:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
bigger municipalities like manchester
 
05:46:40.878 --> 05:46:42.150 align:start position:0%
bigger municipalities like manchester
nashua

05:46:42.150 --> 05:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
05:46:46.390 --> 05:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
um there's waiting there's wait time you
 
05:46:48.548 --> 05:46:48.558 align:start position:0%
know this child needs this this this
 
05:46:51.110 --> 05:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
service great uh
 
05:46:53.270 --> 05:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
we'll have an opening in a month
 
05:46:55.110 --> 05:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
i you know is that
 
05:46:55.120 --> 05:46:56.708 align:start position:0%
i you know is that
i

05:46:56.708 --> 05:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:46:58.868 --> 05:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
i mean i i prefer that when a child
 
05:47:00.948 --> 05:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
needs services
 
05:47:02.230 --> 05:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
the next day
 
05:47:05.190 --> 05:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
um so when we look at community base you
 
05:47:07.030 --> 05:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
know we have put money into community
 
05:47:08.948 --> 05:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
base however
 
05:47:11.110 --> 05:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
your larger municipalities it's usually
 
05:47:12.390 --> 05:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
split up
 
05:47:15.350 --> 05:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
through municipality and your larger
 
05:47:18.948 --> 05:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
communities which have the heavier um
 
05:47:21.430 --> 05:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh the heavier
 
05:47:21.440 --> 05:47:23.510 align:start position:0%
uh the heavier
caseload

05:47:23.510 --> 05:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
caseload
 
05:47:27.190 --> 05:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:28.708 --> 05:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh capacity
 
05:47:30.150 --> 05:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know we don't we don't have the
 
05:47:32.310 --> 05:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
capacity so so
 
05:47:34.230 --> 05:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
i you know
 
05:47:36.788 --> 05:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
i mean i get that i get this amendment
 
05:47:38.948 --> 05:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
and i'm gonna support it
 
05:47:38.958 --> 05:47:40.390 align:start position:0%
and i'm gonna support it
um

05:47:40.390 --> 05:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:42.628 --> 05:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
but when we talk about community-based
 
05:47:45.590 --> 05:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
treatment let's be sure that
 
05:47:47.430 --> 05:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
every community
 
05:47:50.150 --> 05:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
has community-based treatment that a
 
05:47:52.310 --> 05:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
child doesn't have to wait a month to
 
05:47:54.830 --> 05:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
get into you know
 
05:47:54.840 --> 05:47:56.548 align:start position:0%
get into you know
right

05:47:56.548 --> 05:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:47:57.910 --> 05:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's a good point
 
05:48:01.830 --> 05:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:03.590 --> 05:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
so is there
 
05:48:03.600 --> 05:48:05.510 align:start position:0%
so is there
um

05:48:05.510 --> 05:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:07.990 --> 05:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
05:48:08.000 --> 05:48:10.150 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
aldshiller

05:48:10.150 --> 05:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
aldshiller
 
05:48:11.910 --> 05:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair could you clarify
 
05:48:13.830 --> 05:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
for me because um
 
05:48:15.270 --> 05:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
i i
 
05:48:16.310 --> 05:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
in in
 
05:48:17.750 --> 05:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
either version of the bill they're both
 
05:48:19.750 --> 05:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
the same in this particular point
 
05:48:21.670 --> 05:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
um but i'll refer to the amendment that
 
05:48:25.030 --> 05:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
you just passed out page three line
 
05:48:28.150 --> 05:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
thirty page three
 
05:48:30.390 --> 05:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
is the sum of one dollar there so that
 
05:48:32.310 --> 05:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
the finance committee can decide how
 
05:48:34.470 --> 05:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
much gopher and how much
 
05:48:36.948 --> 05:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
general care okay thank you that's i and
 
05:48:38.628 --> 05:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
and i know that they had said they
 
05:48:41.670 --> 05:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
wanted us to put in the the 15 million
 
05:48:43.910 --> 05:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
but i think that we leave that dollar
 
05:48:43.920 --> 05:48:44.948 align:start position:0%
but i think that we leave that dollar
amount

05:48:44.948 --> 05:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
amount
 
05:48:47.110 --> 05:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
for um finance to figure out what
 
05:48:48.470 --> 05:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
they're gonna need
 
05:48:48.480 --> 05:48:49.350 align:start position:0%
they're gonna need
um

05:48:49.350 --> 05:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:51.030 --> 05:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know we're just really not the money
 
05:48:53.510 --> 05:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
people so i think but by placing that
 
05:48:55.110 --> 05:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
dollar in there it gives them a line to
 
05:49:00.070 --> 05:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:03.430 --> 05:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
05:49:08.948 --> 05:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:13.030 --> 05:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:16.070 --> 05:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
honestly i don't know where to begin
 
05:49:18.310 --> 05:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
i started my journey in the legislature
 
05:49:20.548 --> 05:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
this year
 
05:49:22.230 --> 05:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
prior to that
 
05:49:23.670 --> 05:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
i was a victim
 
05:49:27.110 --> 05:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:27.120 --> 05:49:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
this

05:49:35.750 --> 05:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:35.760 --> 05:49:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
despite

05:49:39.670 --> 05:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:43.830 --> 05:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:44.788 --> 05:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:49:48.150 --> 05:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
the best solution moving forward
 
05:49:50.310 --> 05:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
and i encourage you all
 
05:49:52.868 --> 05:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
to support this amendment
 
05:49:55.430 --> 05:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
it is not the best
 
05:49:55.440 --> 05:50:01.430 align:start position:0%
it is not the best
situation

05:50:01.430 --> 05:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:03.430 --> 05:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
but i support it
 
05:50:05.030 --> 05:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
i don't agree with privatizing the
 
05:50:05.040 --> 05:50:06.470 align:start position:0%
i don't agree with privatizing the
facility

05:50:06.470 --> 05:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
facility
 
05:50:12.390 --> 05:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:14.788 --> 05:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
i don't believe in locking kids up
 
05:50:16.390 --> 05:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
one of those kids
 
05:50:18.628 --> 05:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
probably one of the most successful kids
 
05:50:22.708 --> 05:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:24.948 --> 05:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
we can be better
 
05:50:26.628 --> 05:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
and by we i mean
 
05:50:30.868 --> 05:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:33.910 --> 05:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
we're not bad kids we all hear that
 
05:50:39.030 --> 05:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:39.040 --> 05:50:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:50:39.830 --> 05:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:50:41.670 --> 05:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's uh all i wanted to say with that
 
05:50:43.110 --> 05:50:43.120 align:start position:0%

05:52:56.230 --> 05:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
i'm uncomfortable that we're
 
05:52:58.390 --> 05:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
that we haven't had any time to process
 
05:52:59.990 --> 05:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
this and to
 
05:53:00.000 --> 05:53:01.510 align:start position:0%
this and to
just

05:53:01.510 --> 05:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:53:02.948 --> 05:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
to think about this
 
05:53:06.310 --> 05:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
in less than an hour um
 
05:53:06.320 --> 05:53:07.670 align:start position:0%
in less than an hour um
so

05:53:07.670 --> 05:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:53:12.070 --> 05:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
i preface my votes and my questions on
 
05:53:14.150 --> 05:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
being feeling very very rushed and
 
05:53:18.868 --> 05:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
feeling i feel i feel just as rushed um
 
05:53:21.190 --> 05:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
i think the timeline stinks that the
 
05:53:23.350 --> 05:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
time frame that we have to get this done
 
05:53:25.990 --> 05:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
because it goes to a second committee
 
05:53:28.470 --> 05:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
and we didn't get this until last week
 
05:53:30.390 --> 05:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
and they were sending it straight to
 
05:53:33.510 --> 05:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
finance and i said oh no
 
05:53:35.510 --> 05:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's coming to children and family law
 
05:53:35.520 --> 05:53:38.708 align:start position:0%
that's coming to children and family law
first
