232fn
 
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
when this committee last met we were
 
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
discussing a number of items regarding
 
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
costs and such I will tell you that I've
 
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
had conversations with a number of
 
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
people since then but before I discussed
 
00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
that is there anything in particular
 
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
from the last meeting or anything from
 
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
the emails that you have received
 
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
that you would like to comment on or ask
 
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
I'm just I I would like to hear from the
 
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association
 
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.490 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association
um

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 align:start position:0%
just on I believe they sent out an email
 
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
we got some information and just expound
 
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
on that information looking at if they
 
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
see cost and I guess I'm looking to see
 
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
what there was something said about a
 
00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 align:start position:0%
gap analysis if they could explain that
 
00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 align:start position:0%
that would be very helpful to me
 
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
I'm aware please approach I'm aware of
 
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
two emails that we received
 
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
one from the admissible Association
 
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
regarding the city of Concord and
 
00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
referencing uh OSHA 1400 and then one
 
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
from Roche
 
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
which you had reiterated some
 
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
information you received from one of
 
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
your constituent towns so those are the
 
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
only two emails that I know that I have
 
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
received that I passed on to everyone
 
00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 align:start position:0%
so regarding the one from Concord is
 
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
that pretty much what you're talking
 
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 align:start position:0%
about the one that came through
 
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.410 align:start position:0%
about the one that came through
yesterday

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.570 align:start position:0%
yesterday
okay

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
okay good morning I'm Margaret burns
 
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
Association and
 
00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
um two two Communications I've I've had
 
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
I think with members of the committee
 
00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
the first was after I after the last
 
00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 align:start position:0%
work session I spoke with our board of
 
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
directors about House Bill 232 and
 
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
issues of cost as well as what they
 
00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
would need to see to better understand
 
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
this issue and to potentially not be
 
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill as we currently are
 
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that they
 
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
discussed was needing to see a more
 
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Gap analysis meaning a
 
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive assessment of the
 
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
difference between the currently
 
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
applicable Rules promulgated by the
 
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and the rules that
 
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
are being proposed to be put in place
 
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
the 1910 rules and that so that was one
 
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
of the questions they had was how do we
 
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
know what we're going to in order to
 
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
assess what the impact will be and what
 
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
kind of additional compliance training
 
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
other costs we will incur if if the new
 
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
rules are implemented so that that's
 
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 align:start position:0%
where the Gap analysis discussion came
 
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.009 align:start position:0%
where the Gap analysis discussion came
from

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I know that subsequently there was
 
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
also some written testimony from the
 
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
safety coordinator in the city of
 
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
Concord which I had forwarded on related
 
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
to concerns that they have about the
 
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
difference between current rules that
 
00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 align:start position:0%
apply to them as well as what and what
 
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
would apply under the 1910 rules our
 
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
board of directors also expressed that
 
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 align:start position:0%
they would think it would be prudent for
 
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
there to be a study Commission on the
 
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
issue so that stakeholders who would be
 
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
affected by new rules would have a
 
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
chance to be part of that investigation
 
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
and research and then be part of a
 
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
discussion and recommendation of
 
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
potential future legislation and so that
 
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
was one of the other recommendations
 
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
that was made when we had that
 
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.030 align:start position:0%
that was made when we had that
discussion

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
I am aware that assistant commissioner
 
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
Ogden in his free time
 
00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
on weekends
 
00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 align:start position:0%
or had his staff go through the entire
 
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
1910 and compared it to what they're
 
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
doing now
 
00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 align:start position:0%
um so I'll um
 
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
in a minute I'm going to call him up
 
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
about that but um
 
00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions of Mark of
 
00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
and I was just speaking with assistant
 
00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 align:start position:0%
commissioner I did not know there had
 
00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 align:start position:0%
been I have not seen that analysis don't
 
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
worry about it it's just thick and I
 
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
asked for a copy of it I said we should
 
00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 align:start position:0%
have at least one copy
 
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
okay so we can see it and I believe it's
 
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
at least two reams of paper
 
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
obviously we don't have that copy but it
 
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
has been done so no harm no file that
 
00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
you haven't seen it because quite
 
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
frankly I wasn't able to figure out how
 
00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
to download it because it was so big on
 
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
my computer so large
 
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
did you guys I think it's been sent to
 
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
so thank you you have any questions
 
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah Municipal Association
 
00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner Ogden if you
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:12.189 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
sir um so you you your your folks did go
 
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
through yeah and we've spoken to a few
 
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
um someone from New Hampshire caution
 
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
we've spoken with Miss Burns as well
 
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy to send them a copy just
 
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
one thing and I apologize because
 
00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
they've now heard this explanation and
 
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
they'll hear it again uh to be clear
 
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
what we have uh might be sufficient for
 
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
purposes of a gap analysis in the sense
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
of what it essentially does is it lays
 
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.730 align:start position:0%
of what it essentially does is it lays
out

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
um what OSHA has
 
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
if if there is something in New
 
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on point that is presented
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
right with the corresponding section
 
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
within OSHA so when you go through this
 
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
document and we'll send out directions
 
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
on how to collapse it expand it and all
 
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
of those things but essentially what the
 
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
document is doing is laying out what
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
OSHA has if there's something on point
 
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it presents that if
 
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
there's something not on point in New
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the document highlights that
 
00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 align:start position:0%
fact you will see that there are a lot
 
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
of things that OSHA has that New
 
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has nothing on in terms of
 
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
explicitly stated standard where I would
 
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
point out that I am not sure if it's
 
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
sufficient for purposes of a gap
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
analysis for what the municipal
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
Association is looking for is it does
 
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
not do a side by if there are existing
 
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
standards and there is an OSHA standard
 
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
while it lays them out side by side it
 
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
does not have a corresponding analysis
 
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
of uh which is better which is costly or
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
you know all of those things so I just
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
highlight that fact to not disappoint
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
folks when they ultimate open it I just
 
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
again up front what it is doing is
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
laying those things outside by side but
 
00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
it's not doing a critical eye when they
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
when they each have uh something on
 
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.890 align:start position:0%
when they each have uh something on
point

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
we started the hearing and there were
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
questions from representative soucy
 
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
about this um the word gap or the
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
concept Gap analysis um I believe it was
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
brought up in the
 
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
email that we all received from the
 
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
municipal Association
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
um uh regarding Concord so we had Miss
 
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
Burns in the municipal Association come
 
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
up and and explain the situation
 
00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 align:start position:0%
and then I asked uh assistant
 
00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
commissioner Ogden to discuss some
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
things so that's where we are so chair
 
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
is yours sir
 
00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:30.419 align:start position:0%
thank you and I apologize Interstate 89
 
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
was off
 
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
it was a real disaster but I'm here I
 
00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
took my four-wheel drive which is
 
00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
probably a good idea
 
00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:44.870 align:start position:0%
probably a good idea
um

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
I guess uh one of the things that I'd
 
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
like to uh
 
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
put out there the chairman and I had a
 
00:07:58.129 --> 00:07:58.139 align:start position:0%
exchange of of thoughts over the last uh
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
couple days and um
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:07.139 align:start position:0%
I was I was on the verge of preparing an
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that would have
 
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
um uh extended the
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
um the effective date out until uh
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
summer of 2024.
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh that seemed like it would resolve
 
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
some of the anxieties that folks were
 
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.510 align:start position:0%
some of the anxieties that folks were
experiencing

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
experiencing
 
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
um and then some of the communications
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
that we received were looking for
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
additional uh
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know Gap analysis and and such which
 
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.170 align:start position:0%
you know Gap analysis and and such which
frankly

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
um you know we've we've done a good
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
point well actually I use the term we
 
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
very Loosely um the department did a
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
good job of doing a comparison of the um
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
the OSHA standards and the department of
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
labor standards
 
00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:55.700 align:start position:0%
um that those have not been widely
 
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
distributed uh part of the difficulty is
 
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:02.220 align:start position:0%
that the file that was created was a
 
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
rather immense
 
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
certainly that those can be shared with
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
interested parties so that uh that
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
analysis can be undertaken by others
 
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.949 align:start position:0%
analysis can be undertaken by others
um

00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:15.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
what uh the chairman and myself
 
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:24.380 align:start position:0%
uh were thinking was instead of Simply
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
pushing back the uh
 
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.490 align:start position:0%
pushing back the uh
uh

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:31.019 align:start position:0%
the effective date perhaps it would be
 
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
more effective to retain the bill
 
00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:36.899 align:start position:0%
um when you retain the bill you can
 
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
continue working on it so if essentially
 
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
we would retain it and I did some
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
exploring and the the speaker's office
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
some committees working on retained
 
00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
bills during the session but that's
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
mainly you know committees like
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
education Science and Technology the
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
ones that have huge workloads they don't
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
want them putting their workloads aside
 
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
to work on something else the labor
 
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
committee has the luxury of not having a
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
huge workload in fact this year it's
 
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
actually lighter than usual so I think
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
we would have the ability to um
 
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
to go go to work on it and continue
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
working on it and do some of the things
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
that perhaps the study committee was
 
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
unable to get to
 
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
um but I I will say that uh
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
I'll speak for myself alone I'm I remain
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
very committed to getting these OSHA
 
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.310 align:start position:0%
very committed to getting these OSHA
standards

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
um uh brought into the public sector I
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
think it's critical
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
um I understand that folks want to know
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what it's going to mean
 
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
um but I I firmly believe that this is
 
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
something we need to do
 
00:10:57.889 --> 00:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
um but I'm willing to take the time to
 
00:11:02.569 --> 00:11:02.579 align:start position:0%
work with the stakeholders to uh
 
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
help them understand exactly what the uh
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
what it's going to mean to bring these
 
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
standards into play
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
so effectively what retaining the bill
 
00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:15.899 align:start position:0%
would do is it would give us time to
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
start working now continue working
 
00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:19.790 align:start position:0%
start working now continue working
um

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.069 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
I think we could even work during the
 
00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:25.750 align:start position:0%
I think we could even work during the
summer

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
we ran into some difficulty last year
 
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:31.019 align:start position:0%
the speaker indicated that he did not
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
want Study committees to be working
 
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
during July and August which was
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
a real problem for us but at any rate we
 
00:11:42.009 --> 00:11:42.019 align:start position:0%
can work through the spring
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
through as much of the summer as we can
 
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:47.700 align:start position:0%
into the fall and essentially to retain
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
committees retained bills are generally
 
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
voted on on the first session day in
 
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.769 align:start position:0%
voted on on the first session day in
January

00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
January
 
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
um so it gives us a good chunk of time
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
and frankly what would end up happening
 
00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
is what that bill would be if if the
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
bill passes the house
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
and passes the Senate and gets signed by
 
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:11.459 align:start position:0%
um that would take place in the summer
 
00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:14.339 align:start position:0%
of 2024 which is exactly when I was
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
going to put the I was going to suggest
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
we put the effective date to so we get
 
00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:23.339 align:start position:0%
more time to work
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
um more time to get comfortable with the
 
00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:26.210 align:start position:0%
um more time to get comfortable with the
idea

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:26.220 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
um but we um I mean we don't lose any
 
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.870 align:start position:0%
um but we um I mean we don't lose any
time

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
um over what we would have done so
 
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:36.140 align:start position:0%
um I I throw that out to the
 
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to get your thoughts on
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.889 align:start position:0%
doing this
thoughts

00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I think it's a
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
great idea to continue working with the
 
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:52.700 align:start position:0%
department and stakeholders
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
to ease some of the nerves that we've
 
00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
come across thank you
 
00:12:59.930 --> 00:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
and I'll say the same thing
 
00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:04.019 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a great idea and
 
00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
it'll give everybody more time to
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
realize what is actually going to happen
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
and I do have one question if I may to
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
Mr Ogden
 
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
if you know the answer that's fine if
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
do we really feel do you feel that
 
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
we're that far off from safety standards
 
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
to what Brian wants to bring in is the
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
OSHA standard and just in general I mean
 
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
I can tell you I worked on the fire
 
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
department for 29 years
 
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.650 align:start position:0%
department for 29 years
um

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
we didn't have the OSHA standards but
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
everything that we needed I mean and I
 
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
heard people discuss this uh earlier
 
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
about you know some of these smaller
 
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
towns may not have the equipment if they
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
have to go down into a hole
 
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
um you know tripods and all this stuff
 
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
and I can I could see that some smaller
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
towns may not have that but in your
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
opinion we
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
do you feel that we're really that far
 
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:08.420 align:start position:0%
off from Meeting those OSHA standards
 
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
it's tough to say but what I would say
 
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
is I certainly think that there are
 
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
probably pockets of places how
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
widespread those pockets are I'm I'm not
 
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
sure but I'm certain that there are
 
00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
pockets of places that might be far off
 
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
I think it was referenced earlier the
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
fact that because New Hampshire does not
 
00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
have explicitly stated standards does
 
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
not mean that there is no standards
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
because again individuals be looking at
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
the general duty Clause why I bring that
 
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
up is there could be certain employers
 
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
public employers who whether they don't
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
have compliance staff on hand whether
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
they don't have industry experts you
 
00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
know accessible they might not know
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
where to look for such industry
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
standards or where to you know go and
 
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
try and find what they should be doing
 
00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
and I think those are the instances in
 
00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:56.579 align:start position:0%
which you might be in certain instances
 
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
far off from what OSHA would require so
 
00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
I think it's possible I know that's
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
probably not the most satisfying answer
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
but I think that it is possible that
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
there are instances in which what is
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
happening might be uh might be a ways
 
00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:12.610 align:start position:0%
happening might be uh might be a ways
off

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:12.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
and I think is is this Gap analysis
 
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
takes place it's going to be important
 
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind what you're just saying
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
that uh the department often looks to
 
00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:26.339 align:start position:0%
the OSHA standards when New Hampshire
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
lacks a standard we've
 
00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:31.019 align:start position:0%
discussed the difficulty that that
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
places on employers that you know
 
00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:35.579 align:start position:0%
they're looking at the OSHA standards
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
but the department might look to the
 
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards when there's something
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
that appears to be unsafe and we don't
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
have a standard so
 
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.250 align:start position:0%
have a standard so
um

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
basically we would be the Gap we would
 
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
be filling is the gap between what the
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
employers can see now and what they
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
might be actually expected to
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
um comply with now without necessarily
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
being able to know it is that fair
 
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
I I think that that's fair and one thing
 
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
I would I guess uh preface before we
 
00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
provide this document to folks it's a
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
discussion that we did have certainly in
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
the context of the study committee over
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
the summer is when you look at what is
 
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
not there it it can be quite jarring
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
because you will see all of these
 
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:18.779 align:start position:0%
instances in which New Hampshire does
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
not have anything out there specifically
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
or explicitly stating what the standards
 
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
are but to your point representative
 
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
Sullivan we would look to the general
 
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
duty Clause again use the example of
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
electricity there's different areas out
 
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
there that New Hampshire does not have
 
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
explicitly stated standard that does not
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
mean that it's a complete free-for-all
 
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
it does mean that we don't have
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
explicitly stated standard in lab 1400
 
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
or in two RSA 277 so instead we would be
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
looking at what provides for General the
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
employer having met the general duty
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
which might be us looking to OSHA it
 
00:16:56.329 --> 00:16:56.339 align:start position:0%
might be us looking to building codes it
 
00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:58.259 align:start position:0%
might be us looking to generous
 
00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:00.860 align:start position:0%
generally industry accepted standards
 
00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
but I do highlight that is when you see
 
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
what's not there there is a lot
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
and I guess I've been saying all along
 
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
that that's that's why we really need
 
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
these OSHA standards so that everyone
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
can look to the standards and everyone
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
can see what the expectations are they
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
don't have to wait until an inspector
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
says that's not safe and I'm going to
 
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
you know reference something that's not
 
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
in the uh the rules or not in the
 
00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.289 align:start position:0%
in the uh the rules or not in the
statutes

00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:27.299 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
um to to back me up so
 
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.070 align:start position:0%
um to to back me up so
um

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
oh I'll leave it at that but um
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
any any other thoughts on uh this path
 
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.270 align:start position:0%
any any other thoughts on uh this path
please

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
I I'm fine um working through the summer
 
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
working on the study committee as long
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
as we need to to get this right and
 
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
hopefully get it to pass
 
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
um if that's the right decision
 
00:17:54.169 --> 00:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
but my concern I'm going to bring back
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
is with the dates because if we move
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
this out to next January
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
School the the schools will already have
 
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
their budgets ready so if this is going
 
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
to become a cost that the schools are
 
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
going to have to incur to become
 
00:18:12.409 --> 00:18:12.419 align:start position:0%
compliant although I'm feeling a little
 
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
bit more comfortable about that after
 
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
speaking with a couple of school
 
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.310 align:start position:0%
speaking with a couple of school
districts

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
um we would need to have this
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
information out to them by the fall of
 
00:18:21.049 --> 00:18:21.059 align:start position:0%
2023 so that they can get it into the
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
next budget cycle
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
I think we're in the right time frame
 
00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
for the municipalities to get it into
 
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
their budget cycle which would be voted
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
on in March and then there's no reason
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
why we can't continue having this
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
discussion as we go forward
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
um the the bill will be voted on
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
um if it comes out of the committee
 
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
um in January so we've got time to
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
figure out exactly what the implications
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
of the effective date would be so
 
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we've got a Way Forward
 
00:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
at least
 
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
for the subcommittee
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
oh may I please
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
be um
 
00:19:08.049 --> 00:19:08.059 align:start position:0%
one of my initial
 
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
requests of Representative Sullivan was
 
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.810 align:start position:0%
requests of Representative Sullivan was
a

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:19:14.409 --> 00:19:14.419 align:start position:0%
um a commission and I wanted to
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
specifically outline I wanted one person
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
from fire one police one Municipal City
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
one Municipal Town someone from one of
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
the counties that represents you know
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes the Corrections
 
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
Department all those things so we get
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
these people that each one of these
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
individuals would break down their
 
00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
portion of 1910 and how it would apply
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
to them Brian Appley explained to me
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
that you're right it's very difficult to
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
get a commission by the time you appoint
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
people you can't get a senator to do it
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to find a couple reps to do
 
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:44.990 align:start position:0%
you're going to find a couple reps to do
it

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh it it may take you four months just
 
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
to get people in place it's best to just
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
retain it where you can kind of do the
 
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
because we're going to rely the
 
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
municipal Association to get us the
 
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
people that we want them to get for us
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
right so um and in fact that's so we'll
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
we'll we can we can accomplish the same
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
thing now I did also have a conversation
 
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
with the um assistant commissioner and
 
00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
the commissioner on this
 
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
and because I started questioning some
 
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
of the things that are in 1910 I spoke
 
00:20:18.409 --> 00:20:18.419 align:start position:0%
with the we uh the fire chief of Bedford
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
reached out to Brian and I and we have
 
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
spoken to him
 
00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
yeah he started bringing up things
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
um which you know I I frankly had no
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
knowledge of
 
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
two in two out as a firefighter you
 
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
would know that you know two guys are
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
going in there needs to be at least two
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
guys outside making sure something
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
happened to them and what have you and
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
then I started reading these things
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
about all the reporting
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
there has to be a list written all the
 
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
time of who was doing what and where and
 
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:48.299 align:start position:0%
who was in the hole who was not all
 
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
these different things
 
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.310 align:start position:0%
these different things
um that

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
that leads me to wonder
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
are there things in 1910
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
that because we all know OSHA you know
 
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
great laudable uh organization and when
 
00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:06.299 align:start position:0%
it was started and why it was started
 
00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:08.270 align:start position:0%
it was started and why it was started
and

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
the safety you know with the Brian as
 
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
you know someone was killed uh at Lowe's
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
um in Laconia this week
 
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
um when Lumber fell on him so accidents
 
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
do happen and and that was private
 
00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
versus Municipal but it could it could
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
happen anytime
 
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
so long story short there are things
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
that could neither be done but are there
 
00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
things in 1910 that are really
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
typical government useless that don't do
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
anything that no one's going to ever
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
check that the labor Department's not
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
even going to look at that is going to
 
00:21:41.039 --> 00:21:42.110 align:start position:0%
even going to look at that is going to
cause

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
cause
 
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.870 align:start position:0%
cause
um

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
an undue cost for no benefit and and in
 
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
my email to you as I wrote don't get
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
into the argument of cost versus safety
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
because it's a losing argument yeah um
 
00:21:55.799 --> 00:21:56.930 align:start position:0%
because it's a losing argument yeah um
um

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.370 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:21:58.370 --> 00:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
but there are when I started getting
 
00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
these this feedback from certain people
 
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
as to well we're doing this but if we do
 
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
this it's going to cost a lot more so my
 
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
conversation with the commissioner is
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
this commissioner are in 1910 are there
 
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
things that are covered elsewhere are
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
there things that really
 
00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
um we don't have to
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
we don't feel a really appropriate
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
to do and that's where you know I'm
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
I told you that I cannot look at you in
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
the eye and everybody else and say I
 
00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:30.419 align:start position:0%
want to pass this bill if I don't know
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
all the different things I can't hear
 
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
from everybody so that's where I'm
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
coming from this regarding the budgets
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
we would have our
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
retained report out I believe the rule
 
00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
is going to be November 1st probably
 
00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:48.059 align:start position:0%
that's the the we have to have that
 
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
prepared I don't know that the retained
 
00:22:53.529 --> 00:22:53.539 align:start position:0%
bill has a report necessarily
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
we would have to finish working on the
 
00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:57.419 align:start position:0%
bill and then we'll be voted on in
 
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
January but I think it needs to be
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
I think that work in the retained bills
 
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
does need to be completed right around
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
November we can double check that but
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah but it's right in there because as
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
I was talking with the fire chief he has
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
a problem with some of these things he's
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
like gee well I really don't want to be
 
00:23:18.409 --> 00:23:18.419 align:start position:0%
locked down as a fire as a fire chief
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
um to the two and two because I show up
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
to a fire there's only three of us
 
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
and I really need two guys to go in what
 
00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
am I going to do I'm going to allow one
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
in you know there are certain things
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
that happen in real life versus what's
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
on a piece of paper and that's all I
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
want to get to the bottom of
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
and I guess what uh what I'd like to
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
hear uh what I'd like to do is develop a
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
list of all those folks that we want to
 
00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
be reaching out to
 
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
um to involve
 
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:23:51.649 --> 00:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
in the process going forward between now
 
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
and when uh the bill is uh
 
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
um ready to go
 
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
um so I'd be happy to hear from folks
 
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
who are in the audience who um
 
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
would like to be involved with this
 
00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.529 align:start position:0%
would like to be involved with this
process

00:24:06.529 --> 00:24:06.539 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:24:06.539 --> 00:24:07.370 align:start position:0%
process
um

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.770 align:start position:0%
um
please

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
you don't have any uh pin cards so they
 
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
have to identify yourself for us
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
hey good morning my name is David Ross
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm the administrator of
 
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County nursing home I
 
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
applaud the committee's thoughtful
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
consideration today to retain this bill
 
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
to allow opportunity for more input and
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
discussion about how to properly
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
Implement these changes I would be happy
 
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
to participate in in this discussion
 
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
um and in this work group to be able to
 
00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:40.570 align:start position:0%
um and in this work group to be able to
help

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:40.580 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
strategize because we do see that this
 
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
could potentially have significant
 
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
impact on our nursing home operations
 
00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.770 align:start position:0%
impact on our nursing home operations
specifically

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
um The Gap analysis the the department
 
00:24:54.049 --> 00:24:54.059 align:start position:0%
has prepared will be helpful for us to
 
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
review but it also will require us to do
 
00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
a facility specific Gap analysis to be
 
00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:00.299 align:start position:0%
able to take a look at where does our
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
practice deviate from these new
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
standards and discuss an implementation
 
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
plan specifically
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
much as you shared the Bedford fire
 
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
chief shared the same so
 
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
um I think that that's a great approach
 
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
I applaud your thoughtful consideration
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
here and would love to participate great
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
and if you could leave some contact
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
information that'd be great happy to
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
I'll leave that with uh Kate Horgan
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
who'll get that over to you okay thank
 
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:38.510 align:start position:0%
taking the question
um

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
does anything stand out
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
on first glance that you would be
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
um there was so much to go through
 
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
um I think what we have to really go
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
through is the bloodborne pathogen
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
standards specifically
 
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
um hazardous materials lockout tag out
 
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
all of those components that we have
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
elements of those
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
um in place at our facility I'm just not
 
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
confident that we have full compliance
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
with each of those standards so it
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
really does require such an in-depth
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
review the 1910 standard is over 2200
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
pages so there's so much information and
 
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
detail that's included in there it
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
really warrants a very substantial Deep
 
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.409 align:start position:0%
really warrants a very substantial Deep
dive

00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:18.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
the standard what standards do you
 
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
follow now just general practice or just
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
business industry or whatever that's
 
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
correct yeah that's correct yeah thank
 
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.710 align:start position:0%
correct yeah that's correct yeah thank
you

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:33.059 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:48.059 align:start position:0%
there you go thank you for giving me
 
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
this opportunity
 
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a great idea I believe
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
that it will give the committee the
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hear from voices that
 
00:26:59.570 --> 00:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
they were unable to hear from over the
 
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
summer with the commission committee
 
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.390 align:start position:0%
summer with the commission committee
that

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
um came up this bill came out of I would
 
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that some employees
 
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
public employees from some of the
 
00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539 align:start position:0%
sectors that where employers will be
 
00:27:12.539 --> 00:27:13.789 align:start position:0%
sectors that where employers will be
represented

00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
represented
 
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.649 --> 00:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm a union guy I'm all in
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry can you introduce yourself for
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
me certainly I'm sorry uh my name is

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
anyone else want to weigh in
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
and benefits for the Department of
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
administrative Services over the state
 
00:27:55.919 --> 00:27:56.570 align:start position:0%
administrative Services over the state
um

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
and all of the agencies of the state so
 
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
we would be rolling down two weeks
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
the fact industries that the state
 
00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.049 align:start position:0%
the fact industries that the state
employees

00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:06.059 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
and our budget collect a little bit
 
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
different it sounds like better
 
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
municipalities so I just want to be
 
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
sensitive to that too if you all know
 
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
the state budget services
 
00:28:15.779 --> 00:28:16.970 align:start position:0%
the state budget services
okay

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.230 align:start position:0%
okay
yep

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
is is there anyone other than yourself
 
00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:27.419 align:start position:0%
that might uh be a likely candidate to
 
00:28:27.419 --> 00:28:27.950 align:start position:0%
that might uh be a likely candidate to
um

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.409 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:28:47.409 --> 00:28:47.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
it's so like we would want to talk with
 
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire hospital
 
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.890 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire hospital
um

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.450 align:start position:0%
 
correction

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
correction
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I would definitely want to
 
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
get their perspectives too and that
 
00:29:03.649 --> 00:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
would probably include someone today
 
00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:05.529 align:start position:0%
would probably include someone today
okay

00:29:05.529 --> 00:29:05.539 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
as we move forward we'll probably have
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
to figure out how much of the work
 
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
your department will do with the other
 
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
departments and how much work will
 
00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
actually be done by the subcommittee
 
00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:24.059 align:start position:0%
here so we'll sort that out because it
 
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
might be more time that the subcommittee
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
can actually devote
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and uh but basically you can bring
 
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
some reports to the subcommittee as to
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
what you've uh uncovered and the I agree
 
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
with the comment about can't be funny
 
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:40.740 align:start position:0%
I've been arguing to Trump see totally
 
00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
agree with that oh I just want to think
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
about some of the resources that you
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
variation of Readiness in something that
 
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:54.260 align:start position:0%
is often Republic
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
so we would want to make sure we had
 
00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
those fun things the funding available
 
00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
to start them I don't know where that is
 
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
I know it's not on my radar so I don't
 
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
have a department of administrative
 
00:30:09.659 --> 00:30:11.389 align:start position:0%
have a department of administrative
services

00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
I didn't really answer yeah
 
00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:16.740 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that's good and my
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is the budget is going to
 
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
have enough money for everything
 
00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.810 align:start position:0%
have enough money for everything
everything

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
no question
 
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
Whitman again um for being here with us
 
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
um could you also put a cost analysis as
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
well with some of those
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
um upgrades that you would probably need
 
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
in the assessment of the overall the Gap
 
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
analysis yes
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
yeah a realistic cost from what you have
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
now because
 
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
um a follow-up Mr you can just keep
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
going yeah
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
um we spoke last time about
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
um when you got when D.O.T is working on
 
00:31:00.049 --> 00:31:00.059 align:start position:0%
Bridges they follow industry standards
 
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
how far off are those industry standards
 
00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
from the 1910. so if they already have
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
um policies procedures in place that
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
almost mirror those would that be a
 
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.430 align:start position:0%
almost mirror those would that be a
large

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:31:12.289 --> 00:31:12.299 align:start position:0%
okay you know undertaking for them to do
 
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
that or just I'm which I'm just doing
 
00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
the bridge thing because you know we all
 
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
see those happening
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay stuff like that and we'll keep the
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittee in the loop too as what
 
00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
we're learning yes thank you thank you
 
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and I guess one of the please
 
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
um while you're coming up one of the
 
00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:36.299 align:start position:0%
other things that keeps coming back to
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
me in our many conversations with the
 
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner of Labor is uh the
 
00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:45.419 align:start position:0%
manner in which that the department
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
works is not um we're looking for
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
violations so that we can rake in the
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
the fines
 
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:55.740 align:start position:0%
um the way the department works is when
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
we um when we find a violation we work
 
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
with the employer to resolve it
 
00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
um and if it if in some cases that means
 
00:32:06.179 --> 00:32:06.830 align:start position:0%
um and if it if in some cases that means
um

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's not the the resolution is going to
 
00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:12.539 align:start position:0%
cost a few bucks that's not in the
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
current budget and we're going to work
 
00:32:15.889 --> 00:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
with you to come up with an interim
 
00:32:15.899 --> 00:32:17.630 align:start position:0%
with you to come up with an interim
resolution

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:32:21.289 --> 00:32:21.299 align:start position:0%
um that keeps folks safe but operates
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
within the current budget uh and and
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
they they do that now with the current
 
00:32:30.049 --> 00:32:30.059 align:start position:0%
uh standards so it's there's
 
00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'm confident they will continue
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
operating the same way we're simply
 
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
giving a more detailed set of standards
 
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
for everyone to be aware of so identify
 
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
yourself please
 
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone I'm Colin Tiernan

00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
perspectives so uh love to help
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
departments you got it thank you
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes please just since this
 
00:33:17.289 --> 00:33:17.299 align:start position:0%
gentleman has
 
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
come up to speak
 
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
in particular obviously you've had
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
conversations about this bill you've had
 
00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:27.539 align:start position:0%
conversations about 1910. could you give
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
me one or two specific hot points that
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
your group or or you and individually
 
00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
um have concerned with or are
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
extremely happy with just give us an
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
idea of where you're coming from
 
00:33:42.649 --> 00:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
I'd say the workers at the Department of
 
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
Transportation and Department of
 
00:33:45.529 --> 00:33:45.539 align:start position:0%
Corrections I definitely would love to
 
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
pull them in I don't have any specific
 
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
heartaches or or or
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
um or examples but I think like in
 
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
general I think those are two
 
00:33:54.889 --> 00:33:54.899 align:start position:0%
departments that I would love to help
 
00:33:59.570 --> 00:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:08.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.369 --> 00:34:10.379 align:start position:0%
are there others who would like to uh
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
um well I think what we'll be doing is
 
00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:19.619 align:start position:0%
uh developing lists of folks that we
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
want to rope in and uh participate and I
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
think we've got a good start here
 
00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.950 align:start position:0%
think we've got a good start here
um but

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.510 align:start position:0%
um but
um

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
this is work that I think we would have
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
liked to have done with the study
 
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.329 align:start position:0%
liked to have done with the study
committee

00:34:34.329 --> 00:34:34.339 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately that that started too
 
00:34:42.129 --> 00:34:42.139 align:start position:0%
late which is why I did uh press
 
00:34:46.609 --> 00:34:46.619 align:start position:0%
uh chairman infantine that uh
 
00:34:49.609 --> 00:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
things that slow study committees and
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
commissions down
 
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
um keeping this is a retained Bill the
 
00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
labor committee owns it the labor
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
committee keeps it the labor committee
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
remains responsible for it we don't have
 
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
to find a senator to play along
 
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
um we uh great respect for the Senate
 
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
but we we can continue working without
 
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
having to uh deal with the uh the
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
impediments that our legislative process
 
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
often creates so
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
um looking forward to it
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
any other thoughts before we
 
00:35:29.089 --> 00:35:29.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
I'd be delighted to hear a motion uh
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I move that the
 
00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:43.700 align:start position:0%
subcommittee adopts
 
00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
retained status for this bill
 
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
and I'll second that motion okay
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
um and we've got four committee members
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
um I would I guess I'll just do a roll
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
call vote
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
representative Holcomb
 
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
yes representative Susie representative
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
avalani yes and representative Sullivan
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
votes yes as well so basically we have a
 
00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:10.619 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote to uh and just to be
 
00:36:10.619 --> 00:36:11.690 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote to uh and just to be
clear

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
um representative inventine is not uh
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
part of the subcommittee uh we
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate him being here and um on the
 
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
phone I told him that we would hope that
 
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
he would be the Perpetual fifth member
 
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
um and continue to uh uh provide his uh
 
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
thoughts and input as we move forward
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
um because we're pretty much evenly
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
divided in the house we've got evenly
 
00:36:37.609 --> 00:36:37.619 align:start position:0%
divided committees and subcommittees um
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
but um I think we will have a technical
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
five member group moving forward
 
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:46.730 align:start position:0%
um so
um

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
I will fill out the necessary paperwork
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
and will bring us back to the committee
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
I believe on the 16th correct
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:36:58.079 --> 00:36:59.870 align:start position:0%
yes okay
perfect

00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much folks and I guess
 
00:37:04.609 --> 00:37:04.619 align:start position:0%
in 15 minutes the other subcommittee
 
00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:14.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
hold on
 
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.089 --> 00:37:43.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:28.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%

therapeutic cannabis program and uh
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
let's go around and representative
 
00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:57.900 align:start position:0%

okay

00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:05.579 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:05.579 --> 00:56:06.950 align:start position:0%
okay
anyway

00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
um we've we've had some discussion on it
 
00:56:10.329 --> 00:56:10.339 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:56:13.609 --> 00:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
does does anybody have uh any further
 
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
ideas that uh that they've thought of
 
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
I think one of one of the things that um
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
I think is is
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
most uh telling for me is the court case
 
00:56:31.559 --> 00:56:33.049 align:start position:0%
most uh telling for me is the court case
um

00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:33.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
knowing that the courts have already
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
pretty much determined that you have to
 
00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.650 align:start position:0%
pretty much determined that you have to
um

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
that firing somebody for
 
00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis use
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
um is is not allowed but
 
00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
not having the law to actually you know
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
guide that
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
concept I really think it's it becomes
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
more critical that we we put something
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
together here that that works because uh
 
00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
um someone shouldn't have to make their
 
00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
way through the court system in order to
 
00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
um you have the rights preserved so I I
 
00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
it just seems critical that we we do put
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
something in place here
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
we did just receive an email that looks
 
00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
like it shows the laws in the different
 
00:57:32.569 --> 00:57:32.579 align:start position:0%
states so I have not had a chance to
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
review that I'm just scanning it now
 
00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.650 align:start position:0%
review that I'm just scanning it now
um

00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:38.540 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
I still am one who
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
has an issue with cannabis use in the
 
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
workplace and I also have an issue with
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that we would be restricting
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
employers from how they feel
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
um they need to manage their their staff
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
and their business
 
00:57:57.599 --> 00:57:59.990 align:start position:0%
and their business
so

00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
I'm hesitant on
 
00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
the direction of this one
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
I know for myself
 
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:12.890 align:start position:0%
I know for myself
um

00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
I have concerns about the the liability
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
if an accident happens uh in a in a
 
00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.849 align:start position:0%
if an accident happens uh in a in a
workplace

00:58:19.849 --> 00:58:19.859 align:start position:0%
workplace
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
um you know the uh I I know of a case a
 
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
long time ago where it's going to be 30
 
00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
years ago where a man lost and I and
 
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
when he uh went to the hospital
 
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
in a cigarette pack he had a couple
 
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
joints in the cigarette pack in the
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
north sarit and uh the insurance company
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
denied coverage and I don't want any
 
00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:41.569 align:start position:0%
denied coverage and I don't want any
um

00:58:41.569 --> 00:58:41.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
any employer to be on the hook for that
 
00:58:47.089 --> 00:58:47.099 align:start position:0%
um you know I we've
 
00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:50.339 align:start position:0%
passing this prior prior to to fixing
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
the liability laws for it would be a
 
00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:53.930 align:start position:0%
the liability laws for it would be a
mistake

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:54.710 align:start position:0%
mistake
um

00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know would you have to get into the
 
00:58:59.329 --> 00:58:59.339 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage end of it and uh you
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
know there's there's unintended
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
consequences I guess is uh is my problem
 
00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
with this and uh you know not not that I
 
00:59:09.049 --> 00:59:09.059 align:start position:0%
I don't like the idea of the law
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
but um to to take um taking employers
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
rights away
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
like Roche said you know the the rights
 
00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
how they're going to conduct their
 
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
business and the liability
 
00:59:23.329 --> 00:59:23.339 align:start position:0%
um I think this is uh this bill is a
 
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
little premature until we until we fix
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.549 --> 00:59:31.559 align:start position:0%
representative Mr chairman
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to look at it from a different
 
00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.069 align:start position:0%
I'm going to look at it from a different
perspective

00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:59:34.079 --> 00:59:36.470 align:start position:0%
perspective
um

00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
I think

00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
I hear everybody's concerns
 
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
but I also feel that
 
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
there is probably use of opioids
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
um in the workplace
 
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
um today
 
00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:53.579 align:start position:0%
um which somebody probably really needs
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
to be using them
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
and they could be using them at work
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
they could be using them when they're
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
driving a forklift and we don't know
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
that at this point
 
01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.470 align:start position:0%
that at this point
um

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:08.809 --> 01:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
and again I think with the I think the
 
01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:11.420 align:start position:0%
misconception here with the cannabis use
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
and I said this last week
 
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
I don't believe for one second that
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
people that are on the therapeutic
 
01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.510 align:start position:0%
people that are on the therapeutic
cannabis

01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.410 align:start position:0%
cannabis
um

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
looking to
 
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
and I'll use this Loosely be Stoners
 
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
because I don't think that's what they
 
01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
really want I think they're looking for
 
01:00:31.849 --> 01:00:31.859 align:start position:0%
some relief
 
01:00:31.859 --> 01:00:32.630 align:start position:0%
some relief
um

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
from the medical issues that they may
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
have trying to get outside of the realm
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
of using opioids and I think if we look
 
01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.750 align:start position:0%
of using opioids and I think if we look
around

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:00:45.069 --> 01:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
every state around us
 
01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
is legalizing marijuana
 
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
we have a bill here
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
um that we'll see where that goes but
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
it's being legalized and the one thing
 
01:00:57.289 --> 01:00:57.299 align:start position:0%
that I don't see
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
from around all these other states
 
01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.430 align:start position:0%
from around all these other states
um

01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
people talked about when Colorado First
 
01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
legalized marijuana and the problems
 
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
they were having well
 
01:01:11.809 --> 01:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
I don't see on the news every night any
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
issues with
 
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
um other states talking about issues
 
01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
that they're experiencing with cannabis
 
01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.630 align:start position:0%
that they're experiencing with cannabis
use

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
so I think the people that are in this
 
01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:27.059 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:30.059 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say that I believe that
 
01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
fact that they probably use it
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
um at night before they go to bed to
 
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
help them sleep to help them take away
 
01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
it's guaranteed that if they would be
 
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
tested the next morning they would have
 
01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:47.339 align:start position:0%
some sort of it would be in the system
 
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
but it does not
 
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
for one second mean that those people
 
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
are impaired it's kind of like alcohol
 
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
alcohol will go through your system but
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
I think representative a former
 
01:01:58.730 --> 01:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
representative kenrik explained it very
 
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
well the way that cannabis
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
um it goes into the body and is you know
 
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
goes through the body slower and that's
 
01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
why you know you get the positive test a
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
lot of times so I
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'm all on board with trying to get
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
something that we can use here to help
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
these folks out
 
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to shut them out because
 
01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
I truly believe that they want to get
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
back into the workforce
 
01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
um I think there was some information
 
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
that was brought forward to us that's
 
01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
helpful I think we look at what other
 
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
states are doing but I do truly believe
 
01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:36.299 align:start position:0%
that there is a way to do this I just
 
01:02:37.849 --> 01:02:37.859 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer right now today
 
01:02:37.859 --> 01:02:39.049 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer right now today
but

01:02:39.049 --> 01:02:39.059 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:39.710 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:42.059 align:start position:0%
I truly do believe that we can do this
 
01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
without it really being a big issue so
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
thank you representative you know
 
01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:49.859 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of uh talk about
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
cavouts which different occupations and
 
01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
stuff and uh you know that that might be
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
an Avenue we might want to go down and
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
um you know uh you know the safety
 
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
concerns and what have you
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:06.299 align:start position:0%
it's uh you know it'll require some work
 
01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
because I've done a lot more a lot more
 
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
time than what we have here but um
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's something we we could
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
look at but once again those uh you know
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
the the insurance and the but the
 
01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
liability end of it um you know
 
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
um I've got a lot of concerns there
 
01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:27.059 align:start position:0%
and um you know I don't I don't want to
 
01:03:29.569 --> 01:03:29.579 align:start position:0%
see somebody who's uh taking a second
 
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
mortgage out on their home to put a
 
01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
business together only to to lose it if
 
01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:36.839 align:start position:0%
there's an industrial accident and uh
 
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
find out that they're not covered
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
because their employees on the the
 
01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:42.299 align:start position:0%
Cannabis um
 
01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
card system you know a program we've got
 
01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
to look into that I think it's a great
 
01:03:50.569 --> 01:03:50.579 align:start position:0%
build a great idea but I think it's
 
01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:54.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I I think there
 
01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
I think there's a combination of a lot
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
of facts here and if anyone has not read
 
01:04:09.289 --> 01:04:09.299 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
um I really recommend they do
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
what you have to do
 
01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
to in order to
 
01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:19.930 align:start position:0%
to in order to
um

01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:19.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:23.329 --> 01:04:23.339 align:start position:0%
become employed with someone and to be
 
01:04:25.849 --> 01:04:25.859 align:start position:0%
able to use therapeutic cannabis
 
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a sign off by the
 
01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.210 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a sign off by the
employer

01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:04:31.609 --> 01:04:31.619 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things you cannot
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
do by rule
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
driving Vehicles using Machinery doing
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
all these things
 
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.630 align:start position:0%
all these things
um

01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.309 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
um being an insurance guy I respect what
 
01:04:44.809 --> 01:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
but I don't know as if because the
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
employer has the ability prior to
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
signing off
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
to present that to their insurance
 
01:04:55.609 --> 01:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
carrier for approval or not this is what
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
this person is going to do and and we we
 
01:05:00.289 --> 01:05:00.299 align:start position:0%
have it happens all the time in my
 
01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
business or someone says I want to hire
 
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
somebody but they had a DWI three years
 
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
ago am I going to be able to allow them
 
01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:07.140 align:start position:0%
to drive a service ban some insurance
 
01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
carriers say yes some say no we submit
 
01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
it to them and if they give it a thumbs
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
up then they can drive if not they can't
 
01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.690 align:start position:0%
up then they can drive if not they can't
so

01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
um you know the owner has that ability
 
01:05:16.799 --> 01:05:20.150 align:start position:0%
um you know the owner has that ability
the

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
I'm overly concerned with some of the
 
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
things that are being brought forth in
 
01:05:25.849 --> 01:05:25.859 align:start position:0%
this committee we have two bills if you
 
01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
think about it out of 13 bills we have
 
01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:30.289 align:start position:0%
think about it out of 13 bills we have
two

01:05:30.289 --> 01:05:30.299 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:05:30.299 --> 01:05:32.150 align:start position:0%
two
where

01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
the bill tries to
 
01:05:41.089 --> 01:05:41.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.099 --> 01:05:42.650 align:start position:0%
 
fired

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
fired
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
for a certain Behavior
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm very cautious about that
 
01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:48.740 align:start position:0%
slippery slope
 
01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:52.220 align:start position:0%
employers can it's an at-will state
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
you look at me funny someday and I don't
 
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
like it and I can let you go some people
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
have a real hard time with that they
 
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
don't like that at all so you're right
 
01:06:02.569 --> 01:06:02.579 align:start position:0%
guys we have to come in between the
 
01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
Middle here
 
01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:05.030 align:start position:0%
Middle here
um

01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
but this bill says you cannot be fired
 
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
just because you have a positive test
 
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
the test doesn't mean that you're
 
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
intoxicated with THC
 
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
it just says you can't be fired for a
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
positive test now
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:29.099 align:start position:0%
why would anyone test someone
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
they know
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
is on therapeutic marijuana because they
 
01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
I don't know why they would bother they
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
know what their results going to be
 
01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.789 align:start position:0%
know what their results going to be
um

01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:45.529 --> 01:06:45.539 align:start position:0%
then you look at the amount of people
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
that are employed in the state of New
 
01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:49.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I don't really want to
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
take away 4 000 people's jobs you know I
 
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want them to be released and
 
01:06:56.569 --> 01:06:56.579 align:start position:0%
I'm glad 4 000 people are
 
01:06:59.890 --> 01:06:59.900 align:start position:0%
um employed in using therapeutic
 
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
marijuana so I I think
 
01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:06.299 align:start position:0%
you have to look at all of the different
 
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
things that are there the employer makes
 
01:07:11.089 --> 01:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
a decision you know and and what I just
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
said about I'm very worried about a
 
01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
slippery slope about
 
01:07:17.329 --> 01:07:17.339 align:start position:0%
letting people go and legislature
 
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
starting to mandate when employers can
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
and cannot let someone go
 
01:07:21.599 --> 01:07:23.569 align:start position:0%
and cannot let someone go
but

01:07:23.569 --> 01:07:23.579 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:25.619 align:start position:0%
um this one seems to be a little more
 
01:07:25.619 --> 01:07:28.609 align:start position:0%
um this one seems to be a little more
voluntary

01:07:28.609 --> 01:07:28.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
they have to sign off on this
 
01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
they don't have to
 
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
and I I want to see if I can get someone
 
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
to come up and ask some questions
 
01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:42.299 align:start position:0%
afterwards if I could they don't have to
 
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
sign that letter
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
01:07:50.089 --> 01:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
now you say sorry you know don't
 
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to agree to it and then so
 
01:07:53.819 --> 01:07:58.309 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to agree to it and then so
um

01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
you know that we're unlike this other
 
01:08:03.049 --> 01:08:03.059 align:start position:0%
other bills where it says well you can't
 
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
let someone go because of X I can't
 
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
think of an example right now so I can't
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
think of an analogy but
 
01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:09.650 align:start position:0%
think of an analogy but
um

01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know the employer agreed to it can
 
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
the employer at one point say and I
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
think these are some of the questions I
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
have so I I hire because I because what
 
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative Souci says is very
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
accurate we have a former state
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative who's a friend of mine
 
01:08:26.209 --> 01:08:26.219 align:start position:0%
he was a paratrooper in the military
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
and he hurt his back
 
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
uh in in the military from jump out of
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
planes and they had this guy so high on
 
01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.490 align:start position:0%
planes and they had this guy so high on
opioids

01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
opioids
 
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
and he was going to die he came home one
 
01:08:38.809 --> 01:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
day and told his wife I'm gonna die
 
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
if I keep doing this and he went cold
 
01:08:43.849 --> 01:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
turkey off the opioids and and started
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
smoking marijuana I think he's one of
 
01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
the first people to get the uh the
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
medical card
 
01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:52.020 align:start position:0%
and he's very happy right now and he's
 
01:08:54.169 --> 01:08:54.179 align:start position:0%
so much better off than when I first met
 
01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
the man
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
and so I have to look at those things
 
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
this saved this guy's life
 
01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
and he works
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
um at a at a place he's a baker uh and
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh his employer so I I have to look at
 
01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
some of the positives of this I will
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
also be a real realistic about politics
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
and being what it is
 
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
because we can all make our own
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
decisions here in the committee which is
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
fine but as I told representative
 
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
Sullivan on the phone yesterday
 
01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:31.259 align:start position:0%
we had an overwhelming majority of
 
01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
people in the house a significant
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
majority I don't say overwhelming a
 
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
significant majority allow the state
 
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:09:43.249 --> 01:09:43.259 align:start position:0%
uh recreational marijuana last week
 
01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
okay I was not one of them
 
01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.289 align:start position:0%
okay I was not one of them
um

01:09:48.289 --> 01:09:48.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
if this committee comes out
 
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
this is one of my concerns as the
 
01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
chairman if this committee comes out and
 
01:09:56.689 --> 01:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
this thing is an Ito
 
01:09:58.729 --> 01:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
I can pretty much guarantee you
 
01:10:00.169 --> 01:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
someone's going to stand up on the house
 
01:10:00.179 --> 01:10:01.070 align:start position:0%
someone's going to stand up on the house
floor

01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
and they're going to challenge it and
 
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
there's probably enough votes to
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
override what this committee would want
 
01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
to do if this committee comes out with a
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
negative report based on what happened
 
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
um with the last uh vote in the house
 
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
so my thought process is is maybe this
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
is more
 
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
being too much of a politician in me but
 
01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
I'd rather figure out what the bill is
 
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
going to be we better make it really
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
good because if it's not and you don't
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
like it and it passes then you're
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with that so just something to
 
01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
keep in the back your mind and I'll shut
 
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
up because I'm not on this committee I
 
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
just don't but I would like to ask a
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for what you're
 
01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:46.850 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for what you're
saying

01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
um with all due respect I would like to
 
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
correct one thing the bill doesn't Focus
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
just on the firing it actually it also
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
has in there that an employer cannot
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
hire if somebody tests positive
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's a piece that's
 
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
very risky because they don't know
 
01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
anything about this person so they're
 
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
they're hiring on good faith through an
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
interview or process and a testing
 
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
process and I
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying as far as the
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
votes as well I think that piece the
 
01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
very least needs to be removed they
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
should be able to have be free to make a
 
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
decision on hiring practices and not
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
have this hanging over their head as a
 
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
potential discrimination lawsuit that
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
they were chosen not to be hired because
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
they tested positive
 
01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
um so from that perspective and you know
 
01:11:33.649 --> 01:11:33.659 align:start position:0%
I'd like to share what I witnessed on
 
01:11:36.169 --> 01:11:36.179 align:start position:0%
Monday now I personally
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
have never used cannabis so I can't say
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
for certain what I saw is actually what
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
I saw but I was sitting at the lights
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
coming off of Route 89 and next to me in
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
the vehicle was a person smoking what
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
appeared to me as a joint and she's like
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
I didn't look like a Marlboro it did not
 
01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
it did not it had a distinct look to it
 
01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
so it could have been a homemade
 
01:11:59.570 --> 01:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
cigarette so I'll give that but it
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
certainly looked like a joint that she
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
was smoking while she was sitting at the
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
lights and I immediately thought of this
 
01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
saying and the testimony that we heard
 
01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
about people know that they're not
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to do this and if she was on
 
01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
her lunch break or if she was on her way
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
to work you know it begs the question
 
01:12:17.410 --> 01:12:17.420 align:start position:0%
and you know it also
 
01:12:19.729 --> 01:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
justifies the concern of our Police
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
Department when they say you know this
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
is a problem because we cannot test the
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
level of
 
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
um intoxic
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
intoxication from
 
01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.410 align:start position:0%
intoxication from
um

01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
didn't share this last week but uh just
 
01:12:51.169 --> 01:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
took this out of my wallet it is in New
 
01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis registry card
 
01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.189 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis registry card
um

01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm bringing it up today is
 
01:12:57.719 --> 01:12:59.470 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm bringing it up today is
because

01:12:59.470 --> 01:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
I'll also say that I
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
tried the Cannabis exactly once it
 
01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:07.990 align:start position:0%
tried the Cannabis exactly once it
didn't

01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
agree with me
 
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
um I won't go into details and I'm
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
frankly not going to say why I was using
 
01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
it but I do have the card and the reason
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
I bring it up is because one of the
 
01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:23.060 align:start position:0%
pieces of Education that I got in
 
01:13:26.209 --> 01:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
considering and deciding to go that
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
direction is that
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose is not to be intoxicated
 
01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
the purpose is to use
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
just enough to deal with the symptoms
 
01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:39.179 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to address
 
01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
and it's different from that person
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
who's in the car who uh smoking a joint
 
01:13:47.209 --> 01:13:47.219 align:start position:0%
that person is smoking a joint for the
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
sole purpose of becoming intoxicated
 
01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.470 align:start position:0%
sole purpose of becoming intoxicated
um

01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:52.810 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:52.820 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:55.070 --> 01:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
serves a much different purpose it is
 
01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
there it it is being used to deal with
 
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
symptoms not to create intoxication
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
so um and and basically one of the
 
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
people I talked to when I was
 
01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
considering This was
 
01:14:13.610 --> 01:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
um Dr canurk
 
01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
um former representative knurk and you
 
01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
know he explained very carefully to me
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
the the trick is to get just enough to
 
01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
deal with your um symptoms and there's
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
no intention of being intoxicated so I
 
01:14:31.729 --> 01:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
think I think that needs to be very
 
01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
clear to us if someone is has got the
 
01:14:38.450 --> 01:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
card they're being counseled to uh to
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
use it in that manner so um and that's
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
that's different
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
um so I I do want to put a bill forward
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
frankly I'm comfortable with the amended
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
version that we had
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
um uh last time we met but I'm also open
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
to modifications of that
 
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
um if the subcommittee or some of the
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
folks who are here can suggest
 
01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
modifications to it that would make it
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh more effective more palatable
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm good with that but I believe uh
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm I'm going to be pragmatic
 
01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
like uh chairman infantein as being
 
01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.030 align:start position:0%
like uh chairman infantein as being
um

01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
something where we're going to end up
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
with something let's make it as good as
 
01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
we can so
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
um but let's separate the uh
 
01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
recreational use of cannabis from the
 
01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use of cannabis they're two
 
01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
different things and serve two very
 
01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
one of my problems would be how
 
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
um how do we separate it there
 
01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
representative Susie was talking uh he's
 
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
you know talking how you know most of
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
these people will certainly just use
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
them to therapy therapeutic use and and
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you know that that there are
 
01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
certainly people with those with those
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
cards that are abusing it too
 
01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
um how do we separate them uh you know
 
01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
what what kind of language can we put in
 
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
that separate
 
01:16:15.169 --> 01:16:15.179 align:start position:0%
you know how can we allow an employer to
 
01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
say look at you know you're going
 
01:16:18.649 --> 01:16:18.659 align:start position:0%
overboard with this
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
um I I think the language of the bill is
 
01:16:21.719 --> 01:16:23.030 align:start position:0%
um I I think the language of the bill is
clear

01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
um if someone is impaired
 
01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
um at work
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
because they're drinking because they're
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
using opioids or because they're using
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
um cannabis to the point of becoming
 
01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
impaired you can be fired for that
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section shall be
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
construed to require an employer to
 
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
allow being impaired by cannabis
 
01:16:46.689 --> 01:16:46.699 align:start position:0%
products while at work
 
01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
so basically if the employee is impaired
 
01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:52.610 align:start position:0%
so basically if the employee is impaired
that's

01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:53.209 align:start position:0%
that's
um

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
grounds for uh
 
01:16:59.930 --> 01:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
action on the part of the employer
 
01:17:01.729 --> 01:17:01.739 align:start position:0%
but she can't prove it
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
you know there's no tests that that it
 
01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
says whether I smoked a joint a week and
 
01:17:09.649 --> 01:17:09.659 align:start position:0%
a half ago or 20 minutes ago
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
um you know in in my judgment he was
 
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
impaired won't stand up in court
 
01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
you know it won't stand up before the
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
labor board
 
01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.890 align:start position:0%
labor board
um

01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know this is the the hurdle we have
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
they think think that was put in there
 
01:17:28.729 --> 01:17:28.739 align:start position:0%
to Simply to to clearly answer that
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
issue if a person is impaired that's not
 
01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.890 align:start position:0%
issue if a person is impaired that's not
okay

01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
um and um I did Labor Relations long
 
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
enough that I represented folks that
 
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
were impaired in various ways and when
 
01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
they were there are consequences often
 
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
there was counseling involved
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
um but basically being impaired at work
 
01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:53.630 align:start position:0%
um but basically being impaired at work
um

01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
is not okay and not allowed under this
 
01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:59.630 align:start position:0%
is not okay and not allowed under this
bill

01:17:59.630 --> 01:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
I still can't understand how a case like
 
01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:04.739 align:start position:0%
that would stand up in
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
any Labor Board hearing or a court of
 
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
law uh because you can't prove like I
 
01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
said whether I smoke that joint a week
 
01:18:16.729 --> 01:18:16.739 align:start position:0%
and a half ago about 20 minutes ago
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
that in my opinion wouldn't for from
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
somebody who's uh
 
01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
who's not an alcohol and drug counselor
 
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
for instance uh you know as a witness
 
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
wouldn't hold up
 
01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
um you know in in litigation
 
01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:38.219 align:start position:0%
let me play it out is what I would have
 
01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
experienced as a labor rep representing
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
an employee who
 
01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
um was impaired at work or allegedly
 
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
imperative work
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
um if that employee was disciplined or
 
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
terminated because of that
 
01:18:56.770 --> 01:18:56.780 align:start position:0%
um a grievance would be filed
 
01:18:58.850 --> 01:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
that grievance would go through the
 
01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
process of the various administrative
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
levels would go to the school board and
 
01:19:05.689 --> 01:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
if the grievance was denied at all those
 
01:19:07.729 --> 01:19:07.739 align:start position:0%
various levels would end up before an
 
01:19:07.739 --> 01:19:08.810 align:start position:0%
various levels would end up before an
arbitrator

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
arbitrator
 
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
that arbitrator would have a hearing and
 
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
at that hearing the person who observed
 
01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
the impairment would be questioned in
 
01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
detail as to what they observed
 
01:19:20.219 --> 01:19:21.590 align:start position:0%
detail as to what they observed
and

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
basically arbitrators operate by the
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
sniff test if it's
 
01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
if it smells like bologna it's probably
 
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
bologna and so essentially they're going
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
to go in The credibility of uh the uh
 
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
the employee versus The credibility of
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
the supervisor and
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
I had lots of experiences where
 
01:19:44.050 --> 01:19:44.060 align:start position:0%
arbitrators sided with the employer
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
because they believed that the employee
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
was indeed doing what the employer
 
01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
alleged so it is not impossible to uh to
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
deal with something like this in fact if
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
if it's not a union environment it's
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
much easier because basically they're
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
the only recourse there is to the courts
 
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
the judge would do the same thing
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
um question very carefully what the
 
01:20:14.050 --> 01:20:14.060 align:start position:0%
person observed what they saw what they
 
01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
witnessed and reach a conclusion
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
um and and basically under this law the
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
judge would be looking over the
 
01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
arbitrator would be looking
 
01:20:25.729 --> 01:20:25.739 align:start position:0%
um to say that just because you've got a
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
card doesn't mean you can be impaired at
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
work this says very specifically it is
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
not allowed to be impaired at work so um
 
01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
I think this uh this bill does it it in
 
01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
in and basically with regard to the
 
01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
hiring situation
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
it says no employer shall deny
 
01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
employment terminate or take
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action solely because
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
if you decide to um not hire somebody
 
01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
for any you know there when you do an
 
01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:57.610 align:start position:0%
for any you know there when you do an
interview

01:20:57.610 --> 01:20:57.620 align:start position:0%
interview
 
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
you learn a lot about that uh potential
 
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:02.890 align:start position:0%
you learn a lot about that uh potential
employee

01:21:02.890 --> 01:21:02.900 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
and you could choose any one of a dozen
 
01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
other factors that cause you to choose
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
not to hire that individual just because
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
the person has a therapeutic cannabis
 
01:21:17.630 --> 01:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
card doesn't mean you have to hire them
 
01:21:20.689 --> 01:21:20.699 align:start position:0%
it simply means you can't decide not to
 
01:21:23.209 --> 01:21:23.219 align:start position:0%
hire them solely because they've got the
 
01:21:23.219 --> 01:21:24.050 align:start position:0%
hire them solely because they've got the
card

01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
card
 
01:21:27.169 --> 01:21:27.179 align:start position:0%
so you don't say that at all what's that
 
01:21:27.179 --> 01:21:29.229 align:start position:0%
so you don't say that at all what's that
yeah

01:21:29.229 --> 01:21:29.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say you can't hire anything
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a card
 
01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
it's it's only because the individual is
 
01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
a qualifying patient of the New
 
01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's the card okay I apologize I was
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
reading something else I I misspoke
 
01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
sorry Brian okay I apologize it's okay
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
um so so basically it's only because
 
01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
they've got the card or solely because
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
of a positive drug test but but
 
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
basically you can terminate the employee
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
for a dozen other reasons you can choose
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
not to hire the employee for a dozen
 
01:22:02.570 --> 01:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
other reasons it's just you cannot base
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
that decision solely on those two
 
01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:08.689 align:start position:0%
that decision solely on those two
factors

01:22:08.689 --> 01:22:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
representative Susie okay thank you Mr
 
01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:13.250 align:start position:0%
representative Susie okay thank you Mr
chairman

01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
I think we need to understand as well
 
01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:16.250 align:start position:0%
I think we need to understand as well
that

01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
these committees are policy committees
 
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
and it's our job to put together
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
um legislation that is good legislation
 
01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
and we are not going to decide and we
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
can't decide as to what a judge may
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
think or an arbitrator may think
 
01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:35.330 align:start position:0%
think or an arbitrator may think
um

01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's I just it's
 
01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
up to us to put the legislation forward
 
01:22:42.169 --> 01:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
and I agree with what representative
 
01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
Sullivan said I think this is pretty
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
clear that they're saying that
 
01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
impairment is not allowed at the
 
01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:49.550 align:start position:0%
impairment is not allowed at the
workplace

01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
workplace
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
um so as a policy committee we've moved
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
the policy forward it's not our job to
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
worry about it is our job to look at
 
01:22:59.450 --> 01:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
what um
 
01:23:01.729 --> 01:23:01.739 align:start position:0%
the results could be but at the end of
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
the day we can't decide for a judge or
 
01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
an arbitrator mediator whatever what
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to do and how they're
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
going to decide something but I think I
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
like the bill I mean I'd be open to
 
01:23:16.729 --> 01:23:16.739 align:start position:0%
um modification I know there's going to
 
01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
be exemptions I mean right off the bat I
 
01:23:20.689 --> 01:23:20.699 align:start position:0%
mean I can look at jobs like the fire
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
department police CDL Drivers those I
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
mean obviously those are not going to
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
work under this bill but
 
01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of moving something forward
 
01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chairman
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
who uh my my only thing with moving
 
01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
something forward uh you know we're
 
01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
putting put a lot of time into this so
 
01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
far and there's going to be a lot more
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
um we don't want to just hand it to the
 
01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
Senate and have them kill it uh you know
 
01:23:49.729 --> 01:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
my time all our time is more valuable
 
01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
than that
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative cologne thank you
 
01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
um by May with representative Sullivan's
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
comments regarding hiring
 
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
um it's been my practice that when
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
somebody in a hiring process when
 
01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
somebody is set for a drug screening
 
01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
test it is done with a job offer here is
 
01:24:11.689 --> 01:24:11.699 align:start position:0%
your job offer and the job officer
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
office offer is contingent upon passing
 
01:24:16.490 --> 01:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
a drug screen
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
so if the drug screen happens and they
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
do come back positive with cannabis and
 
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
then the job offer is retracted and it
 
01:24:27.169 --> 01:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
can be said that the offer was retracted
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
because of that so I don't believe that
 
01:24:32.270 --> 01:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
we should be having
 
01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
the Restriction in here for an employer
 
01:24:37.729 --> 01:24:37.739 align:start position:0%
not being able to hire somebody
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
because they have no they're going on
 
01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
good faith they have no experience with
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
this person to be able to say what type
 
01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
of a worker they are how they manage
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
their cannabis card
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
um you know and in respect to you're
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're talking about people don't get a
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis card so that they could overuse
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
and they they can get intoxicated the
 
01:24:57.410 --> 01:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
same could be argued with opioids you
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
know they they go on these they're not
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to be getting intoxicated
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
they're only supposed to be using it to
 
01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
manage their pain that they get addicted
 
01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
and they have overuse and I can see that
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
happening but to restrict an employer
 
01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
from having to pull back a job or
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
continue forward with a job offer that
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
was contingent on passing a drug
 
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
screening I think is this is misplaced
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it has it we we just
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
should not be getting involved in in the
 
01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.090 --> 01:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
I would just like to think I'd just like
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
to ask some questions of
 
01:25:42.239 --> 01:25:42.950 align:start position:0%
to ask some questions of
um

01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.209 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:25:47.209 --> 01:25:47.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sir I don't I don't remember
 
01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
your name the gentleman the blue shirt
 
01:25:51.649 --> 01:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
with the beard
 
01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
distinguished gentleman Mr Holt Michael
 
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
are you are you um okay with this Mr
 
01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:04.790 align:start position:0%
are you are you um okay with this Mr
chairman

01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely sure more information we can
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
so a couple things here and I gotta tell
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
you with legislation and my job I I have
 
01:26:17.689 --> 01:26:17.699 align:start position:0%
not and you know we're not really being
 
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
on this committee
 
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sitting here because I think it's
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
important as a chairman to do so but
 
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
um I I am
 
01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
I read it once and now I'm reading it
 
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
more specifically
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
some of the confusion if I were sitting
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
there behind you listening to this I
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
would think you're comparing a lot of
 
01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
apples and oranges
 
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
am I accurate that you think some of the
 
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
conversation you're hearing is not
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
you don't have to answer that I know
 
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
what you're thinking
 
01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:49.139 align:start position:0%
um sorry I didn't want to probably put
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
you in the spot so because I'm because
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this I'm reading these
 
01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:52.729 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this I'm reading these
things

01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
so there seems to be two issues that I
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
hear Number One releasing someone solely
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
because they have
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
a positive test
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
and hiring someone
 
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
and I look at then the prohibitions and
 
01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
limitations of therapeutic use of
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis 126 X3
 
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
but before we get into this let's just
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
take a real life situation
 
01:27:18.649 --> 01:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
okay because obviously this has happened
 
01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
because the chart you showed me showed
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
there's over 4 000 people employed in
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire someone's
 
01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
provided me I'm not sure who that was me
 
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
okay provided there were approximately
 
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
four thousand people right now employed
 
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:27:34.970 --> 01:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
um and and others who had been employed
 
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
who are no longer employed for any
 
01:27:38.209 --> 01:27:38.219 align:start position:0%
number of probably reasons right they
 
01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
retired or just whatever
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
so we have two different situations okay
 
01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
I have a person who works for me
 
01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
and then they get they get they come
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
down with crohn's disease and that's one
 
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
of the items that's allowable under the
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
therapeutic they come up with crohn's
 
01:27:54.719 --> 01:27:55.970 align:start position:0%
therapeutic they come up with crohn's
disease

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
disease
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
so then they come to me as an already
 
01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.410 align:start position:0%
so then they come to me as an already
employee

01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
and say Hey you know I have Crohn's
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
disease I've been provided with a
 
01:28:07.129 --> 01:28:07.139 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis use
 
01:28:07.139 --> 01:28:09.189 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis use
card

01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
card
 
01:28:12.169 --> 01:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
and I want the ability to
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
to do this to utilize it now x 3 26x3
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
actually allows the individual
 
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.530 align:start position:0%
actually allows the individual
to

01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
it requires them to get written
 
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
permission from the property owner
 
01:28:33.250 --> 01:28:33.260 align:start position:0%
to use their barability therapeutic
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
qualifying patient may use cannabis on
 
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
privately owned property only with the
 
01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
written permission of the property owner
 
01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:45.719 align:start position:0%
so is that one of the written
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
permissions that you you've talked about
 
01:28:53.689 --> 01:28:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:53.699 --> 01:28:54.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
I I have I have copies of this if anyone
 
01:28:59.689 --> 01:28:59.699 align:start position:0%
wants to read along yeah does that would
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
that be helpful he's even reading it off
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman you don't mind if I go
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
through this and kind of my thought
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
process of going through this and trying
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
to understand real life situations
 
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
because I
 
01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:40.010 align:start position:0%
because I
um

01:29:40.010 --> 01:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:42.050 --> 01:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
I want to be able to break down an
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
existing employee and a new employee
 
01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
and then the existing employee or and
 
01:29:50.530 --> 01:29:50.540 align:start position:0%
then the the breakdown the part about
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
not being able to terminate versus not
 
01:29:55.850 --> 01:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
being able to ask when it comes to the
 
01:29:57.649 --> 01:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
hiring position okay so those are the
 
01:29:59.930 --> 01:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
the things I'm looking at
 
01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:01.370 align:start position:0%
the things I'm looking at
so

01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:02.450 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:30:02.450 --> 01:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
in order to utilize it they must have
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
written permission
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
or the property owner
 
01:30:12.110 --> 01:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
or if they're a tenant
 
01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:15.350 align:start position:0%
or if they're a tenant
um

01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
allow qualifications to smoke cannabis
 
01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
on rental property one of the things
 
01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:23.219 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to talk about as we maybe
 
01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
clean things up since we now have a lot
 
01:30:27.290 --> 01:30:27.300 align:start position:0%
of edibles
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
should it be appropriate to add
 
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
something to this to the current law
 
01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:34.669 align:start position:0%
something to this to the current law
about

01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
ingesting Edibles because not everyone
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
gets I mean is therapeutic cannabis only
 
01:30:42.649 --> 01:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
smokable marijuana in the state of New
 
01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:44.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no therapeutic cannabis comes
 
01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
with a variety of routes of
 
01:30:48.970 --> 01:30:48.980 align:start position:0%
administration inhalable
 
01:30:52.689 --> 01:30:52.699 align:start position:0%
products combustion or non-combustion
 
01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
tinctures which are you know oil that's
 
01:30:57.729 --> 01:30:57.739 align:start position:0%
you know that you put in your mouth
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
topicals like solves Edibles beverages
 
01:31:05.209 --> 01:31:05.219 align:start position:0%
Etc so suppositories
 
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
okay didn't know about that okay so just
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head should should you
 
01:31:12.649 --> 01:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
know right now it basically says to
 
01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
allow a qualifying Pages for cannabis on
 
01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
rented property if smoking on the
 
01:31:17.629 --> 01:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
property violates at least is there
 
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
anything that needs to be updated here
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
in your opinion that's going to
 
01:31:23.209 --> 01:31:23.219 align:start position:0%
potentially even if we don't allow
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
anything other than even if we don't
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
agree to any other parts of the current
 
01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.629 align:start position:0%
agree to any other parts of the current
bill

01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
should there be any changes made to
 
01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
include some of these other mechanisms
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
to get permission to I look I look at
 
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
paragraph one differently I look at
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
paragraph one as um
 
01:31:44.330 --> 01:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
if where you live you know um if you're
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
releasing property where you live
 
01:31:47.450 --> 01:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
um you know when we're talking about
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
employ employer employee you know the
 
01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
the important sections are are I I would
 
01:31:56.649 --> 01:31:56.659 align:start position:0%
I would redirect to uh
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
respectfully to paragraph two
 
01:32:02.090 --> 01:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
um paragraph two
 
01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
a two nothing in this chapter she'll
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
exempt any person from arrest or
 
01:32:07.679 --> 01:32:09.950 align:start position:0%
exempt any person from arrest or
prosecution

01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
prosecution
 
01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
for being under the influence of
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis while in his or her place of
 
01:32:17.930 --> 01:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
employment without the written
 
01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
permission of the employer
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay period okay to me that gives the
 
01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:26.830 align:start position:0%
okay period okay to me that gives the
employer

01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:32:29.689 --> 01:32:29.699 align:start position:0%
absolute control
 
01:32:34.129 --> 01:32:34.139 align:start position:0%
or or the ability to determine that an
 
01:32:34.139 --> 01:32:35.510 align:start position:0%
or or the ability to determine that an
employee

01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
cannot be under the influence
 
01:32:42.770 --> 01:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
at the place of employment without the
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
employer's written permission
 
01:32:48.050 --> 01:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
regardless of impairment Under the
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
Influence is not impairment
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a it is arguably a
 
01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
different standard
 
01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:56.750 align:start position:0%
different standard
so

01:32:56.750 --> 01:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
all the all the cases all the all the
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
case studies that I'm hearing from
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
people who have concerns
 
01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:04.729 align:start position:0%
people who have concerns
um

01:33:04.729 --> 01:33:04.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
to me don't
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
they don't I don't hear how the employer
 
01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
is disadvantaged
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
because under the amen of the the
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
solely because there is a positive drug
 
01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:25.850 align:start position:0%
solely because there is a positive drug
test

01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
test
 
01:33:28.850 --> 01:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
there has to be some other Factor
 
01:33:31.669 --> 01:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
you know uh at play and an employer can
 
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
come up with any number of factors like
 
01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
the example that you provided uh last uh
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks ago was
 
01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:39.410 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks ago was
um

01:33:39.410 --> 01:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
my employee got into an accident and
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
then the company's policy is a mandatory
 
01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
drug test
 
01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patient comes back
 
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
positive as you would expect
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
but the positive drug test is not is not
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
the only Factor the factor is he was in
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
an accident
 
01:34:00.169 --> 01:34:00.179 align:start position:0%
so the person gets fired
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
due to being in an accident an
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable vehicle on company time
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
01:34:10.010 --> 01:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
not an issue of the fact that he had a
 
01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
positive drug test it was there's two
 
01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
factors accident and a positive drug
 
01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:16.430 align:start position:0%
factors accident and a positive drug
test

01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
test
 
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
he can be terminated and I'm not a I'm
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
not a labor attorney and I'm not an
 
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
arbitrator and I'm not I'm not familiar
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
with these cases but to me it seems you
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
know it seems fairly straightforward
 
01:34:31.129 --> 01:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
um that there needs to be something else
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
involved and what this this is a modest
 
01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
bill in my opinion that just says that
 
01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
you know in in that case where that
 
01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:40.380 align:start position:0%
where where it can't where a candidate
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
for employment is determined to be the
 
01:34:44.209 --> 01:34:44.219 align:start position:0%
best possible candidate out of all
 
01:34:49.490 --> 01:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
but you have to take a drug test and you
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
come back positive and you're
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
and your therapeutic cannabis patient
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
yeah you've already been determined to
 
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
be the best possible candidate of all
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
the candidates that applied but yes the
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
bill would say you still have to hire
 
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
them but it doesn't mean that the
 
01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
employer needs to give that person
 
01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:11.689 align:start position:0%
employer needs to give that person
permission

01:35:11.689 --> 01:35:11.699 align:start position:0%
permission
 
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
to possess cannabis at the workplace
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
to be under the influence of cannabis at
 
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
the workplace and it certainly doesn't
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
let them be impaired
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't let them Drive doesn't let them
 
01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
operate heavy machinery but that person
 
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
has already been determined to be the
 
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
best possible candidate
 
01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
and when we have a a a a drug test that
 
01:35:36.169 --> 01:35:36.179 align:start position:0%
just yes of course I'm going to fail
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
that THC blood uh blood blood test
 
01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
that should not be the reason why the
 
01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
bill proposes the idea that that should
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
not be the sole Factor
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
for not hiring that person
 
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
once that person is hired the employer
 
01:35:53.159 --> 01:35:54.770 align:start position:0%
once that person is hired the employer
has

01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
any number of options
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
in front of them
 
01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
to limit their use and to fire them if
 
01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:05.149 align:start position:0%
to limit their use and to fire them if
they

01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:36:09.169 --> 01:36:09.179 align:start position:0%
do anything but solely
 
01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
have a positive drug test
 
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
which they always which they will always
 
01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
have a positive drug test
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
there's got to be some other Factor so I
 
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
don't representative infantine I don't
 
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
mean to interrupt but
 
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
um you know so I or or you know go off
 
01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
on on a tangent but you know so I look
 
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:28.860 align:start position:0%
at I look at 2A 2.
 
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
you can't be under the influence
 
01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:32.270 align:start position:0%
you can't be under the influence
um

01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
then you go under uh Roman 2
 
01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:40.129 align:start position:0%
then you go under uh Roman 2

01:36:44.209 --> 01:36:44.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
nothing in this chapter shall exempt a
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
person from a rest or prosecution
 
01:36:52.850 --> 01:36:52.860 align:start position:0%
for the possession of cannabis
 
01:36:55.729 --> 01:36:55.739 align:start position:0%
in a place of employment without the
 
01:36:57.709 --> 01:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
written permission of the employer so
 
01:36:59.570 --> 01:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
you can't use it while you're at work
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
you can't possess it while at work
 
01:37:04.010 --> 01:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
without the permission of the of your
 
01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:05.689 align:start position:0%
without the permission of the of your
employer

01:37:05.689 --> 01:37:05.699 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
and then if you go down to
 
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 C nothing in this chapter shall
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
be construed to require
 
01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
any accommodation of the therapeutic use
 
01:37:20.689 --> 01:37:20.699 align:start position:0%
of cannabis on the property or premises
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
of any place of employment
 
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
along with other places this chapter
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
shall in no way limit an employer's
 
01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
ability to discipline an employee for
 
01:37:33.169 --> 01:37:33.179 align:start position:0%
ingesting cannabis in the workplace or
 
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
for working while under the influence of
 
01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:37.010 align:start position:0%
for working while under the influence of
cannabis

01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
to me this is a very modest Bill and it
 
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:52.159 align:start position:0%
patients on using therapeutic cannabis
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
that that product
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
should be treated like
 
01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:04.010 --> 01:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
there's no other medication
 
01:38:07.729 --> 01:38:07.739 align:start position:0%
that has the same standard
 
01:38:10.990 --> 01:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
as what's already in the law
 
01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
no one is required to disclose their
 
01:38:18.169 --> 01:38:18.179 align:start position:0%
opiate use or their benzodiazepine use
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
or any other medication
 
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
if you're on the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
program you must disclose that if you're
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
doing that if you're if you're engaging
 
01:38:37.209 --> 01:38:37.219 align:start position:0%
in that activity taking your medicine
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
while at work
 
01:38:42.649 --> 01:38:42.659 align:start position:0%
so when when we when we when we think
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
about when we think about these cases
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
these examples that we we started to go
 
01:38:47.450 --> 01:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
down the road on and all the examples
 
01:38:49.610 --> 01:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
that have been that have been imagined
 
01:38:51.169 --> 01:38:51.179 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see this I I don't see anything
 
01:38:58.129 --> 01:38:58.139 align:start position:0%
that would limit an employer's ability
 
01:39:01.129 --> 01:39:01.139 align:start position:0%
to discipline an employee because every
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
other case that you've mentioned has
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
another factor involved
 
01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
all this bill does is say that
 
01:39:11.629 --> 01:39:11.639 align:start position:0%
that pre-screening drug test or that
 
01:39:13.729 --> 01:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
pre-employment drug test if you're a
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patient
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
and they've already been selected as the
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
best candidate possible amongst all the
 
01:39:23.450 --> 01:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
people who've been who've applied
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
you got to hire them because they're the
 
01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:25.910 align:start position:0%
you got to hire them because they're the
best

01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
and they have a medical condition
 
01:39:30.050 --> 01:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
and their doctor has said using
 
01:39:32.209 --> 01:39:32.219 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis is the best way to
 
01:39:37.610 --> 01:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
only representative so I wasn't trying
 
01:39:43.129 --> 01:39:43.139 align:start position:0%
to find testimony no I'm sorry it's good
 
01:39:44.090 --> 01:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
to have this conversation open
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
conversation so you're fine
 
01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.570 align:start position:0%
conversation so you're fine
representative

01:39:47.570 --> 01:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:49.310 --> 01:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I know I'm not
 
01:39:50.570 --> 01:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
part of this committee so I appreciate
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
the Indulgence
 
01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
um using your example Mr Holt with the
 
01:39:58.850 --> 01:39:58.860 align:start position:0%
prospective employer employee does not
 
01:40:00.890 --> 01:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
notify the employer that they are on the
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana plan
 
01:40:04.729 --> 01:40:04.739 align:start position:0%
and the employer says you come back
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
positive we're not going to hire you
 
01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
and now all of a sudden you pull out
 
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
your card is that actionable against the
 
01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:13.129 align:start position:0%
your card is that actionable against the
employer

01:40:13.129 --> 01:40:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:15.649 --> 01:40:15.659 align:start position:0%
if I were a if I were a therapeutic
 
01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient and I was very
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
interested in having that job
 
01:40:23.689 --> 01:40:23.699 align:start position:0%
and this law was this this bill passes
 
01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
in its law
 
01:40:27.050 --> 01:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
it would be in my interest to disclose
 
01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:28.729 align:start position:0%
it would be in my interest to disclose
that

01:40:28.729 --> 01:40:28.739 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
um at
 
01:40:34.250 --> 01:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
at some point around the time when I
 
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
learned that there's a mandatory drug
 
01:40:38.330 --> 01:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
test by the way I will come back
 
01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:39.890 align:start position:0%
test by the way I will come back
positive

01:40:39.890 --> 01:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
positive
 
01:40:42.530 --> 01:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
for THC because I'm a therapeutic
 
01:40:44.689 --> 01:40:44.699 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient
 
01:40:44.699 --> 01:40:45.470 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient
um

01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
is it actionable I mean these are these
 
01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
are legal terms that and I'm not an
 
01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
attorney I I would argue that virtually
 
01:40:56.689 --> 01:40:56.699 align:start position:0%
anything is actionable I mean we were
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know I work for the state I mean any
 
01:41:00.770 --> 01:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
adverse action that the Department of
 
01:41:03.649 --> 01:41:03.659 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services makes to any
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
of our clients is appealable so if your
 
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:41:13.729 --> 01:41:13.739 align:start position:0%
is it everything's actionable
 
01:41:16.610 --> 01:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
people people can people can bring
 
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
lawsuits for for any perceived grievance
 
01:41:22.970 --> 01:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
followers so if this law passes what
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
would be the um
 
01:41:27.169 --> 01:41:27.179 align:start position:0%
employers rights under this he would
 
01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
have no he would have no rights because
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
the employee has that card now he has to
 
01:41:33.530 --> 01:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
hire him even though
 
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
he failed the drug test
 
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
without prior knowledge
 
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
so he would have to hire this employee
 
01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:43.430 align:start position:0%
so he would have to hire this employee
regardless

01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know what other rights employee
 
01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
employers have under other law that
 
01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
might come to bear
 
01:41:53.149 --> 01:41:53.159 align:start position:0%
so I I I can't say that
 
01:41:56.090 --> 01:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
they are required to hire but the the
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
scenario that's been described is of all
 
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
the candidates this candidate is
 
01:42:02.570 --> 01:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
determined to be the best
 
01:42:07.129 --> 01:42:07.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
they fail the drug test and they show a
 
01:42:13.850 --> 01:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
cannabis card under this bill
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
absent my knowledge of any other
 
01:42:19.490 --> 01:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
labor law
 
01:42:22.850 --> 01:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
it is possible that they
 
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
would be subject to a grievance if they
 
01:42:30.290 --> 01:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
chose to not hire the person contrary
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
01:42:34.250 --> 01:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
the problem may have and hopefully you
 
01:42:42.770 --> 01:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
can maybe clarify some stuff for me
 
01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:43.669 align:start position:0%
can maybe clarify some stuff for me
um

01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
I knew this guy once that smoked quite a
 
01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
bit apart
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
and uh when they go to work he was kind
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
of a space shot
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:42:56.090 --> 01:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
um couldn't be trusted to to do uh
 
01:42:59.090 --> 01:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
calculations correctly uh you know a cut
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
a board correctly in a construction site
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
or whatever and uh
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
the the problem I have is if he has a
 
01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:08.390 align:start position:0%
the the problem I have is if he has a
card

01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
card
 
01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
the employer is his hands are tied he
 
01:43:13.129 --> 01:43:13.139 align:start position:0%
can't say uh you know you're a lousy
 
01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
employee but it's but I've got this card
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
um if uh if a construction worker
 
01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:23.340 align:start position:0%
is not able to use it his or her tools
 
01:43:26.330 --> 01:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
properly like a like a like a saw or a
 
01:43:29.810 --> 01:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
tape measure and is cutting pieces of
 
01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
wood improperly
 
01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
then as an employer
 
01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
don't you think you have the right to
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
discipline that employee for poor work
 
01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.790 align:start position:0%
discipline that employee for poor work
performance

01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:45.530 --> 01:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's what that's what I'm
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
worried about here and so and so the
 
01:43:50.209 --> 01:43:50.219 align:start position:0%
card is irrelevant
 
01:43:52.609 --> 01:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
that person can be disciplined or
 
01:43:52.619 --> 01:43:54.109 align:start position:0%
that person can be disciplined or
terminated

01:43:54.109 --> 01:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
terminated
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
based on the poor work performance no
 
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
this employer hasn't as an experience
 
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
with with somebody with a cannabis card
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
and somebody else comes along
 
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
and they want to be hired for this job
 
01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
and they've got all the qualifications
 
01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
but he's got this bad taste in his mouth
 
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
maybe not only one but two or three or
 
01:44:17.689 --> 01:44:17.699 align:start position:0%
four other employees and to take that
 
01:44:19.609 --> 01:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
that right to say
 
01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not going down that road again
 
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
um is uh
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
I I can't we've got to take that out as
 
01:44:31.129 --> 01:44:31.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
the employer as a as a hiring manager
 
01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:35.450 align:start position:0%
the employer as a as a hiring manager
myself

01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
who deals with you know
 
01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
many resumes for every position that I
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
hire for
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
it it seems it it doesn't seem like a
 
01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:48.890 align:start position:0%
it it seems it it doesn't seem like a
realistic

01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
realistic
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
um shackle
 
01:44:54.129 --> 01:44:54.139 align:start position:0%
um to not be able to find another reason
 
01:44:58.430 --> 01:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
not to hire an individual
 
01:45:00.649 --> 01:45:00.659 align:start position:0%
there's there's always someone who is
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
better at something
 
01:45:06.109 --> 01:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm trying to say is uh you
 
01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
know a a small home improvement company
 
01:45:12.290 --> 01:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
and in the end a lot of times I hired
 
01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
people on gut instinct
 
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
do you do a mandatory drug test
 
01:45:19.850 --> 01:45:19.860 align:start position:0%
at times I did
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
you know depending on the position so
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes sometimes you did and
 
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes you didn't yeah okay
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
um depending on the position
 
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
but would have boiled down to a lot of
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
times was gut instinct and I don't want
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
to take that away from an employer to
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to say no there's something
 
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
that just doesn't fit here how does this
 
01:45:42.050 --> 01:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
bill take away an employer's ability to
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
hire based on gut instinct
 
01:45:49.129 --> 01:45:49.139 align:start position:0%
well his gut instinct on pass on past uh
 
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
past experience with others
 
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
um you know I did this uh
 
01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
that's a that that was part of the
 
01:45:59.689 --> 01:45:59.699 align:start position:0%
hiring process with me that gut instinct
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
you know and it was it was based on past
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
the business I mean this but exact this
 
01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
bill does not talk about this bill
 
01:46:08.209 --> 01:46:08.219 align:start position:0%
doesn't address gut instincts this bill
 
01:46:11.149 --> 01:46:11.159 align:start position:0%
says that if you
 
01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
this bill says that just because you
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
have a card mm-hmm
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
you can't be
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
denied employment or terminated and it
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
says just because you have a
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
positive test for THC you can't be
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
denied employment or terminated it
 
01:46:30.169 --> 01:46:30.179 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that any other reason you
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
can be terminated or not hired for
 
01:46:35.209 --> 01:46:35.219 align:start position:0%
and what it does say is just because an
 
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
employer has had a bad bad experience
 
01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
with somebody
 
01:46:41.810 --> 01:46:41.820 align:start position:0%
um or somebody else that uh you know
 
01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe has a cannabis cotton they
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
smoke a few bones before they come to
 
01:46:47.649 --> 01:46:47.659 align:start position:0%
work and you can't prove it
 
01:46:52.129 --> 01:46:52.139 align:start position:0%
you know I'd be real hesitant myself
 
01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
okay and I don't want that red that that
 
01:46:57.649 --> 01:46:57.659 align:start position:0%
right taken away okay as an employer I
 
01:46:58.970 --> 01:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
think you I I don't think this bill
 
01:47:01.250 --> 01:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
takes away and of course employers
 
01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
rights in that regard because there are
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
other reasons why someone can be not not
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
hired or uh can be terminated um poor
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
work performance
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
um I mean if you if you smoke a bone
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
before work your clothes will smell of
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:21.530 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:47:21.530 --> 01:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
you're not if you don't have your
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
employer's written permission to possess
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis at the workplace if you smell
 
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
like cannabis it sounds to me like you
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
had the the the law says they you can be
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
arrested for that
 
01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
not just not hired the law establishes
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
that you can be arrested if you show up
 
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
on a work at a workplace with cannabis
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
in your pocket or being under the
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
influence of it yeah I could see
 
01:47:52.490 --> 01:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
somebody using Febreze on their clothes
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
represent them from
 
01:47:56.810 --> 01:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
um all right so
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna move away a little bit from
 
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
that conversation
 
01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:02.090 align:start position:0%
that conversation
um

01:48:02.090 --> 01:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:04.189 --> 01:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
and what I'd like to know is in the
 
01:48:06.109 --> 01:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
amendment it says that the section shall
 
01:48:07.970 --> 01:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
not apply in cases where this limitation
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the employer's
 
01:48:11.390 --> 01:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
obligations under federal law or
 
01:48:13.010 --> 01:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
regulations or to fulfill a federal
 
01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
contract or licensing obligations it's
 
01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
lines 13 and 14 on the amendment
 
01:48:21.850 --> 01:48:21.860 align:start position:0%
um do we have a list of what those
 
01:48:25.490 --> 01:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
positions are or employers are that
 
01:48:28.490 --> 01:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
would qualify under that and giving this
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
licensing obligation piece with the
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
changes that the governor is proposing
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
in our state licensure
 
01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
um how is that going to be affected I
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
guess I would like to learn a little bit
 
01:48:40.490 --> 01:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
more about that
 
01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:42.659 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:48:45.530 --> 01:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
my other comment on this is to move away
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit from the hiring practice
 
01:48:50.209 --> 01:48:50.219 align:start position:0%
I understand the what what
 
01:48:52.669 --> 01:48:52.679 align:start position:0%
representative was saying again about
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
the votes on the house floor and what
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
the likely votes may be on this as well
 
01:49:01.970 --> 01:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
um I would feel
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
a little bit more comfortable if we
 
01:49:05.810 --> 01:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
removed the part about denying
 
01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:07.729 align:start position:0%
removed the part about denying
employment

01:49:07.729 --> 01:49:07.739 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
um you know I guess that would be an
 
01:49:12.530 --> 01:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
area that I could be
 
01:49:14.229 --> 01:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
flexible on
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
the other part of it I'm hearing what's
 
01:49:21.050 --> 01:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
being said as far as soleon although you
 
01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
know I would argue the the argument of
 
01:49:26.209 --> 01:49:26.219 align:start position:0%
the accident if somebody had an accident
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
and they tested positive for cannabis
 
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
use and somebody had an accident who
 
01:49:32.810 --> 01:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
didn't test positive for cannabis use
 
01:49:35.930 --> 01:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
and that person was not terminated but
 
01:49:37.729 --> 01:49:37.739 align:start position:0%
the one who was tested positive for
 
01:49:39.770 --> 01:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
cannabis use I think they would have a
 
01:49:41.090 --> 01:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
hard time explaining that they
 
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
terminated them because they had an
 
01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:44.470 align:start position:0%
terminated them because they had an
accident

01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
accident
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
and again I'm sensitive to the fact that
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
our law enforcement
 
01:49:52.689 --> 01:49:52.699 align:start position:0%
cannot test for the level of intoxic
 
01:49:55.609 --> 01:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
intoxication on cannabis use so when an
 
01:49:58.129 --> 01:49:58.139 align:start position:0%
accident happens it becomes a he said
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
she said because there's no test that
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
can provide them with information such
 
01:50:06.109 --> 01:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
as what they have with um alcohol
 
01:50:06.119 --> 01:50:08.270 align:start position:0%
as what they have with um alcohol
so

01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:11.450 --> 01:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
I would like to see a list if I could on
 
01:50:14.090 --> 01:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
the limitations that they're saying here
 
01:50:15.649 --> 01:50:15.659 align:start position:0%
under the obligations of federal law
 
01:50:17.450 --> 01:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
regulations in the federal Contracting
 
01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:18.890 align:start position:0%
regulations in the federal Contracting
licensing

01:50:18.890 --> 01:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
01:50:21.970 --> 01:50:21.980 align:start position:0%
and I would like to talk further about
 
01:50:28.850 --> 01:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that um the a
 
01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
document was shared that was created by
 
01:50:35.810 --> 01:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
the marijuana policy project which has a
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh a listing of every State's position
 
01:50:44.090 --> 01:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
on uh therapeutic on medical marijuana
 
01:50:45.649 --> 01:50:45.659 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and their and their
 
01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
projections and or protections and
 
01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:49.490 align:start position:0%
projections and or protections and
restrictions

01:50:49.490 --> 01:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
01:50:53.450 --> 01:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
um in that document there are uh
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
I I have not digested and internalized
 
01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
all 50 states
 
01:50:59.930 --> 01:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
um policies
 
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
um and so I can't give you that list but
 
01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
I believe the the that document is
 
01:51:06.890 --> 01:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
certainly a good starting place
 
01:51:08.810 --> 01:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
um I did a quick Google search before I
 
01:51:10.729 --> 01:51:10.739 align:start position:0%
came here and there's the there's a
 
01:51:13.250 --> 01:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
federal Omnibus Transportation Act
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
um that identifies uh some
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
um ACLU has documentation on on uh
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
testing standards in different states
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
um there's a law passed in the 80s uh
 
01:51:25.250 --> 01:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
that prohibit illiter drug use of
 
01:51:27.169 --> 01:51:27.179 align:start position:0%
federal employees you know it's on the
 
01:51:28.850 --> 01:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
books there's there's plenty of
 
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
information out there you know
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
um that that has that has those has has
 
01:51:38.450 --> 01:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
an explanation of the language that is
 
01:51:40.729 --> 01:51:40.739 align:start position:0%
in the amendment the the language and
 
01:51:45.649 --> 01:51:45.659 align:start position:0%
the amendment is is a catch-all that
 
01:51:47.930 --> 01:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
that all of those other documents
 
01:51:50.209 --> 01:51:50.219 align:start position:0%
federal law can be hung upon without
 
01:51:53.890 --> 01:51:53.900 align:start position:0%
listing each single uh
 
01:51:56.689 --> 01:51:56.699 align:start position:0%
employment category
 
01:51:58.729 --> 01:51:58.739 align:start position:0%
um but I I am not prepared to give you a
 
01:52:01.250 --> 01:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
list of everything that falls under that
 
01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
because I simply don't know
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
um and absent any absent you know any
 
01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:08.810 align:start position:0%
um and absent any absent you know any
any

01:52:08.810 --> 01:52:08.820 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely absent like a a a
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
commitment to like this if we come up
 
01:52:16.729 --> 01:52:16.739 align:start position:0%
with a list this will be palatable to
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
move forward I mean it's it's hard to
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
dedicate that time of time as someone
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
who's as a department employee where the
 
01:52:24.770 --> 01:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
department doesn't have a position on
 
01:52:26.209 --> 01:52:26.219 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm sorry I think you
 
01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
misunderstood I wasn't necessarily
 
01:52:29.629 --> 01:52:29.639 align:start position:0%
asking it from you I was asking it more
 
01:52:31.550 --> 01:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
from our study so if it has to go to our
 
01:52:33.050 --> 01:52:33.060 align:start position:0%
research and if that does end up with
 
01:52:35.209 --> 01:52:35.219 align:start position:0%
you then I understand what you're saying
 
01:52:38.209 --> 01:52:38.219 align:start position:0%
so I apologize for that um if but the
 
01:52:40.250 --> 01:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
email you spoke of that just came in two
 
01:52:42.050 --> 01:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
minutes before we started so I have not
 
01:52:44.209 --> 01:52:44.219 align:start position:0%
had a chance to go through all of the
 
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
states to read all of that data so that
 
01:52:48.890 --> 01:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
that came in um before this meeting so
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
we need some time I think to read that
 
01:52:52.970 --> 01:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
email and digest the information in
 
01:52:55.850 --> 01:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
there can an employer not hire someone
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
if the mandatory drug tests you know
 
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
pre-employment drugs test comes back is
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
positive for opiates
 
01:53:06.169 --> 01:53:06.179 align:start position:0%
and those opiates are being prescribed
 
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
by a doctor can can somebody can can an
 
01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:11.270 align:start position:0%
by a doctor can can somebody can can an
employer

01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
not hire that person because they are
 
01:53:15.649 --> 01:53:15.659 align:start position:0%
prescribed an opiate and they test
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
positive for opiates
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
to my understanding and the decisions
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
that were made in the business that I
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
was in was yes they could choose not to
 
01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:27.060 align:start position:0%
hire for that they could have the
 
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
conversation they could find out what's
 
01:53:31.129 --> 01:53:31.139 align:start position:0%
going on we were in HVAC company so
 
01:53:34.010 --> 01:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of roof work crane work
 
01:53:37.250 --> 01:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
um high risk work electrical work so not
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
to mention the amount of vehicles that
 
01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
we operated so um they may have made
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.250 --> 01:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman I'm just
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
curious if somebody has an answer to
 
01:53:58.970 --> 01:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
this question I know there's we talk
 
01:54:00.590 --> 01:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
about the impairment and if there's an
 
01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:01.490 align:start position:0%
about the impairment and if there's an
accident

01:54:01.490 --> 01:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
accident
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
somebody gets tested for cannabis use
 
01:54:06.050 --> 01:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
most times it's going to be a urine test
 
01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
if somebody's involved in an accident
 
01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:11.990 align:start position:0%
if somebody's involved in an accident
um

01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
police departments
 
01:54:16.490 --> 01:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
allowed to test
 
01:54:19.070 --> 01:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
for take a blood sample
 
01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:20.570 align:start position:0%
for take a blood sample
and

01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:23.629 --> 01:54:23.639 align:start position:0%
and if they can test blood sample
 
01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
can cannabis be picked up the amount of
 
01:54:27.530 --> 01:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
cannabis that's in somebody's system be
 
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
picked up in a blood test do you do you
 
01:54:32.209 --> 01:54:32.219 align:start position:0%
know if that
 
01:54:35.149 --> 01:54:35.159 align:start position:0%
happens if it's
 
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
the the level of cannabis the level of
 
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.310 align:start position:0%
the the level of cannabis the level of
THC

01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
THC
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
is detectable
 
01:54:45.530 --> 01:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
in a person's body through a blood test
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
so if somebody's involved in an accident
 
01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
causing Serious injury
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
most likely
 
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say most likely it it's
 
01:54:57.649 --> 01:54:57.659 align:start position:0%
possible that a blood test could be done
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
to see how much THC is in that system
 
01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
absolutely that as we know the difficult
 
01:55:07.070 --> 01:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
part with that is that
 
01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
the level of THC in someone's blood is
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
not necessarily indicative of impairment
 
01:55:21.410 --> 01:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
like a level of alcohol in the blood is
 
01:55:25.609 --> 01:55:25.619 align:start position:0%
and so we have chronic users who are
 
01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
using every night
 
01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
every day
 
01:55:33.169 --> 01:55:33.179 align:start position:0%
never doing it during the day they will
 
01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
not be impaired but their blood will
 
01:55:37.729 --> 01:55:37.739 align:start position:0%
come back with a very high level
 
01:55:40.970 --> 01:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
some states have chosen to establish an
 
01:55:45.050 --> 01:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
arbitrary level of THC in the blood as
 
01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
something over which
 
01:55:51.470 --> 01:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
you'll be deemed impaired regardless of
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
your actual impairment some states have
 
01:55:54.890 --> 01:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
done this
 
01:55:58.129 --> 01:55:58.139 align:start position:0%
it's and some states have done this and
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
then you know been sued uh successfully
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
and and those laws have determined to be
 
01:56:09.410 --> 01:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.410 --> 01:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
someone that's going to consume a five
 
01:56:14.689 --> 01:56:14.699 align:start position:0%
milligram gummy at nine o'clock at night
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
will not be impaired when they go to
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
work the next morning that's correct
 
01:56:21.169 --> 01:56:21.179 align:start position:0%
versus that person that may as
 
01:56:23.330 --> 01:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
representative love said smokes a bone
 
01:56:26.570 --> 01:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
if they smoke the entire joint that
 
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
could be anywhere from
 
01:56:34.010 --> 01:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
let's say 20 THC to 26 possibly even 30
 
01:56:36.229 --> 01:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
percent THC
 
01:56:39.169 --> 01:56:39.179 align:start position:0%
um at nine o'clock at night they consume
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
that entire
 
01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:42.770 align:start position:0%
that entire
joint

01:56:42.770 --> 01:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
joint
 
01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:43.669 align:start position:0%
joint
um

01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
they're still most likely not going to
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
be impaired the next morning eight hours
 
01:56:50.209 --> 01:56:50.219 align:start position:0%
later they will not be in they'll have a
 
01:56:52.370 --> 01:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
positive test based upon the fact that
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
it stays in it's going to stay in your
 
01:56:58.189 --> 01:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
system a lot longer in both those cases
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
and I think that's part of the what I'm
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
hearing here is you know we're worried
 
01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
about the impairment again I truly
 
01:57:07.850 --> 01:57:07.860 align:start position:0%
believe that the people that are on the
 
01:57:09.169 --> 01:57:09.179 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis that are looking
 
01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
for employment are not going to be your
 
01:57:13.550 --> 01:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
people that are really going out
 
01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
um and going to
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
smoke that
 
01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:19.790 align:start position:0%
smoke that
marijuana

01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
01:57:23.450 --> 01:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
um that has 26 THC and expect somebody
 
01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
at work not to notice that I don't see
 
01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
that as being a problem
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
um right they might take 2.5 milligrams
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
of a tincture in the morning before work
 
01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
not bring it hopefully it lasts all day
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know and not be impaired at all not
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
feel impairment you know uh under the
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
law would they be under the influence
 
01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
probably and when we say and just
 
01:57:52.609 --> 01:57:52.619 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong here under the
 
01:57:54.890 --> 01:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
influence doesn't necessarily is it
 
01:57:56.209 --> 01:57:56.219 align:start position:0%
there are difference between under the
 
01:57:57.890 --> 01:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
influence and impairment because if
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
you're impaired you obviously have a
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
high level sort of like alcohol correct
 
01:58:04.430 --> 01:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
I mean they're saying what is it point
 
01:58:06.770 --> 01:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
zero eight is you can I mean you can you
 
01:58:08.689 --> 01:58:08.699 align:start position:0%
can be arrested for being intoxicated
 
01:58:10.609 --> 01:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
even if your blood comes back at under
 
01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
0.08 I mean if you if you just if you
 
01:58:14.570 --> 01:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
display other
 
01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
um other other signs of impairment you
 
01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
know you don't you know you're still you
 
01:58:22.370 --> 01:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
know you can be arrested detained and
 
01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for you know Reckless
 
01:58:26.089 --> 01:58:26.099 align:start position:0%
Behavior even though you're coming back
 
01:58:29.450 --> 01:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
under 0.08 yeah and and I my whole
 
01:58:31.970 --> 01:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
concern here is that you know I don't
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
want to push this off because I truly
 
01:58:36.410 --> 01:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
I truly believe in a therapeutic
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis program
 
01:58:39.119 --> 01:58:40.189 align:start position:0%
cannabis program
um

01:58:40.189 --> 01:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:42.530 --> 01:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
I think people that have been around for
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
a while understand where we've gone with
 
01:58:47.450 --> 01:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
opioids I think everybody understands
 
01:58:49.370 --> 01:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
the you know the problems we've had with
 
01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:50.030 align:start position:0%
the you know the problems we've had with
it

01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:58:52.430 --> 01:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
um and you know I think therapeutic
 
01:58:54.530 --> 01:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
cannabis program has really helped I
 
01:58:57.050 --> 01:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
know several people that do it
 
01:58:58.729 --> 01:58:58.739 align:start position:0%
um and it's helped them as
 
01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative infantig said so
 
01:59:04.729 --> 01:59:04.739 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned that we're
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
I might I want to move something forward
 
01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.719 align:start position:0%
I want us to get off the fixation of
 
01:59:11.810 --> 01:59:11.820 align:start position:0%
um this impairment thing because again I
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
truly believe that people that are using
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
at night
 
01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
um it's not going to be bothersome to
 
01:59:19.250 --> 01:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
the employers
 
01:59:22.370 --> 01:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
um the next day now again
 
01:59:25.250 --> 01:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
I think we all agree that
 
01:59:28.669 --> 01:59:28.679 align:start position:0%
somebody that shows up and may have
 
01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
taken a 10 milligram you know at work I
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
there are signs that people are going to
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
be aware of that somebody that's under
 
01:59:39.770 --> 01:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
the impairment of marijuana I mean
 
01:59:41.810 --> 01:59:41.820 align:start position:0%
I believe that there's
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh police officers are trained to you
 
01:59:44.159 --> 01:59:45.050 align:start position:0%
uh police officers are trained to you
know

01:59:45.050 --> 01:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
um they can pull you know they can see
 
01:59:49.070 --> 01:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
that drugs recognition experts yeah okay
 
01:59:52.970 --> 01:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
so and that's all I'm saying I I want to
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
move something forward I I like it
 
01:59:57.410 --> 01:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
um I think it's something that's needed
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
I understand the concerns but I think we
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
really have to try to get away from the
 
02:00:03.290 --> 02:00:03.300 align:start position:0%
fixation on this impairment part of it
 
02:00:05.570 --> 02:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
because I don't again I'm going to give
 
02:00:07.010 --> 02:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
those people that have therapeutic
 
02:00:08.450 --> 02:00:08.460 align:start position:0%
cannabis Cottage the benefit of the
 
02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
doubt that they are not trying to do it
 
02:00:12.770 --> 02:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
so that they can abuse it at work I'm
 
02:00:14.089 --> 02:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
giving them the benefit of the doubt
 
02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
that they really want this to help their
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
medical condition
 
02:00:19.089 --> 02:00:19.099 align:start position:0%
um they do it at night
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
not everybody's going to do that I
 
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
understand that we're not you know and
 
02:00:25.310 --> 02:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
we can't Safeguard everybody but I truly
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
believe that the majority of these
 
02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
people look at it as something that you
 
02:00:30.530 --> 02:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
know was helping them
 
02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's something that we
 
02:00:34.850 --> 02:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
should move forward so with that Mr
 
02:00:38.330 --> 02:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for indulging me
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um one thing I
 
02:00:43.729 --> 02:00:43.739 align:start position:0%
would like to bring up when we were
 
02:00:45.649 --> 02:00:45.659 align:start position:0%
when the debates were going on was last
 
02:00:49.070 --> 02:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
week for the the uh legalizing marijuana
 
02:00:51.709 --> 02:00:51.719 align:start position:0%
I believe was representative Roy
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh testified about the law enforcement
 
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
in his committee how they said there is
 
02:01:00.770 --> 02:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
no way of telling whether the you know
 
02:01:03.169 --> 02:01:03.179 align:start position:0%
spoke to Joint last night or that the
 
02:01:04.669 --> 02:01:04.679 align:start position:0%
higher than the Georgia Pine right now
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
uh there's no
 
02:01:09.950 --> 02:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
no uh therapeutic not therapy I would
 
02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
say no uh no no medical proof that uh so
 
02:01:16.970 --> 02:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
you know we've got a problem there uh
 
02:01:19.370 --> 02:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
that if
 
02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
if somehow they ever came up with a test
 
02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
that works it'd be uh the answer to all
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
now and I'll just say to and it's I
 
02:01:29.330 --> 02:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
think we have to trust people that's I
 
02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
mean it's you know when something like
 
02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
this is in place
 
02:01:34.189 --> 02:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
um I think it's in place I think that
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
programs in place for a reason
 
02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
um and again I'll keep reiterating I
 
02:01:41.089 --> 02:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
truly don't believe that
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm not speaking for everybody but I
 
02:01:46.189 --> 02:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
truly believe that the majority of these
 
02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
people are not abusing um
 
02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
and I understand like we've talked about
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
this we can say it a thousand times and
 
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely they're going to pass
 
02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
they're going to fail a drug test
 
02:01:58.729 --> 02:01:58.739 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt about it but it doesn't
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
mean they're abusing
 
02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
um the program
 
02:02:05.209 --> 02:02:05.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:07.790 --> 02:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
if I might I just I might just remind
 
02:02:09.250 --> 02:02:09.260 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:02:11.089 --> 02:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that their New Hampshire
 
02:02:12.530 --> 02:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
does have case law
 
02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
um that information was shared with all
 
02:02:15.229 --> 02:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
of you as well
 
02:02:19.250 --> 02:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
um that establishes or uh uh establishes
 
02:02:21.770 --> 02:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
a requirement on the part of an employer
 
02:02:23.209 --> 02:02:23.219 align:start position:0%
um to
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
consider an accommodation under the AGA
 
02:02:30.050 --> 02:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
um that cannabis in a state where it's
 
02:02:33.890 --> 02:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
legal is a legitimate therapy and an
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
employer must accommodate or at least
 
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
consider an accommodation where
 
02:02:40.010 --> 02:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate so we are we already have
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
case law you know that protects people
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
the point of this bill is to allow
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
individuals who are on the program to
 
02:02:54.109 --> 02:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
not have to sue their employer at Great
 
02:02:57.229 --> 02:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
or potential employer at Great cost to
 
02:02:57.239 --> 02:02:58.189 align:start position:0%
or potential employer at Great cost to
them

02:02:58.189 --> 02:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:03:00.410 --> 02:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
for the protection that the courts have
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
already given them
 
02:03:05.089 --> 02:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
and to force their employers to to to
 
02:03:07.850 --> 02:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
take this to take this seriously that
 
02:03:11.089 --> 02:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
this is it is legal in the state
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
it's a medication
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
authorized by a medical provider
 
02:03:19.729 --> 02:03:19.739 align:start position:0%
like any other medication
 
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
case law says employers have to consider
 
02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:23.030 align:start position:0%
case law says employers have to consider
that

02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
but the only recourse for patients
 
02:03:31.970 --> 02:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:36.239 --> 02:03:41.390 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
senator valgolini
 
02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chairman
 
02:03:48.410 --> 02:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
because I think you're using
 
02:03:52.010 --> 02:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
interchangeably with the
 
02:03:54.530 --> 02:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
cannabis program and prescribed
 
02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:58.250 align:start position:0%
cannabis program and prescribed
medications

02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis as
 
02:04:09.410 --> 02:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
a medication or as a therapy
 
02:04:11.570 --> 02:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis law does not
 
02:04:14.629 --> 02:04:14.639 align:start position:0%
use the it is it is intentionally not
 
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana
 
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
there is no prescription like for other
 
02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:23.450 align:start position:0%
there is no prescription like for other
medications

02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
medications
 
02:04:25.550 --> 02:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
and the reason for these
 
02:04:27.290 --> 02:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
policy choices that the New Hampshire
 
02:04:29.089 --> 02:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
legislature made is because it's
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
federally illegal
 
02:04:33.169 --> 02:04:33.179 align:start position:0%
and a schedule 1 substance cannot be
 
02:04:33.179 --> 02:04:34.550 align:start position:0%
and a schedule 1 substance cannot be
prescribed

02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
prescribed
 
02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:36.770 align:start position:0%
prescribed
however

02:04:36.770 --> 02:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:04:38.109 --> 02:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:04:41.930 --> 02:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
used like a medication
 
02:04:44.930 --> 02:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
the point of this of this law is to
 
02:04:49.010 --> 02:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
relieve symptoms of certain medical
 
02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:50.570 align:start position:0%
relieve symptoms of certain medical
conditions

02:04:50.570 --> 02:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
02:04:52.669 --> 02:04:52.679 align:start position:0%
that that you've been that a patient has
 
02:04:54.169 --> 02:04:54.179 align:start position:0%
been diagnosed with
 
02:04:54.179 --> 02:04:56.570 align:start position:0%
been diagnosed with
so

02:04:56.570 --> 02:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:00.530 --> 02:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
what we say in the in the department
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
when we talk about this program to
 
02:05:07.129 --> 02:05:07.139 align:start position:0%
people we call this an alternative
 
02:05:07.139 --> 02:05:08.350 align:start position:0%
people we call this an alternative
therapy

02:05:08.350 --> 02:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
02:05:11.810 --> 02:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
this is therapeutic cannabis it's not a
 
02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:13.129 align:start position:0%
this is therapeutic cannabis it's not a
prescription

02:05:13.129 --> 02:05:13.139 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's not a medication because it cannot
 
02:05:20.330 --> 02:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:24.770 --> 02:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
um I pointed out a provision of law I
 
02:05:30.050 --> 02:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
think at the last session uh that said
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
that the use of therapeutic cannabis
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
um with regard to Medical Care shall be
 
02:05:38.270 --> 02:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
considered the equivalent of a
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
prescribed medication
 
02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:42.709 align:start position:0%
prescribed medication
um

02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:46.330 --> 02:05:46.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
126x colon 2 Roman 7.
 
02:05:53.870 --> 02:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
qualifying patients authorized use of
 
02:05:55.250 --> 02:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
cannabis in accordance with this chapter
 
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
shall be considered to be the equivalent
 
02:05:59.810 --> 02:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
of the authorized use of any other
 
02:06:01.970 --> 02:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
medication used at the direction of a
 
02:06:05.149 --> 02:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
provider and shall not constitute use of
 
02:06:07.550 --> 02:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
an illicit substance
 
02:06:09.709 --> 02:06:09.719 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna I'm not going to Define
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
what a medication is if if that is
 
02:06:15.890 --> 02:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
defined in law so be it
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
I think my answer talks about you know
 
02:06:27.370 --> 02:06:27.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:29.209 --> 02:06:29.219 align:start position:0%
from what I'm hearing in the interview
 
02:06:31.129 --> 02:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
and the discussion has been I don't
 
02:06:32.330 --> 02:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
think there's a question about the
 
02:06:33.649 --> 02:06:33.659 align:start position:0%
program I think it's a question about
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
how to dovetail this into labor law
 
02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:39.189 align:start position:0%
how to dovetail this into labor law
and

02:06:39.189 --> 02:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes we ask a lot of questions to
 
02:06:43.070 --> 02:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have the right answers
 
02:06:45.709 --> 02:06:45.719 align:start position:0%
when regular people read this and say
 
02:06:47.330 --> 02:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
how come I can't do this or why are you
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not allowing us to do this we want
 
02:06:50.930 --> 02:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
to be able to have those answers and or
 
02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
make this clear enough that there's no
 
02:06:56.689 --> 02:06:56.699 align:start position:0%
ambiguity ambiguity and ambiguous
 
02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
language that the department would now
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
have to clarify
 
02:07:03.229 --> 02:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
um based upon what this law says the
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor Department of Labor
 
02:07:07.070 --> 02:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
um well I mean the Department of Labor I
 
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
mean every executive agency has rule
 
02:07:10.930 --> 02:07:10.940 align:start position:0%
making Authority with regard to
 
02:07:12.970 --> 02:07:12.980 align:start position:0%
interpreting and making more clear
 
02:07:15.410 --> 02:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
statutes that is correct I just want to
 
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're on the same
 
02:07:18.470 --> 02:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
direction because they might interpret
 
02:07:20.209 --> 02:07:20.219 align:start position:0%
it a completely different way or an
 
02:07:22.010 --> 02:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
employment attorney May interpret it a
 
02:07:23.629 --> 02:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
completely different way which adds
 
02:07:25.370 --> 02:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
additional costs to the employer should
 
02:07:27.649 --> 02:07:27.659 align:start position:0%
they be sued under this law
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to I'm sorry yeah I I
 
02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
understand the only point the point that
 
02:07:34.669 --> 02:07:34.679 align:start position:0%
I was trying to make as the last point
 
02:07:36.830 --> 02:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
that I was you know trying to remind the
 
02:07:38.689 --> 02:07:38.699 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of is that there is case
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
law that that that does something
 
02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:42.109 align:start position:0%
law that that that does something
similar

02:07:42.109 --> 02:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
similar
 
02:07:45.470 --> 02:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
um but patients don't have access to
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
don't have access to that remedy if they
 
02:07:50.930 --> 02:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
don't have any money
 
02:07:53.810 --> 02:07:53.820 align:start position:0%
and if they don't have a job they
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
certainly don't have money to pay for an
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
attorney to protect them from you know
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
02:08:02.089 --> 02:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
from actions
 
02:08:05.450 --> 02:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
um that are already codified in case law
 
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
you know that's all so there's there's
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
cost on both you know there's cost on
 
02:08:10.729 --> 02:08:10.739 align:start position:0%
both on both uh
 
02:08:10.739 --> 02:08:12.649 align:start position:0%
both on both uh
uh

02:08:12.649 --> 02:08:12.659 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:08:12.659 --> 02:08:14.870 align:start position:0%
uh
sides

02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
sides
 
02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
um I I shared with representative
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
infantine I don't know if he shared it
 
02:08:19.970 --> 02:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
with you but you know just a question
 
02:08:21.530 --> 02:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
was asked last time but like how many
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
people are we talking about I don't know
 
02:08:25.609 --> 02:08:25.619 align:start position:0%
if he shared that information with you
 
02:08:27.050 --> 02:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:08:29.390 --> 02:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
um we do have a voluntary survey
 
02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
question you know are you basically are
 
02:08:34.669 --> 02:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
you employed there are 3 300
 
02:08:37.070 --> 02:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
people out of the 14 000 that have said
 
02:08:38.810 --> 02:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
that they're currently employee of the
 
02:08:41.689 --> 02:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
part-time you know 43 but only about
 
02:08:44.770 --> 02:08:44.780 align:start position:0%
half of the people answered the question
 
02:08:49.850 --> 02:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
58 of respondents right 58 of the
 
02:08:51.649 --> 02:08:51.659 align:start position:0%
population answer the question right so
 
02:08:53.930 --> 02:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
basically there's there's a whole chunk
 
02:08:55.729 --> 02:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
of people who we don't know if we apply
 
02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
the 43 who did or the 43 of the 58 who
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
answered 43 said they did if we just
 
02:09:06.050 --> 02:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
apply that 43 to the total amount we've
 
02:09:09.229 --> 02:09:09.239 align:start position:0%

protection to those who are employed
against

02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
against
 
02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:20.629 align:start position:0%
against
um

02:10:20.629 --> 02:10:20.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:23.450 --> 02:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
discipline or termination
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
um and uh and frankly I think depending
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
on how a legal opinion might work out
 
02:10:32.330 --> 02:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
the people who weren't hired might still
 
02:10:34.209 --> 02:10:34.219 align:start position:0%
have a recourse in court
 
02:10:38.689 --> 02:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
but basically if
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
if making that adjustment would uh
 
02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
satisfy the subcommittee I would be
 
02:10:47.470 --> 02:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
willing to make the adjustment
 
02:10:50.689 --> 02:10:50.699 align:start position:0%
and then based on that make a ought to
 
02:10:52.189 --> 02:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
pass recommendation back to the
 
02:10:55.129 --> 02:10:55.139 align:start position:0%
committee what do we think
 
02:10:57.050 --> 02:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
I think that's a start
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
um the the cave outs for different
 
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
occupations would certainly have to be
 
02:11:04.609 --> 02:11:04.619 align:start position:0%
in it and then we can start talking for
 
02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
not to pass some
 
02:11:10.070 --> 02:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's a carve out already based on the
 
02:11:16.129 --> 02:11:16.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:20.089 --> 02:11:20.099 align:start position:0%
if if I might I I would I would I would
 
02:11:21.649 --> 02:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
recommend that you speak with an
 
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
attorney about that uh that position
 
02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.669 align:start position:0%
attorney about that uh that position
because

02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:11:29.930 --> 02:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
um my non-attorney belief is that
 
02:11:34.370 --> 02:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
that may reduce the protections already
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
afforded through case law what would
 
02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
Reduce by by remu by removing what
 
02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting to remove and that is
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
the the protection from you know denial
 
02:11:46.970 --> 02:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
of employment based solely on a a test
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
that that may that may REM
 
02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
that may remove or lessen the
 
02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
protections that have already been
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
established you know under case law
 
02:11:58.609 --> 02:11:58.619 align:start position:0%
because that was the case this person
 
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
was denied the case person was denied
 
02:12:05.209 --> 02:12:05.219 align:start position:0%
employment based on you know a test
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
um so I would just caution I would call
 
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
I would just caution that you know
 
02:12:12.589 --> 02:12:12.599 align:start position:0%
uh that that that that that effort May
 
02:12:15.709 --> 02:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
reduce current uh rights that patients
 
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
have under the the case law
 
02:12:21.770 --> 02:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
a lawyer may want to uh uh provide an
 
02:12:24.530 --> 02:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
opinion on that before you move forward
 
02:12:27.229 --> 02:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about the same case uh
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
would be uh Mr Payne against right away
 
02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
pain B right away correct uh he's a
 
02:12:34.729 --> 02:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
former employer employee he says so he
 
02:12:36.410 --> 02:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
was employed by them
 
02:12:41.390 --> 02:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
so that's not my recollection of the
 
02:12:46.129 --> 02:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
case so I'm reading from a former
 
02:12:48.109 --> 02:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
employee sued right away for failing to
 
02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
make reasonable accommodations okay so
 
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
he's if he was awesome he was already
 
02:12:57.649 --> 02:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:59.930 --> 02:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:13:03.290 --> 02:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd uh
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
either make a make a suggestion that we
 
02:13:09.950 --> 02:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
we take a look at what occupations uh we
 
02:13:11.810 --> 02:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
should have out of this you know there
 
02:13:13.550 --> 02:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
are federal protections for truck
 
02:13:15.890 --> 02:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
drivers and what have you uh you know
 
02:13:18.109 --> 02:13:18.119 align:start position:0%
there's there's other things that um you
 
02:13:20.209 --> 02:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
know construction type things that uh
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
you know we should we should be
 
02:13:24.290 --> 02:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
taking out of this
 
02:13:26.450 --> 02:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
but um and there's there'll be a lot of
 
02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
occupations that will will fit under it
 
02:13:30.770 --> 02:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:13:33.109 --> 02:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
02:13:34.970 --> 02:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we want to go with any
 
02:13:37.250 --> 02:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
you know individual occupations or just
 
02:13:40.370 --> 02:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
a a blanket statement any any occupation
 
02:13:42.290 --> 02:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
that may involve the health and safety
 
02:13:45.169 --> 02:13:45.179 align:start position:0%
of others um and I I think the advice we
 
02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
got at the outset was that that type of
 
02:13:50.450 --> 02:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
language was too broad too vague and
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
would not work particularly well because
 
02:13:55.790 --> 02:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
you could suggest that any employment
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
might be in that category that that's
 
02:14:00.890 --> 02:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
that's why initially they said you know
 
02:14:02.750 --> 02:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
don't use this don't don't use a
 
02:14:10.510 --> 02:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:13.669 --> 02:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
give us time to look over this email it
 
02:14:16.189 --> 02:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
came in this morning
 
02:14:17.450 --> 02:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
um give me a little bit more time to
 
02:14:19.550 --> 02:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
look at the exclusions I still have
 
02:14:22.189 --> 02:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
issue with bus drivers so and how it
 
02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
relates to schools schools are drug-free
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
zone so I wanna kind of bring that piece
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
into my head as an employer are they
 
02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
part of the excluded process or the
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
trust plus drivers part of the excluded
 
02:14:32.639 --> 02:14:34.069 align:start position:0%
trust plus drivers part of the excluded
process

02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:14:35.810 --> 02:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
um and but and I guess the question
 
02:14:37.370 --> 02:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
there would be do they have a CDL
 
02:14:40.490 --> 02:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
license I think
 
02:14:43.129 --> 02:14:43.139 align:start position:0%
in which case they are
 
02:14:46.010 --> 02:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
there are uh
 
02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:47.689 align:start position:0%
there are uh
yeah

02:14:47.689 --> 02:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:14:50.990 --> 02:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
yeah there are the the handicapped vans
 
02:14:54.050 --> 02:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
that they have to school school kids uh
 
02:14:55.609 --> 02:14:55.619 align:start position:0%
you just need a regular driver's license
 
02:14:57.050 --> 02:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:14:59.390 --> 02:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah yes you know so it's not a CDL
 
02:15:04.609 --> 02:15:04.619 align:start position:0%
so yeah so uh but uh maybe
 
02:15:07.129 --> 02:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
go all of us go home and write out a
 
02:15:09.649 --> 02:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
list of carve outs and and present them
 
02:15:12.649 --> 02:15:12.659 align:start position:0%
and we'll do another meeting like uh
 
02:15:14.569 --> 02:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
I know the
 
02:15:17.209 --> 02:15:17.219 align:start position:0%
um the Chairman's intention is to uh
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
exec this on the 16th
 
02:15:22.910 --> 02:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
um so anything we do needs to take that
 
02:15:26.450 --> 02:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
into uh consideration so we would need
 
02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:29.270 align:start position:0%
into uh consideration so we would need
to

02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
we have our work finished by
 
02:15:35.569 --> 02:15:35.579 align:start position:0%
Wednesday the 8th
 
02:15:37.490 --> 02:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
by three o'clock so that it can go into
 
02:15:39.950 --> 02:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
the calendar as an exec
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:46.669 --> 02:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.530 --> 02:15:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.530 --> 02:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:23.290 align:start position:0%
 
question

02:16:23.290 --> 02:16:23.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:26.149 --> 02:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with that before the eighth
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:33.230 --> 02:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chairman sure
 
02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
um I would also like to for the comedian
 
02:16:37.690 --> 02:16:37.700 align:start position:0%
I hate to say it to look at
 
02:16:39.770 --> 02:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
workman's compensation and liability
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
insurance because if
 
02:16:44.990 --> 02:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
an employee does comes to work for them
 
02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have that card gets injured
 
02:16:49.969 --> 02:16:49.979 align:start position:0%
outside of work comes back with that
 
02:16:49.979 --> 02:16:50.870 align:start position:0%
outside of work comes back with that
card

02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
card
 
02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
is the employer now can't terminate or
 
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
deny or take this planning reaction but
 
02:16:57.709 --> 02:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
may lose their insurance coverage
 
02:16:58.969 --> 02:16:58.979 align:start position:0%
because of that because the insurance
 
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
company requires a certain standard or
 
02:17:04.370 --> 02:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
they work when it's comp requires a
 
02:17:06.129 --> 02:17:06.139 align:start position:0%
certain standard
 
02:17:08.690 --> 02:17:08.700 align:start position:0%
this would tie the hands of the employer
 
02:17:10.370 --> 02:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
saying okay well I can't terminate you
 
02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
now I have to go out and find all new
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
coverages for Car Insurance liability
 
02:17:18.110 --> 02:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
insurance truck insurance workman's
 
02:17:19.849 --> 02:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
compensation I mean you can go on and on
 
02:17:21.169 --> 02:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
and on
 
02:17:23.450 --> 02:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
and what caused it and what if they
 
02:17:25.429 --> 02:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
can't be insured because of their line
 
02:17:27.230 --> 02:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
of work that doesn't fall under the
 
02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:28.070 align:start position:0%
of work that doesn't fall under the
federal

02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
limits or even State limits I would just
 
02:17:33.770 --> 02:17:33.780 align:start position:0%

representative thank you Mr chairman I
 
02:18:15.290 --> 02:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
also want to make the chairman aware
 
02:18:16.849 --> 02:18:16.859 align:start position:0%
that there is a member of honorable
 
02:18:22.730 --> 02:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:28.009 --> 02:18:28.019 align:start position:0%
okay I I I I I was unaware of being a
 
02:18:30.049 --> 02:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
new member of the committee but uh do
 
02:18:31.730 --> 02:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
you have any input
 
02:18:31.740 --> 02:18:32.870 align:start position:0%
you have any input
hi

02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
hi
 
02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:35.750 align:start position:0%
hi
hi

02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:41.690 --> 02:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:43.849 --> 02:18:43.859 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
02:18:51.469 --> 02:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:54.830 --> 02:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh do we have any extra details do
 
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
you also have the amended version no I
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
don't if that was actually going to be a
 
02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:00.610 align:start position:0%
don't if that was actually going to be a
question

02:19:00.610 --> 02:19:00.620 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:19:03.469 --> 02:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you what I'll lend you mine
 
02:19:03.479 --> 02:19:08.209 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you what I'll lend you mine
okay

02:19:08.209 --> 02:19:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:12.169 --> 02:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:14.330 --> 02:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
he's got one
 
02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:17.110 align:start position:0%
he's got one
yeah

02:19:17.110 --> 02:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:31.969 --> 02:19:31.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:34.310 --> 02:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay for those of us who don't know you
 
02:19:36.589 --> 02:19:36.599 align:start position:0%
uh but just stay in it I apologize I was
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:40.669 --> 02:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
immigroman attorney with the New
 
02:19:43.549 --> 02:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor
 
02:19:45.709 --> 02:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
um so there is
 
02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
there is a bit of a change where you
 
02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
have on Roman numeral one and that was
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
going to be my question because on the
 
02:19:56.330 --> 02:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
original bill it said solely because the
 
02:19:58.190 --> 02:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
individual is a qualified patient of the
 
02:19:59.690 --> 02:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire therapeutic cannabis
 
02:20:04.130 --> 02:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
program under RSA 126x and and that was
 
02:20:05.690 --> 02:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
the key to me
 
02:20:08.210 --> 02:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
because that would require both of those
 
02:20:11.090 --> 02:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
elements to be met in order to
 
02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
talk about hiring firing processes so
 
02:20:17.450 --> 02:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
that was definitely altered in here so I
 
02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
just want to take a look if it's okay
 
02:20:25.849 --> 02:20:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:25.859 --> 02:20:34.969 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:20:34.969 --> 02:20:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:37.310 --> 02:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
okay so my understanding is standing in
 
02:20:38.809 --> 02:20:38.819 align:start position:0%
the amendment is it's really just broken
 
02:20:40.130 --> 02:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
down a little bit better instead of
 
02:20:46.370 --> 02:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
um so that took care of one of my
 
02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:49.910 align:start position:0%
um so that took care of one of my
questions

02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:20:56.270 --> 02:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:59.330 --> 02:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
I guess uh you know um the idea of
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
having carve outs uh how
 
02:21:05.809 --> 02:21:05.819 align:start position:0%
what would you what would you have to
 
02:21:07.610 --> 02:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
what kind of input could you give us on
 
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
that well obviously the Department of
 
02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
Labor does not take a position on this
 
02:21:13.730 --> 02:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
particular bill and the general
 
02:21:16.490 --> 02:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
consensus is is whatever this committee
 
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
comes up with and presents and if it's
 
02:21:19.370 --> 02:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
made law
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
we will understand the intent because we
 
02:21:23.809 --> 02:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
have been listening and we will
 
02:21:26.750 --> 02:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
administer it as we have interpreted the
 
02:21:26.760 --> 02:21:28.190 align:start position:0%
administer it as we have interpreted the
statute

02:21:28.190 --> 02:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:28.790 align:start position:0%
statute
um

02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:32.210 --> 02:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
as far as suggestions on carve outs I
 
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
would look at 126 x and make sure that
 
02:21:36.969 --> 02:21:36.979 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be any
 
02:21:39.770 --> 02:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies between whatever this
 
02:21:44.349 --> 02:21:44.359 align:start position:0%
bill ends up being and what's in 126x
 
02:21:47.389 --> 02:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
126x has some protections for employers
 
02:21:49.610 --> 02:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
as far as the hiring and the firing but
 
02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
they have to sign that and I believe
 
02:21:54.050 --> 02:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
that the representative from dhsh Mr
 
02:21:56.510 --> 02:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
Holt even described it there has to be
 
02:21:57.950 --> 02:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
something that has to be signed by the
 
02:22:00.050 --> 02:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
employer that they're accepting the fact
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
that this employee has a therapeutic
 
02:22:06.290 --> 02:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
cannabis card as well as will likely
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
have a positive drug test
 
02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
um if that statute says and I don't have
 
02:22:14.090 --> 02:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
it in front of me but if that statute
 
02:22:16.490 --> 02:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
says as representative infantine said
 
02:22:16.500 --> 02:22:17.929 align:start position:0%
says as representative infantine said
that

02:22:17.929 --> 02:22:17.939 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:22:21.050 --> 02:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
the employer does not have to sign
 
02:22:23.090 --> 02:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
that's a protection that the employer
 
02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Labor would
 
02:22:29.330 --> 02:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
interpret the employer having as okay
 
02:22:31.730 --> 02:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that this is the best
 
02:22:35.929 --> 02:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
candidate for this job because of
 
02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
a b and c but including being on
 
02:22:42.050 --> 02:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis I was listening to
 
02:22:44.330 --> 02:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
some concerns about part of the reason
 
02:22:47.450 --> 02:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
why it was removed from the original
 
02:22:50.990 --> 02:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
Bill language talking about it being too
 
02:22:54.830 --> 02:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
broad about if for safety concerns this
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
would not apply and and that being too
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
broad I understand that
 
02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:00.530 align:start position:0%
broad I understand that
um

02:23:00.530 --> 02:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:03.530 --> 02:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
I think the interpretation based upon
 
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
the statute of Labor looking at this
 
02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
would be looking at specific jobs which
 
02:23:09.650 --> 02:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
goes to the carve outs that you were
 
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
my recommendation would be to make sure
 
02:23:16.610 --> 02:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
that if you do intend to put in carve
 
02:23:20.030 --> 02:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
outs be careful that you don't specify
 
02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
everything down to the letter so that
 
02:23:24.530 --> 02:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in and says okay well you
 
02:23:26.570 --> 02:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
said a b and c but you didn't say d so
 
02:23:28.490 --> 02:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
that doesn't count
 
02:23:30.889 --> 02:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how there it can be
 
02:23:30.899 --> 02:23:32.809 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how there it can be
done

02:23:32.809 --> 02:23:32.819 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:23:35.690 --> 02:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
um but these are concerns that we would
 
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
be looking at if a case were to come
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
into the Department of Labor whether it
 
02:23:42.410 --> 02:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
be under workers comp or whether it be
 
02:23:44.510 --> 02:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
under wage an hour
 
02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
um where we would have to try to
 
02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:47.990 align:start position:0%
um where we would have to try to
interpret

02:23:47.990 --> 02:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
interpret
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
both with 126x as well as under the
 
02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
protections under wage an hour under
 
02:23:57.710 --> 02:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
all the different sections under 281a
 
02:24:00.889 --> 02:24:00.899 align:start position:0%
for the workers comp statute so
 
02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
I would
 
02:24:05.570 --> 02:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
I guess my recommendation on that would
 
02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
be just to
 
02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind as you're looking at
 
02:24:11.230 --> 02:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
particular carve outs
 
02:24:16.610 --> 02:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
cdl's obviously police fire EMT
 
02:24:19.010 --> 02:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
some of them seem obvious
 
02:24:19.020 --> 02:24:20.929 align:start position:0%
some of them seem obvious
but

02:24:20.929 --> 02:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:24:23.330 --> 02:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
if you if you if you make it too finite
 
02:24:28.010 --> 02:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:28.020 --> 02:24:29.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:24:29.150 --> 02:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:31.969 align:start position:0%
um
representative

02:24:31.969 --> 02:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:36.070 --> 02:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
um just want to be clear about
 
02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:37.870 align:start position:0%
um just want to be clear about
126x3

02:24:37.870 --> 02:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
126x3
 
02:24:41.510 --> 02:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
as I understand it you can't
 
02:24:44.929 --> 02:24:44.939 align:start position:0%
be in possession of cannabis on the job
 
02:24:46.910 --> 02:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
without assigned permission
 
02:24:49.250 --> 02:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
you can't be under the influence of
 
02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis on the job without signing
 
02:24:51.359 --> 02:24:53.090 align:start position:0%
cannabis on the job without signing
permission

02:24:53.090 --> 02:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
permission
 
02:24:53.100 --> 02:24:54.469 align:start position:0%
permission
um

02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:56.990 --> 02:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't believe
 
02:25:02.270 --> 02:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
you cannot be under the influence
 
02:25:07.250 --> 02:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
however you might test positive for
 
02:25:10.809 --> 02:25:10.819 align:start position:0%
cannabis or for THC
 
02:25:13.550 --> 02:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
so it seems that if
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
if you're one of these nighttime users
 
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
and you only take it before you go to
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
sleep and you're no longer under the
 
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
influence in the morning then you can go
 
02:25:25.010 --> 02:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
to work you have nothing signed by the
 
02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
employer because you're not bringing it
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
to work with you you're not under the
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
influence at work but you would still be
 
02:25:34.429 --> 02:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
subject to a positive test
 
02:25:36.290 --> 02:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
um so you have not
 
02:25:36.300 --> 02:25:38.809 align:start position:0%
um so you have not
um uh

02:25:38.809 --> 02:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:25:42.650 --> 02:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
the employer can't uh choose not to
 
02:25:44.210 --> 02:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
employ you
 
02:25:48.349 --> 02:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
um or can't discipline or terminate you
 
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
um for being under the influence or
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
being in possession because you were
 
02:25:54.349 --> 02:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
none of the above you simply tested
 
02:25:54.359 --> 02:25:55.990 align:start position:0%
none of the above you simply tested
positive

02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
positive
 
02:25:59.270 --> 02:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
by interpreting that correctly I see Mr
 
02:26:02.210 --> 02:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
Holtz nodding his head so I'm continuing
 
02:26:10.130 --> 02:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:12.349 --> 02:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
today I would have I would like to be
 
02:26:14.030 --> 02:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
able to do that to give you a complete
 
02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
answer on that but I can take it to a
 
02:26:17.330 --> 02:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
different level and look at it from the
 
02:26:21.490 --> 02:26:21.500 align:start position:0%
perspective of any other substance
 
02:26:25.730 --> 02:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
if you're taking some form of an opiate
 
02:26:28.849 --> 02:26:28.859 align:start position:0%
and that opiate you took at
 
02:26:31.130 --> 02:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
you know the night time but you're still
 
02:26:32.990 --> 02:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
feeling the effects because maybe you're
 
02:26:36.050 --> 02:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
not in a continuous opiate user you're
 
02:26:37.809 --> 02:26:37.819 align:start position:0%
still feeling the effects but you're not
 
02:26:39.889 --> 02:26:39.899 align:start position:0%
necessarily Under the Influence or
 
02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
you're not impaired if you drink alcohol
 
02:26:44.809 --> 02:26:44.819 align:start position:0%
all weekend long and you showed up for
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
work on Monday
 
02:26:49.010 --> 02:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
you may have the appearance of someone
 
02:26:52.190 --> 02:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
who drank all weekend long but you may
 
02:26:56.210 --> 02:26:56.220 align:start position:0%
not be under the influence or impaired
 
02:26:56.220 --> 02:26:56.750 align:start position:0%
not be under the influence or impaired
um

02:26:56.750 --> 02:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:58.070 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
I think that we can look at
 
02:27:03.590 --> 02:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis in that suggest and I I would
 
02:27:05.389 --> 02:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
have to look at some of the statue too
 
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
where it talks about you can't prescribe
 
02:27:11.090 --> 02:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis as opposed to calling it a
 
02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
medication I believe there was a request
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
as far as a definition between
 
02:27:16.190 --> 02:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
medication it was it was made very clear
 
02:27:18.349 --> 02:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
to me by my doctor that you are not
 
02:27:20.330 --> 02:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
getting a prescription from me you were
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
simply getting
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to fill out the form to
 
02:27:27.530 --> 02:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
allow you to have the card and and
 
02:27:29.330 --> 02:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
that's the last interaction you have
 
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
with the doctor
 
02:27:32.690 --> 02:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
they simply
 
02:27:34.730 --> 02:27:34.740 align:start position:0%
um you know give you the authorization
 
02:27:36.530 --> 02:27:36.540 align:start position:0%
get the card
 
02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
um but I guess my
 
02:27:42.889 --> 02:27:42.899 align:start position:0%
I understood for Mr Holt that there's a
 
02:27:44.809 --> 02:27:44.819 align:start position:0%
difference between impairment and being
 
02:27:47.090 --> 02:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
under the influence
 
02:27:50.210 --> 02:27:50.220 align:start position:0%
um and impairment is as we've discussed
 
02:27:50.220 --> 02:27:52.250 align:start position:0%
um and impairment is as we've discussed
uh

02:27:52.250 --> 02:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:54.170 --> 02:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
somewhat difficult to track but not
 
02:27:56.690 --> 02:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
impossible I would say being under the
 
02:27:58.070 --> 02:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
influence is probably thoroughly
 
02:28:00.730 --> 02:28:00.740 align:start position:0%
impossible to detect because you
 
02:28:03.530 --> 02:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
basically you
 
02:28:03.540 --> 02:28:04.370 align:start position:0%
basically you
um

02:28:04.370 --> 02:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:06.530 --> 02:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
you've still got THC in your system but
 
02:28:08.090 --> 02:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
it's not no longer doing anything
 
02:28:10.910 --> 02:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
because it's you just got the uh
 
02:28:13.250 --> 02:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
positive test but essentially the
 
02:28:15.849 --> 02:28:15.859 align:start position:0%
nighttime user I from what I understand
 
02:28:18.770 --> 02:28:18.780 align:start position:0%
is generally deemed to be no longer
 
02:28:20.450 --> 02:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
Under the Influence when they go to work
 
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
the next day
 
02:28:24.830 --> 02:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
02:28:27.170 --> 02:28:27.180 align:start position:0%
so I I guess I was just trying to
 
02:28:30.050 --> 02:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
clarify and maybe I need to give you a
 
02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
chance to review but um it seems like a
 
02:28:36.530 --> 02:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
card holder
 
02:28:41.210 --> 02:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
cannabis therapeutic cannabis user or a
 
02:28:41.220 --> 02:28:42.770 align:start position:0%
cannabis therapeutic cannabis user or a
patient

02:28:42.770 --> 02:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
patient
 
02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:43.849 align:start position:0%
patient
um

02:28:43.849 --> 02:28:43.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:46.490 --> 02:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
can you get nothing it can can carry on
 
02:28:47.929 --> 02:28:47.939 align:start position:0%
with their life without having their
 
02:28:50.230 --> 02:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
employer sign anything
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
because they're neither Under the
 
02:28:56.750 --> 02:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
Influence nor in the possession of
 
02:28:59.050 --> 02:28:59.060 align:start position:0%
cannabis on the job
 
02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
so I don't believe
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
as you stated a few a little while ago
 
02:29:06.530 --> 02:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
that that could be a reason for an
 
02:29:09.349 --> 02:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
employer to either fire or not hire
 
02:29:09.359 --> 02:29:10.130 align:start position:0%
employer to either fire or not hire
um

02:29:10.130 --> 02:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
because basically if the person it
 
02:29:13.849 --> 02:29:13.859 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit either of those two
 
02:29:13.859 --> 02:29:15.590 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit either of those two
circumstances

02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
um there's no need for the employer to
 
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
sign anything
 
02:29:21.410 --> 02:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
I think the biggest difficulty that
 
02:29:22.730 --> 02:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
comes out of that and I think it's been
 
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned before is trying to make that
 
02:29:26.450 --> 02:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
determination as to whether or not they
 
02:29:27.950 --> 02:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
are under the influence or they are
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
impaired from being able to do their job
 
02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
um being under the influence can simply
 
02:29:36.050 --> 02:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
mean uh for somebody who takes
 
02:29:38.210 --> 02:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
painkillers you're under the influence
 
02:29:40.010 --> 02:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
of it because it's easing your pain so
 
02:29:41.690 --> 02:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
obviously it's still working
 
02:29:45.050 --> 02:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
but are you impaired by it and that's
 
02:29:46.730 --> 02:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
that's the difference that would be
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
presented at a hearing
 
02:29:51.170 --> 02:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
um and and address causal issues as to
 
02:29:53.330 --> 02:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
whether or not any particular in looking
 
02:29:54.889 --> 02:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
at a workers comp case whether a
 
02:29:56.690 --> 02:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
particular injury was actually caused by
 
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
an impairment or was just caused by
 
02:30:03.889 --> 02:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
uh employee mistake or you know just a
 
02:30:05.809 --> 02:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
simple accident
 
02:30:05.819 --> 02:30:06.650 align:start position:0%
simple accident
um

02:30:06.650 --> 02:30:06.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:08.690 --> 02:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
02:30:10.610 --> 02:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
that is something that a hearing officer
 
02:30:13.730 --> 02:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
would have to take in evidence for
 
02:30:15.889 --> 02:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
um there may be medical evidence or it
 
02:30:19.010 --> 02:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
may just be observational evidence
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that comes down to you have field
 
02:30:24.170 --> 02:30:24.180 align:start position:0%
sobriety tests that law enforcement is
 
02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
able to use to determine if someone is
 
02:30:28.130 --> 02:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
under the influence or impaired while
 
02:30:29.929 --> 02:30:29.939 align:start position:0%
they're driving but then you have
 
02:30:31.730 --> 02:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
certain people who may have a higher
 
02:30:33.410 --> 02:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
tolerance level who may not appear
 
02:30:35.690 --> 02:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
impaired at all but yet they are when it
 
02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
comes to different types of jobs so I
 
02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
think trying to make that determination
 
02:30:43.130 --> 02:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
is the hardest part of all of this
 
02:30:45.410 --> 02:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
to be able to factor that into in the
 
02:30:45.420 --> 02:30:50.389 align:start position:0%
to be able to factor that into in the
language

02:30:50.389 --> 02:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:52.969 --> 02:30:52.979 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
02:30:55.790 --> 02:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
if somebody is uh using therapeutic
 
02:30:55.800 --> 02:30:57.469 align:start position:0%
if somebody is uh using therapeutic
cannabis

02:30:57.469 --> 02:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned well let me back up
 
02:31:01.550 --> 02:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
when you mentioned how somebody using
 
02:31:03.530 --> 02:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
opioids could come to work and be in a
 
02:31:06.889 --> 02:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
fog okay possibly making mistakes and if
 
02:31:09.469 --> 02:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
somebody using therapeutic mechanists is
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:16.130 --> 02:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
if this became law would the employer be
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
prohibited from saying I can't use you
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
anymore I can't use you in this state I
 
02:31:23.090 --> 02:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
can't you know you you're you know you
 
02:31:24.650 --> 02:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
might not be impaired but you're
 
02:31:26.690 --> 02:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
certainly not doing a very good job
 
02:31:28.730 --> 02:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
would that um would that prohibit the
 
02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
employer from laying off until the
 
02:31:34.490 --> 02:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
condition improves or possibly firing
 
02:31:37.429 --> 02:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
first I would point out again let's make
 
02:31:39.230 --> 02:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
sure that there's no inconsistency
 
02:31:40.790 --> 02:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
between the bill that you're going to
 
02:31:44.809 --> 02:31:44.819 align:start position:0%
present and 126x but that being said
 
02:31:47.030 --> 02:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
I think that the Department of Labor
 
02:31:49.070 --> 02:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
would look at the employer having the
 
02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
argument that you this employee is no
 
02:31:52.680 --> 02:31:54.650 align:start position:0%
argument that you this employee is no
longer

02:31:54.650 --> 02:31:54.660 align:start position:0%
longer
 
02:31:57.170 --> 02:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
um safe in the environment safe with
 
02:31:59.570 --> 02:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
other employees safe with the activities
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
of the specific job tasks that he or she
 
02:32:02.640 --> 02:32:03.650 align:start position:0%
of the specific job tasks that he or she
has

02:32:03.650 --> 02:32:03.660 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:32:05.870 --> 02:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
would they have an argument I think
 
02:32:07.309 --> 02:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
that's going to end up going to an
 
02:32:09.950 --> 02:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
employment lawyer and most likely a
 
02:32:12.469 --> 02:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
civil case if that person is terminated
 
02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
as far as the Department of Labor is
 
02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:16.130 align:start position:0%
as far as the Department of Labor is
concerned

02:32:16.130 --> 02:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
02:32:18.770 --> 02:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
the way it would come into play in a lot
 
02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
of circumstances would be in a workers
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
compensation case where somebody let's
 
02:32:26.210 --> 02:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
say is under a specific prescription for
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
a painkiller an opiate
 
02:32:30.650 --> 02:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
if they're taking it as that it is
 
02:32:32.690 --> 02:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
prescribed which in most cases it's a
 
02:32:35.210 --> 02:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
it's a PRN or an as needed type of a
 
02:32:37.490 --> 02:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
prescription if they're taking it as
 
02:32:40.910 --> 02:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
prescribed and the employer is accepting
 
02:32:43.070 --> 02:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that yes we can go ahead and
 
02:32:45.410 --> 02:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
accommodate what we need to do we're
 
02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
just going to keep you away from things
 
02:32:49.550 --> 02:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
where safety is an issue
 
02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
then the employer has accepted that and
 
02:32:54.469 --> 02:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
underneath the statute if the employer
 
02:32:57.710 --> 02:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
knows that that person is under the
 
02:33:00.110 --> 02:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
influence that can't be a defense to
 
02:33:03.530 --> 02:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
terminate them or to refuse any benefits
 
02:33:05.090 --> 02:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
but what
 
02:33:07.070 --> 02:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
what the employer's obligation at that
 
02:33:08.570 --> 02:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
point in times make sure not only that
 
02:33:10.969 --> 02:33:10.979 align:start position:0%
an employee is safe and the employees
 
02:33:14.270 --> 02:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
working with that person are safe the
 
02:33:17.270 --> 02:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
same thing would be applied or should be
 
02:33:19.670 --> 02:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
applied in a situation where there's
 
02:33:22.070 --> 02:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
if that employer does not believe that
 
02:33:27.290 --> 02:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
the use of therapeutic can and they
 
02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
don't know when they're using it keep
 
02:33:30.650 --> 02:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
that in mind there because there's no
 
02:33:33.469 --> 02:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
prescription there's no timeline
 
02:33:35.929 --> 02:33:35.939 align:start position:0%
and that's a question I have had for a
 
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
long time how does that work
 
02:33:42.650 --> 02:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
um but if the employer sees that there
 
02:33:45.650 --> 02:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
is an issue with safety
 
02:33:48.530 --> 02:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
that employer has an argument
 
02:33:50.570 --> 02:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
how strong that is will depend on
 
02:33:53.330 --> 02:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
unemployment lawyer but that employer
 
02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
would have an argument that that person
 
02:33:56.809 --> 02:33:56.819 align:start position:0%
was no longer the best person for this
 
02:34:00.530 --> 02:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
job not because he was Ill not under the
 
02:34:03.469 --> 02:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
Ada but because the use of whatever
 
02:34:03.479 --> 02:34:05.090 align:start position:0%
Ada but because the use of whatever
substance

02:34:05.090 --> 02:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
substance
 
02:34:09.710 --> 02:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:13.670 --> 02:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
how how about um in a position where uh
 
02:34:15.950 --> 02:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
say for instance uh you handle a lot of
 
02:34:18.650 --> 02:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
money you're making a lot of mistakes
 
02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
um you know and you're you have one of
 
02:34:23.450 --> 02:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
these cards uh what rights does the
 
02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
employer have
 
02:34:26.570 --> 02:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
well in that particular case you're not
 
02:34:28.190 --> 02:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with a safety issue you're
 
02:34:29.690 --> 02:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
dealing with a lot of mistakes which
 
02:34:32.090 --> 02:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
would be underneath the regular laws of
 
02:34:34.730 --> 02:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
at-will employment now it has nothing to
 
02:34:37.370 --> 02:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
do with you know how do you make an
 
02:34:39.950 --> 02:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
accommodation for a teller not being
 
02:34:43.130 --> 02:34:43.140 align:start position:0%
able to count because he or she is on
 
02:34:46.849 --> 02:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
Med uh excuse me therapeutic cannabis
 
02:34:49.070 --> 02:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
um so then you have the ability to
 
02:34:51.410 --> 02:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
terminate someone for cause and cause
 
02:34:54.290 --> 02:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
would be no longer being able to perform
 
02:34:56.389 --> 02:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
the tasks of the job that you were hired
 
02:34:58.610 --> 02:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
for so they wouldn't be able to just use
 
02:35:00.590 --> 02:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
this card as an excuse and you can't
 
02:35:03.290 --> 02:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
fire me is what I'm saying would they of
 
02:35:05.389 --> 02:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
course everybody tries to do whatever
 
02:35:07.250 --> 02:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
they need to do
 
02:35:09.530 --> 02:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
um how it would pan out in a hearing
 
02:35:11.570 --> 02:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
would determine the evidence presented
 
02:35:14.330 --> 02:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
to a hearing officer and have a hearing
 
02:35:16.010 --> 02:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
officer make that decision and possibly
 
02:35:18.650 --> 02:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
go up to an appeal panel from there
 
02:35:27.410 --> 02:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:29.210 --> 02:35:29.220 align:start position:0%
probably have another meeting I know the
 
02:35:29.220 --> 02:35:32.990 align:start position:0%
probably have another meeting I know the
universe

02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
I heard you motion or are you looking to
 
02:35:36.889 --> 02:35:36.899 align:start position:0%
retain but I would say that maybe we
 
02:35:38.510 --> 02:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
meet one more time before we make the
 
02:35:41.030 --> 02:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
motion I mean I know next week we get I
 
02:35:44.590 --> 02:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:47.210 --> 02:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
to meet you on either Monday or Tuesday
 
02:35:50.330 --> 02:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
and if we can't come to any consensus I
 
02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
would recommend that you know we move
 
02:35:54.590 --> 02:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
forward with something then
 
02:35:54.600 --> 02:35:55.790 align:start position:0%
forward with something then
mm-hmm

02:35:55.790 --> 02:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
02:35:58.490 --> 02:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
I I would propose
 
02:36:01.370 --> 02:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the vicinity of 2 10 a.m on
 
02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:05.750 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the vicinity of 2 10 a.m on
Tuesday

02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:08.389 --> 02:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
maybe not that works for me but doesn't
 
02:36:11.870 --> 02:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:13.130 --> 02:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
wow why do you guys don't think they're
 
02:36:16.130 --> 02:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
not going to ask the email sure
 
02:36:18.770 --> 02:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
any information you can get
 
02:36:20.990 --> 02:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mama
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
um the question I have is and you
 
02:36:24.770 --> 02:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
reference it to uh workplace
 
02:36:27.170 --> 02:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
compensation was if workman's
 
02:36:29.870 --> 02:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
compensation determines through their
 
02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:32.770 align:start position:0%
compensation determines through their
initial

02:36:32.770 --> 02:36:32.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:34.969 --> 02:36:34.979 align:start position:0%
their initial triage of the accident
 
02:36:38.090 --> 02:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
that they have I see what you're saying
 
02:36:40.429 --> 02:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
yeah well they have 48 hours to you know
 
02:36:42.830 --> 02:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
or however long it it takes for them to
 
02:36:44.570 --> 02:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
approve a claim and they come back and
 
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
say okay well this person tested
 
02:36:47.929 --> 02:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
positive for this this and this we're
 
02:36:50.270 --> 02:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
not going to honor this claim is the
 
02:36:51.650 --> 02:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
employer now
 
02:36:53.809 --> 02:36:53.819 align:start position:0%
on the hook for all of the
 
02:36:56.450 --> 02:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
some of the injuries no
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is because uh the
 
02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
carrier has up to 21 days to issue a
 
02:37:04.969 --> 02:37:04.979 align:start position:0%
denial in a workers compensation case
 
02:37:07.849 --> 02:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
and I've seen it in several occasions
 
02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
even when I was workers comp defense
 
02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
attorney outside of the Department of
 
02:37:14.210 --> 02:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
Labor where a carrier will deny if there
 
02:37:17.389 --> 02:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
is a positive test for anything it
 
02:37:18.889 --> 02:37:18.899 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if it's an illicit drug
 
02:37:21.230 --> 02:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
or if it's a prescribed drug they'll
 
02:37:22.670 --> 02:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
deny it
 
02:37:25.130 --> 02:37:25.140 align:start position:0%
um the primary basis is usually because
 
02:37:27.530 --> 02:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
the assumption is that that impaired
 
02:37:29.389 --> 02:37:29.399 align:start position:0%
them from doing their job and they
 
02:37:31.429 --> 02:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
didn't let their employer know or or
 
02:37:33.530 --> 02:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
their employer wasn't given an option to
 
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
not allow them to do that job so they
 
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
have up to 21 days to issue a denial
 
02:37:41.210 --> 02:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
but in New Hampshire we also have the
 
02:37:43.610 --> 02:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
concept underneath 281a of payment
 
02:37:45.830 --> 02:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
without prejudice so there can be some
 
02:37:48.190 --> 02:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
payment of medical
 
02:37:51.070 --> 02:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
benefits initial treatments
 
02:37:54.110 --> 02:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
like going to one of the smaller
 
02:37:55.849 --> 02:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
satellite I guess you would call a
 
02:37:57.469 --> 02:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
medical offices and things like that
 
02:37:59.750 --> 02:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's a way that they can be paid by
 
02:38:02.990 --> 02:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
the carrier and later denied as no
 
02:38:05.270 --> 02:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
longer being related pursuant to further
 
02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:06.830 align:start position:0%
longer being related pursuant to further
investigation

02:38:06.830 --> 02:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
02:38:09.410 --> 02:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
until the Department of Labor issues a
 
02:38:09.420 --> 02:38:10.910 align:start position:0%
until the Department of Labor issues a
decision

02:38:10.910 --> 02:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:38:13.250 --> 02:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
the uh there's two different major
 
02:38:15.110 --> 02:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
benefits there's Indemnity benefits
 
02:38:16.790 --> 02:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
which is the disability payments and
 
02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
then there's the medical benefits if the
 
02:38:20.809 --> 02:38:20.819 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor issues a decision
 
02:38:22.790 --> 02:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
that no they were not under the
 
02:38:24.410 --> 02:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
influence or that they're not allowed to
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
use that Statute in order to be able to
 
02:38:29.389 --> 02:38:29.399 align:start position:0%
defend the case
 
02:38:31.610 --> 02:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
then payment of the indemnity benefits
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
does have to be made within five days
 
02:38:36.050 --> 02:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
but is paid by the carrier
 
02:38:37.910 --> 02:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
as far as the medically stay the medical
 
02:38:39.950 --> 02:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
pending appeal
 
02:38:42.770 --> 02:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
if in the end it's all determined that
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's not a compensable injury meaning
 
02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
that this was not a work-related injury
 
02:38:48.790 --> 02:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
or that the employer was able to use
 
02:38:51.530 --> 02:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
intoxication as a defense then it's not
 
02:38:53.750 --> 02:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
a compensable injury it's not
 
02:38:55.670 --> 02:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
compensable to be paid by the carrier
 
02:38:57.230 --> 02:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
and it's not compensable to be paid by
 
02:38:59.389 --> 02:38:59.399 align:start position:0%
the employer this turns into a personal
 
02:38:59.399 --> 02:39:04.210 align:start position:0%
the employer this turns into a personal
injury

02:39:04.210 --> 02:39:04.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:06.830 --> 02:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
so the employee would be able to sue the
 
02:39:08.450 --> 02:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
employer under a personal injury class
 
02:39:08.460 --> 02:39:11.030 align:start position:0%
employer under a personal injury class
no

02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:39:15.290 --> 02:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
of the 281a specifically states that an
 
02:39:17.690 --> 02:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
employee who has accepted this job has
 
02:39:19.790 --> 02:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
also accepted the fact that the employer
 
02:39:21.950 --> 02:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
has Workers Compensation Insurance and
 
02:39:24.290 --> 02:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
it prevents that employee from either
 
02:39:27.050 --> 02:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
filing a lawsuit against a co-worker or
 
02:39:29.809 --> 02:39:29.819 align:start position:0%
filing a lawsuit against the employer so
 
02:39:31.610 --> 02:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
if an employee claims to have been
 
02:39:33.469 --> 02:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
injured on the job but it was determined
 
02:39:35.950 --> 02:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
by a hearing and potentially the appeal
 
02:39:38.570 --> 02:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
that yes he may have been hurt on the
 
02:39:40.370 --> 02:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
job but we believe that defensive
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
intoxication or impairment is a valid
 
02:39:45.770 --> 02:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
defense therefore it's not a compensable
 
02:39:45.780 --> 02:39:47.030 align:start position:0%
defense therefore it's not a compensable
injury

02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
injury
 
02:39:49.309 --> 02:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
the employees stuck with his own health
 
02:39:51.889 --> 02:39:51.899 align:start position:0%
insurance or his own payments
 
02:39:53.630 --> 02:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
02:39:55.010 --> 02:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
I think important
 
02:39:57.530 --> 02:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
um so if that follow up Mr chairman yes
 
02:39:59.809 --> 02:39:59.819 align:start position:0%
just a quick one so if that employee
 
02:40:02.990 --> 02:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
that is relatively impaired injures A
 
02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:04.969 align:start position:0%
that is relatively impaired injures A
co-worker

02:40:04.969 --> 02:40:04.979 align:start position:0%
co-worker
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
how does that play out okay I like that
 
02:40:09.550 --> 02:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
one that one's better
 
02:40:13.550 --> 02:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
so that particular co-worker would have
 
02:40:15.410 --> 02:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
the ability to file a workers
 
02:40:17.389 --> 02:40:17.399 align:start position:0%
compensation claim as well because he
 
02:40:19.490 --> 02:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
was injured on the job he was injured by
 
02:40:21.950 --> 02:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
another employee but it happens in a lot
 
02:40:23.630 --> 02:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
of cases as I'm sure that you've all
 
02:40:25.790 --> 02:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
seen where someone does get injured on
 
02:40:26.929 --> 02:40:26.939 align:start position:0%
the job and it's because of the
 
02:40:29.330 --> 02:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
negligence of another employee
 
02:40:31.250 --> 02:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
strict negligence of course is not a
 
02:40:33.010 --> 02:40:33.020 align:start position:0%
defense in workers compensation
 
02:40:35.330 --> 02:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
impairments can be depending upon
 
02:40:38.570 --> 02:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances if that co-worker
 
02:40:40.730 --> 02:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
was injured
 
02:40:42.770 --> 02:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
I think the department of labor would be
 
02:40:45.170 --> 02:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
looking at the fact that the co-worker
 
02:40:47.750 --> 02:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
was that person impaired
 
02:40:49.910 --> 02:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be an argument most
 
02:40:51.830 --> 02:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
likely by the employer and the carrier
 
02:40:53.870 --> 02:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
if it's determined that the co-worker
 
02:40:56.450 --> 02:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
was not impaired or that his injury was
 
02:41:00.490 --> 02:41:00.500 align:start position:0%
not the result of his own impairment
 
02:41:03.170 --> 02:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
compensability would likely be found for
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:11.690 --> 02:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question it did
 
02:41:13.910 --> 02:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
a person that caused the accident was
 
02:41:16.610 --> 02:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
impaired or under the influence would
 
02:41:18.469 --> 02:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
that play into workman's compensation as
 
02:41:21.469 --> 02:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
well as the cause for the accident
 
02:41:24.110 --> 02:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
underneath the statute that allows the
 
02:41:26.570 --> 02:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
employer to use impairment as a defense
 
02:41:28.490 --> 02:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
it specifically states that not only
 
02:41:31.490 --> 02:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
does the employee have to be impaired or
 
02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
under the influence that employee also
 
02:41:36.110 --> 02:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
the the injury had to have been caused
 
02:41:39.469 --> 02:41:39.479 align:start position:0%
by it for an example
 
02:41:41.630 --> 02:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
um and I can tell you I had a case many
 
02:41:44.630 --> 02:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
years ago employee was a roofer and
 
02:41:46.010 --> 02:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
there was a group of roofers that were
 
02:41:48.469 --> 02:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
working at this particular location
 
02:41:51.410 --> 02:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
and they were climbing up a ladder with
 
02:41:53.450 --> 02:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
shingles over their shoulders they get
 
02:41:55.250 --> 02:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
to the roof they flip the shingles down
 
02:41:57.170 --> 02:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
they go back down the ladder and start
 
02:41:58.969 --> 02:41:58.979 align:start position:0%
the process over again
 
02:42:02.090 --> 02:42:02.100 align:start position:0%
in this particular case a co-worker
 
02:42:04.250 --> 02:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
actually put up the ladder but the
 
02:42:06.410 --> 02:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
employer didn't know that at first so
 
02:42:08.270 --> 02:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
the Assumption was is that the impaired
 
02:42:10.550 --> 02:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
employee put the ladder up
 
02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
grab the first load of shingles got
 
02:42:15.530 --> 02:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
halfway up and the entire ladder toppled
 
02:42:17.809 --> 02:42:17.819 align:start position:0%
over and he fell about 15 feet straight
 
02:42:20.330 --> 02:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
to the ground
 
02:42:23.270 --> 02:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
that case was initially denied because
 
02:42:26.090 --> 02:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
it was determined that the claimant was
 
02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
impaired he had been drinking at
 
02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:29.870 align:start position:0%
impaired he had been drinking at
lunchtime

02:42:29.870 --> 02:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
lunchtime
 
02:42:32.510 --> 02:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
it was eventually paid because the
 
02:42:34.849 --> 02:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
employer knew he had been drinking that
 
02:42:36.830 --> 02:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
eliminated the defense
 
02:42:38.570 --> 02:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
the employer should have never obviously
 
02:42:40.429 --> 02:42:40.439 align:start position:0%
let him back on the job site
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
so the defense wasn't there but let's
 
02:42:44.210 --> 02:42:44.220 align:start position:0%
say the employer didn't know that he was
 
02:42:44.220 --> 02:42:46.010 align:start position:0%
say the employer didn't know that he was
drinking

02:42:46.010 --> 02:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
drinking
 
02:42:48.710 --> 02:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's the arguments would be there for
 
02:42:51.170 --> 02:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
the employer to make then to defend that
 
02:42:54.170 --> 02:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
but for his drinking he wouldn't have
 
02:42:54.180 --> 02:42:55.730 align:start position:0%
but for his drinking he wouldn't have
fallen

02:42:55.730 --> 02:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
fallen
 
02:42:57.950 --> 02:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
so then you have to hit the next step
 
02:43:00.849 --> 02:43:00.859 align:start position:0%
which is did the actual
 
02:43:05.270 --> 02:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
alcoholic impairment cause the injury
 
02:43:07.910 --> 02:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
or did the latter break or you know
 
02:43:10.010 --> 02:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
something else well it turns out that
 
02:43:12.170 --> 02:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
one leg of the ladder had been put in
 
02:43:14.330 --> 02:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
sand and the other leg had been put on
 
02:43:16.910 --> 02:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
something hard so the ladder in the sand
 
02:43:20.389 --> 02:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
of course it tipped exactly it tipped
 
02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
and that's actually what caused him to
 
02:43:23.870 --> 02:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
fall and when we finally made the
 
02:43:26.210 --> 02:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
determination it it was another employee
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
that put up the ladder and mistakenly
 
02:43:32.270 --> 02:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
put it half on Sand half on hard so I go
 
02:43:34.910 --> 02:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
back to what the element of proving had
 
02:43:35.889 --> 02:43:35.899 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:43:39.410 --> 02:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
the did the actual impairment of alcohol
 
02:43:45.950 --> 02:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:49.250 --> 02:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:51.469 --> 02:43:51.479 align:start position:0%
can we reverse that
 
02:43:51.479 --> 02:43:53.710 align:start position:0%
can we reverse that
yeah

02:43:53.710 --> 02:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:55.270 align:start position:0%
yeah
anything

02:43:55.270 --> 02:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:43:58.190 --> 02:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
impaired employee put the ladder in
 
02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
place and the non-perance way into the
 
02:44:02.870 --> 02:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
one that was on
 
02:44:05.710 --> 02:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
Arnold and how that one that is
 
02:44:08.870 --> 02:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay let's start with the non-impaired
 
02:44:10.370 --> 02:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
employee that was climbing the ladder
 
02:44:11.929 --> 02:44:11.939 align:start position:0%
and fell
 
02:44:13.670 --> 02:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
he would file a workers compensation
 
02:44:16.190 --> 02:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
injury it would obviously go to hearing
 
02:44:18.170 --> 02:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
there would be evidence presented but
 
02:44:19.969 --> 02:44:19.979 align:start position:0%
because he was not impaired and was
 
02:44:21.770 --> 02:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
injured on the job the there's a
 
02:44:23.030 --> 02:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
likelihood that they will find
 
02:44:25.070 --> 02:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
compensibility for that particular
 
02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:27.410 align:start position:0%
compensibility for that particular
person

02:44:27.410 --> 02:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:30.469 --> 02:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
if the impaired employee who put it up
 
02:44:32.809 --> 02:44:32.819 align:start position:0%
then there's an argument by the employer
 
02:44:35.330 --> 02:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
to fire for cause
 
02:44:36.830 --> 02:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
but then again that goes under
 
02:44:40.490 --> 02:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:42.889 --> 02:44:42.899 align:start position:0%
representative I believe what if that
 
02:44:46.550 --> 02:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
person was a therapeutic card holder and
 
02:44:50.290 --> 02:44:50.300 align:start position:0%
they just positive for a cannabis can
 
02:44:53.809 --> 02:44:53.819 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids or metabolites of cannabis
 
02:44:56.450 --> 02:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
would the employer be able to fire them
 
02:44:58.190 --> 02:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
up for that
 
02:44:59.809 --> 02:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
that's part of why we're here today
 
02:45:02.750 --> 02:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:06.050 --> 02:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
well it as a former
 
02:45:08.030 --> 02:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
labor guy
 
02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
um basically you're not firing the
 
02:45:12.770 --> 02:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
person for the cannabis use you're
 
02:45:15.110 --> 02:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
firing them for the negligent placement
 
02:45:18.530 --> 02:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
of the latter there therefore I mean the
 
02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
the word solely is in our bill
 
02:45:23.929 --> 02:45:23.939 align:start position:0%
um and there are not being fired solely
 
02:45:26.510 --> 02:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
because of the cannabis card they're
 
02:45:28.130 --> 02:45:28.140 align:start position:0%
being fired because they screwed up and
 
02:45:29.929 --> 02:45:29.939 align:start position:0%
put the ladder in the wrong place it
 
02:45:32.030 --> 02:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
would be fired for cause right
 
02:45:34.250 --> 02:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
one question I have with the insurance
 
02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:35.570 align:start position:0%
one question I have with the insurance
company

02:45:35.570 --> 02:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
company
 
02:45:38.030 --> 02:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
be able to say you know we're not paying
 
02:45:41.030 --> 02:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
because the you know the the employee
 
02:45:43.429 --> 02:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
that put the latter up uh you know it
 
02:45:46.130 --> 02:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
was we tested positive
 
02:45:48.410 --> 02:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
okay uh you know he played a major part
 
02:45:50.389 --> 02:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
in this accident
 
02:45:51.889 --> 02:45:51.899 align:start position:0%
um would
 
02:45:54.050 --> 02:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
wouldn't would an insurance company a
 
02:45:55.790 --> 02:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
workers comp insurance company be able
 
02:45:57.950 --> 02:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
to deny a claim with the liability then
 
02:46:02.510 --> 02:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:06.410 --> 02:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
I have to start by prefacing that we do
 
02:46:08.450 --> 02:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
not handle the insurance coverage
 
02:46:11.570 --> 02:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
aspects I think that's a very good
 
02:46:13.670 --> 02:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
question to ask the Department of
 
02:46:17.630 --> 02:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
Insurance to to provide input but using
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative Holcomb's example going
 
02:46:22.550 --> 02:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
doing the backward one
 
02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:23.870 align:start position:0%
doing the backward one
the

02:46:23.870 --> 02:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:46:25.610 --> 02:46:25.620 align:start position:0%
person who is not impaired the person
 
02:46:27.230 --> 02:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
who actually ended up being injured
 
02:46:28.849 --> 02:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
because of the impaired person putting
 
02:46:30.490 --> 02:46:30.500 align:start position:0%
the ladder in the wrong place
 
02:46:33.650 --> 02:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
the unimpaired person would still have a
 
02:46:35.389 --> 02:46:35.399 align:start position:0%
workers compensation claim it would
 
02:46:37.190 --> 02:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
still have to be presented with all of
 
02:46:39.410 --> 02:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
the evidence to a hearing officer
 
02:46:42.050 --> 02:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
but they were unimpaired
 
02:46:44.389 --> 02:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
they were injured on the job
 
02:46:47.210 --> 02:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
and negligence is not a defense as far
 
02:46:50.389 --> 02:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
as that particular person is concerned
 
02:46:52.190 --> 02:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
um there could be arguments and that's
 
02:46:54.410 --> 02:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
where the evidence comes into play you
 
02:46:56.030 --> 02:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
can't give a black and white answer to
 
02:46:57.650 --> 02:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
these but there could be evidence that
 
02:46:58.910 --> 02:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
comes in that the person who was
 
02:47:00.170 --> 02:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
climbing the ladder may not have been
 
02:47:01.490 --> 02:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
impaired but he knew the other person
 
02:47:01.500 --> 02:47:03.110 align:start position:0%
impaired but he knew the other person
was

02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
maybe shouldn't have trusted the other
 
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
person to place the ladder where he
 
02:47:08.990 --> 02:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
placed it that could be an argument that
 
02:47:11.090 --> 02:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
comes in how it's determined from that
 
02:47:13.010 --> 02:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
point though will determine on what the
 
02:47:15.889 --> 02:47:15.899 align:start position:0%
hearing officer hears and application to
 
02:47:17.389 --> 02:47:17.399 align:start position:0%
the current law
 
02:47:19.550 --> 02:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I can see an insurance company
 
02:47:20.990 --> 02:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
02:47:23.210 --> 02:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
and saying the employer knew of this
 
02:47:27.410 --> 02:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
medical uh therapeutic cannabis card
 
02:47:29.330 --> 02:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
02:47:31.610 --> 02:47:31.620 align:start position:0%
um and he still employed them and this
 
02:47:34.010 --> 02:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
accident happened and this guy tested
 
02:47:35.929 --> 02:47:35.939 align:start position:0%
positive and
 
02:47:38.030 --> 02:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
I can see an insurance company using
 
02:47:40.370 --> 02:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
that as a defense to not pay
 
02:47:43.130 --> 02:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
keep in mind one thing
 
02:47:46.010 --> 02:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
um I I can't remember was in 22 or 21 a
 
02:47:49.190 --> 02:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
new case came out of the Supreme Court
 
02:47:51.410 --> 02:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
um and this one is appeal of panaggio
 
02:47:56.030 --> 02:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
and prior to that the law in New
 
02:47:58.490 --> 02:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is and I think it still is I
 
02:47:59.750 --> 02:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't think it's been changed yet by the
 
02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:01.309 align:start position:0%
don't think it's been changed yet by the
legislature

02:48:01.309 --> 02:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:48:03.730 --> 02:48:03.740 align:start position:0%
um the law was that health insurance
 
02:48:07.190 --> 02:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
carriers were not required to pay for
 
02:48:08.809 --> 02:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana and it's a little off
 
02:48:10.429 --> 02:48:10.439 align:start position:0%
topic but it does come back to the
 
02:48:10.439 --> 02:48:11.210 align:start position:0%
topic but it does come back to the
center

02:48:11.210 --> 02:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
center
 
02:48:13.849 --> 02:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
they were not required to pay for
 
02:48:15.950 --> 02:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana or therapeutic
 
02:48:15.960 --> 02:48:17.750 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana or therapeutic
cannabis

02:48:17.750 --> 02:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
02:48:19.790 --> 02:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
what the Supreme Court in New Hampshire
 
02:48:21.889 --> 02:48:21.899 align:start position:0%
decided was that workers compensation
 
02:48:24.590 --> 02:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
insurers are not the same as health care
 
02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:26.030 align:start position:0%
insurers are not the same as health care
insurers

02:48:26.030 --> 02:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
insurers
 
02:48:29.570 --> 02:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
and so the the Crux of the decision is
 
02:48:31.969 --> 02:48:31.979 align:start position:0%
that if ordered
 
02:48:35.330 --> 02:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
and that's leaves open a whole door of
 
02:48:38.150 --> 02:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
how that works but if ordered
 
02:48:40.610 --> 02:48:40.620 align:start position:0%
the workers compensation carrier would
 
02:48:43.490 --> 02:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
be required to pay if it was ordered by
 
02:48:45.429 --> 02:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
a reputable doctor and was causally
 
02:48:49.010 --> 02:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
medically necessary uh for the
 
02:48:53.090 --> 02:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
particular condition that the person has
 
02:48:56.230 --> 02:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the law is under
 
02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
126.6 is they have to have a therapeutic
 
02:49:01.309 --> 02:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis card so the the doctor would
 
02:49:02.750 --> 02:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
have to go through the same form
 
02:49:05.630 --> 02:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
completion process and that person would
 
02:49:07.910 --> 02:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
have to have a card and and take it from
 
02:49:08.870 --> 02:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
there as far as getting the
 
02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:10.250 align:start position:0%
there as far as getting the
prescriptions

02:49:10.250 --> 02:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
prescriptions
 
02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:12.290 align:start position:0%
prescriptions
but

02:49:12.290 --> 02:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:49:14.270 --> 02:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
um that law
 
02:49:17.030 --> 02:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
kind of opened the door to or that that
 
02:49:19.370 --> 02:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
case kind of open the door to how is
 
02:49:21.230 --> 02:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
that going to be handled from this point
 
02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:22.250 align:start position:0%
that going to be handled from this point
on

02:49:22.250 --> 02:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:49:25.550 --> 02:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
and is it possible because of appeal of
 
02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
panaggio is it possible that a worker's
 
02:49:29.270 --> 02:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
compensation insurance carrier would not
 
02:49:31.730 --> 02:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
be able to deny a claim because someone
 
02:49:34.730 --> 02:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
was on medical marijuana or therapeutic
 
02:49:34.740 --> 02:49:36.290 align:start position:0%
was on medical marijuana or therapeutic
cannabis

02:49:36.290 --> 02:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
02:49:38.210 --> 02:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
is that possible I don't know the
 
02:49:40.610 --> 02:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
answers to those questions
 
02:49:42.530 --> 02:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
um but I think that they are issues that
 
02:49:44.510 --> 02:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
can be brought up if a carrier were to
 
02:49:47.389 --> 02:49:47.399 align:start position:0%
say we're not going to pay because
 
02:49:49.670 --> 02:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
and then you know the argument on the
 
02:49:51.530 --> 02:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
other side would be but appeal of
 
02:49:53.809 --> 02:49:53.819 align:start position:0%
panaggio says you would have to if it
 
02:49:55.849 --> 02:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
was prescribed in a workers compensation
 
02:49:55.859 --> 02:49:57.349 align:start position:0%
was prescribed in a workers compensation
injury

02:49:57.349 --> 02:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
injury
 
02:49:58.969 --> 02:49:58.979 align:start position:0%
there's just a lot of things that can
 
02:50:01.429 --> 02:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
come up in that but I would look to the
 
02:50:04.250 --> 02:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Insurance for input as far
 
02:50:07.130 --> 02:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
as what they would and would not be
 
02:50:09.290 --> 02:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
willing or have to pay for
 
02:50:10.730 --> 02:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:50:12.650 --> 02:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
representative abellini
 
02:50:14.150 --> 02:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:50:17.450 --> 02:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
um so through workman's compensation if
 
02:50:21.290 --> 02:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
the prescribing non-scription if the
 
02:50:22.849 --> 02:50:22.859 align:start position:0%
doctor recommends that program for them
 
02:50:25.010 --> 02:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
to get off opioids work bus compensation
 
02:50:27.710 --> 02:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
would pay anyways because it's it's a
 
02:50:30.410 --> 02:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
reason to get them back to work or are
 
02:50:32.030 --> 02:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
you talking about
 
02:50:35.150 --> 02:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
denying coverage they grew looking in
 
02:50:36.950 --> 02:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
two different directions yes I think we
 
02:50:39.349 --> 02:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
I think we are so um if it was a workers
 
02:50:41.809 --> 02:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
compensation injury if the person and
 
02:50:45.230 --> 02:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
this happens with um uh severe long-term
 
02:50:47.030 --> 02:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
chronic injuries where the person is
 
02:50:49.130 --> 02:50:49.140 align:start position:0%
just in constant pain
 
02:50:51.170 --> 02:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
they've been on opiates for a very long
 
02:50:52.969 --> 02:50:52.979 align:start position:0%
time we obviously went through a period
 
02:50:54.770 --> 02:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
of time several years ago we were trying
 
02:50:57.290 --> 02:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
to reduce the use of opiates
 
02:51:00.530 --> 02:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
um in a situation like that a doctor May
 
02:51:00.540 --> 02:51:02.030 align:start position:0%
um in a situation like that a doctor May
recommend

02:51:02.030 --> 02:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
02:51:04.670 --> 02:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program
 
02:51:06.770 --> 02:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
again we're starting out with a workers
 
02:51:08.690 --> 02:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
comp injury let's start with that Avenue
 
02:51:08.700 --> 02:51:10.370 align:start position:0%
comp injury let's start with that Avenue
first

02:51:10.370 --> 02:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:51:12.050 --> 02:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
so they go through the process the
 
02:51:14.809 --> 02:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
application process they get their card
 
02:51:17.750 --> 02:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
after appeal of panaggio
 
02:51:19.910 --> 02:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
the workers compensation carrier would
 
02:51:24.050 --> 02:51:24.060 align:start position:0%
still have the ability to deny under it
 
02:51:26.450 --> 02:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
was either not causally related not
 
02:51:30.110 --> 02:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable or not medically necessary
 
02:51:32.330 --> 02:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
they go to a hearing it's determined by
 
02:51:35.389 --> 02:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor that it meets
 
02:51:37.070 --> 02:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
all three criteria and it has to meet
 
02:51:39.290 --> 02:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
all three criteria
 
02:51:41.450 --> 02:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
also that the prescribing or the
 
02:51:43.790 --> 02:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
recommending physician
 
02:51:46.309 --> 02:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
is a
 
02:51:48.469 --> 02:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
legitimate physician
 
02:51:51.830 --> 02:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
and that's a concern with the internet
 
02:51:55.090 --> 02:51:55.100 align:start position:0%
um but then you have the appeal process
 
02:51:57.769 --> 02:51:57.779 align:start position:0%
in the end if it's determined that it
 
02:51:59.510 --> 02:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
was causally related to the workers
 
02:52:01.370 --> 02:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
compensation injury medically necessary
 
02:52:05.090 --> 02:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
and reasonable and the department made
 
02:52:07.550 --> 02:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
that determination that would be an
 
02:52:09.650 --> 02:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
order for the workers compensation
 
02:52:11.809 --> 02:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
carrier to pay for it
 
02:52:16.969 --> 02:52:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
okay and the um having worked on
 
02:52:22.070 --> 02:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
workman's compensation as you can tell
 
02:52:26.210 --> 02:52:26.220 align:start position:0%
um could the carriers now decide put in
 
02:52:27.590 --> 02:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
the caveat saying we're not going to
 
02:52:27.600 --> 02:52:29.150 align:start position:0%
the caveat saying we're not going to
ensure

02:52:29.150 --> 02:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
ensure
 
02:52:31.490 --> 02:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
for this type of injury
 
02:52:33.230 --> 02:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
could they do that down the road if this
 
02:52:35.210 --> 02:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
happens to pass and they know there's
 
02:52:36.230 --> 02:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
going to be people that could be
 
02:52:37.910 --> 02:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
impaired working under this
 
02:52:40.550 --> 02:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
classification when you're saying this
 
02:52:41.990 --> 02:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
type of vendor you're talking about the
 
02:52:44.330 --> 02:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
type of injury that may have been caused
 
02:52:46.790 --> 02:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
by the use of therapeutic cannabis
 
02:52:46.800 --> 02:52:48.650 align:start position:0%
by the use of therapeutic cannabis
correct

02:52:48.650 --> 02:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:52:50.570 --> 02:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
I think that's going to open the door to
 
02:52:50.580 --> 02:52:52.550 align:start position:0%
I think that's going to open the door to
a

02:52:52.550 --> 02:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:52:55.090 --> 02:52:55.100 align:start position:0%
a lot of meetings like this
 
02:52:58.969 --> 02:52:58.979 align:start position:0%
I really do and the reason is from the
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor standpoint is we'll
 
02:53:02.630 --> 02:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
get a case in like that and we have to
 
02:53:04.610 --> 02:53:04.620 align:start position:0%
be able to look at the evidence and
 
02:53:06.889 --> 02:53:06.899 align:start position:0%
that's what our hearing officers do
 
02:53:09.349 --> 02:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
so there would have to be a hearing at
 
02:53:10.730 --> 02:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
least to show
 
02:53:13.309 --> 02:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
that the therapeutic cannabis was the
 
02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
cause for them to be able to then turn
 
02:53:17.450 --> 02:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
around and say okay well under our
 
02:53:19.849 --> 02:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
policy we don't have to pay but I think
 
02:53:22.490 --> 02:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
that that probably breaks it into a
 
02:53:25.250 --> 02:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
whole new hearing usually with the
 
02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
department of insurance which is I'm
 
02:53:29.150 --> 02:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
going to say it again I really do
 
02:53:30.710 --> 02:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
believe that we need you would need to
 
02:53:32.349 --> 02:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
get the Department of Insurance involved
 
02:53:35.389 --> 02:53:35.399 align:start position:0%
to make those types of determinations I
 
02:53:37.190 --> 02:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
think it's I think it's a
 
02:53:38.990 --> 02:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
a Pandora's Box
 
02:53:40.790 --> 02:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
and just one final follow-up I know
 
02:53:42.469 --> 02:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to go
 
02:53:44.870 --> 02:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
um years ago we worked on workman's
 
02:53:47.510 --> 02:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
compensation and people before us to
 
02:53:50.030 --> 02:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
bring more insurers into the state
 
02:53:52.969 --> 02:53:52.979 align:start position:0%
would this be a legitimate reason for
 
02:53:57.410 --> 02:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:00.950 --> 02:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
I can't answer that from a state
 
02:54:04.550 --> 02:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge but I would ask you to look at
 
02:54:06.650 --> 02:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
other states around
 
02:54:09.710 --> 02:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
Maine has therapeutic cannabis
 
02:54:11.690 --> 02:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts obviously
 
02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
it has it open I would look at the other
 
02:54:16.010 --> 02:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
states around and see how the insurance
 
02:54:17.929 --> 02:54:17.939 align:start position:0%
carriers have been handling that are
 
02:54:20.510 --> 02:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
they paying workers compensation are
 
02:54:22.490 --> 02:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
they denying it is there language that's
 
02:54:24.650 --> 02:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
being inserted most workers compensation
 
02:54:28.610 --> 02:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
policies are fairly template
 
02:54:28.620 --> 02:54:30.170 align:start position:0%
policies are fairly template
um so

02:54:30.170 --> 02:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:54:31.969 --> 02:54:31.979 align:start position:0%
are are they adding any type of
 
02:54:35.090 --> 02:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
endorsements that say if this then that
 
02:54:37.070 --> 02:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
I would I would look around to see if
 
02:54:38.690 --> 02:54:38.700 align:start position:0%
that was going on if that's not going
 
02:54:41.690 --> 02:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
around in other states then my own
 
02:54:43.370 --> 02:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
personal opinion would be that it
 
02:54:52.610 --> 02:54:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:52.620 --> 02:54:53.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:54:53.530 --> 02:54:53.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:56.090 --> 02:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
getting back to meeting again I I
 
02:54:59.389 --> 02:54:59.399 align:start position:0%
suggested 10 I think uh you suggested
 
02:55:04.969 --> 02:55:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:07.010 --> 02:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday
 
02:55:10.030 --> 02:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
yep one or two that'll work for me
 
02:55:12.349 --> 02:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
it was great because I can get out early
 
02:55:15.650 --> 02:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
but she's not part of your committee but
 
02:55:18.050 --> 02:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
um yeah one or two is fine with me let's
 
02:55:20.030 --> 02:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
do one o'clock one o'clock on Tuesday
 
02:55:23.870 --> 02:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:25.670 --> 02:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
I want to thank the members and the
 
02:55:32.710 --> 02:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:34.610 --> 02:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
let's carry on with what we're doing
 
02:55:41.950 --> 02:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:47.469 --> 02:55:47.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:53.690 --> 02:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:59.929 --> 02:55:59.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:02.269 --> 02:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
yeah we close this meeting
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay so that's Tuesday the 7th at 1
 
02:56:04.800 --> 02:56:09.469 align:start position:0%
okay so that's Tuesday the 7th at 1
right

02:56:09.469 --> 02:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:19.610 --> 02:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:21.710 --> 02:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully if I don't get sucked into the
 
02:56:21.720 --> 02:56:25.690 align:start position:0%
hopefully if I don't get sucked into the
lifestyle

02:56:25.690 --> 02:56:25.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:30.650 --> 02:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:42.590 --> 02:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
