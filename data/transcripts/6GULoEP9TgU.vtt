years probably more have been friends
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
most of that
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
time on September 9th
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
2023 faith and I attended a celebration
 
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
of life for Bob at the Sheridan Tara in
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
nasua the celebration was supposed to
 
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
start at 1:00 p.m. so faith and I
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
figured we could get there by 12:30 and
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
beat the
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
rush this was held in a very big room
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
with a bar adjacent and it was
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
packed people were lined up around the
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
room waiting to talk to Priscilla and
 
00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:51.190 align:start position:0%
room waiting to talk to Priscilla and
Bob's

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
Bob's
 
00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:53.799 align:start position:0%
children in later conversations with
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
Priscilla I
 
00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
learned nearly half nearly all
 
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:03.799 align:start position:0%
the folks lined up had a story to tell
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
about how Bob the Bob they knew and how
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
many of them how they were related with
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
we they related how Bob had helped them
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
in their in their lives and influence
 
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
their lives we figured the line would
 
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
lessen soon and we'd be able to uh get
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
in line to pay our respects never
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
happened people kept coming in the line
 
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.750 align:start position:0%
happened people kept coming in the line
never

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
never
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
shortened the facility operator
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
estimated that some 12200 people showed
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
up that
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
day due to a health issue we had to
 
00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
leave as it was approaching time to
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
dinner we never we never we had time to
 
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
pay our respects we had dinner with
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
Priscilla a month later and found out
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
that she never took a break from
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
greeting those who who came and stood in
 
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
line she wanted to hear everything they
 
00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
had to
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
say she could do no
 
00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:06.039 align:start position:0%
less I guess the old adage is
 
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
true behind every strong man is a really
 
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.830 align:start position:0%
true behind every strong man is a really
strong

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
woman Bob k e Cay Jr was a complex man
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
who lived by a simple code work harder
 
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
than everybody else keep your word help
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
those in need and stand your ground Bob
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
had the ability to befriend anyone and
 
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
make them his friend he his sense of
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
humor his quick wit his ability to
 
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
connect with people made him
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
approachable and respected he also had
 
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
the Gift of Gab and could get up and
 
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
speak off the cuff these were his
 
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
natural gifts he was also a very
 
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.070 align:start position:0%
natural gifts he was also a very
strategic

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
strategic
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
thinker no wonder he excelled in
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
politics but first Bob made a living as
 
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.070 align:start position:0%
politics but first Bob made a living as
a

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
builder he was an excellent Builder he
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
if you're from Nashua you probably know
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
the Lilac Blossom out on Amber Street in
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
the Greystone Plaza that was Bob's
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
handiwork and he was proud of it I
 
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
recall some very nice dinners
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
there but that was moons
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
ago it's been a while since I've been
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
weekend most of us excuse me most of of
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
us in this building since 1994 probably
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
knew Bob in a role of politician in his
 
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
four terms in the house he was an
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
assistant Majority Leader a majority
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
caucus whip which I just found out what
 
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
that was while I was walked in and the
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
speaker Pro Temp as Bob once said the
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
title means nothing it's what you do
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
with it that counts remember Bob first
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
and always was a builder you don't
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
survive in that business very long
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
without a good good
 
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
reputation or by not getting the job
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
done some once said with 400 members
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
getting things done okay with 400
 
00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:10.039 align:start position:0%
members getting things done in the house
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
was like hurting cats through a car
 
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
wash I think I said
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
that he once told me he was convinced he
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
convinced the then speaker to let him go
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
in and monitor certain committees with a
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
blank committee appointments forms in
 
00:21:25.279 --> 00:21:26.350 align:start position:0%
blank committee appointments forms in
his

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
pocket which he used a in on committees
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
which might be having
 
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
problems he made his
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
reputation like to read you some
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
words by
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
someone who was who's was with Bob at
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
those at those
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
times and we these words were written in
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
the condolence section of the federal of
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
the funeral home website by soon after
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
Bob's passing this news is heartbreaking
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
Bob was not only a man of his work
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
he was an advocate for the best
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
interests of his constituents and
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
community that doesn't mean we always
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
agreed on Solutions but when we we did
 
00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
things got done he was a man possessed
 
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
of real empathy and so much belief in
 
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
the institutions of New Hampshire
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
government I feel myself honored to have
 
00:22:21.149 --> 00:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
known Bob in the House and
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
Senate it was spoken by Peter ho Burling
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
who was the house a house Democrat atic
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
served yeah hearken back to the Bob's
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
code I just talked
 
00:22:45.549 --> 00:22:45.559 align:start position:0%
about the harder we
 
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
work the harder than every work harder
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
than everybody else and keep your word
 
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.830 align:start position:0%
than everybody else and keep your word
that

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
was that in 2002 Bob moved on to the
 
00:22:58.159 --> 00:22:59.149 align:start position:0%
was that in 2002 Bob moved on to the
Senate

00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
actually he ran over the Senate with one
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
term Senator the with a one-term Sen
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
when a one-term senator became Senate
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
President and a zero term Senator Bob
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
becoming majority leader which he had
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
for three
 
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
years he got a taste for National
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
politics and hooked up with Arkansas
 
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
Governor Mike Tuck's presidential
 
00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
campaign again these words were again
 
00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:32.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
were written in the funeral home website
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
passing and I lost it NOP right
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
here dear Bob it was friends of First
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
Sight during a hot day in Iowa at the
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
state fair when you deafly took on
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
several young and buffed 20s something
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
20-some year olds to protect some rather
 
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
vulnerable volunteers on your side on
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
our side you probably were outnumbered
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
and outgunned but that didn't matter to
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.159 --> 00:24:18.909 align:start position:0%
 
day

00:24:18.909 --> 00:24:18.919 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
again go back to hearken back to Bob's
 
00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:24.039 align:start position:0%
code help those in need and stand your
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
ground I'll tell you Bob was not
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
outnumbered you knew Bob he was big guy
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
and he worked out a lot he didn't sleep
 
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
much and that time at the time he didn't
 
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
sleep he was always working out so I
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
think they were outnumbered so Bob also
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
made a run for Congress in 2008 he
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
played second PR uh place in the primary
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
I refrain from commenting on what to say
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
about the about the Republican party at
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
that time other than to say we did not
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
have the quality of leadership in it
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
that we'd have to today after that Bob
 
00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
became a founding partner in legislative

00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
after I Le the true extent of Bob's
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
generosity empathy and I learned it was
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
infinite and
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
unknowable he really did care about
 
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
others and it was part of his
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
code but you didn't I didn't know much
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
about it he didn't hide it he didn't bro
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
but he didn't broadcast it either he
 
00:26:12.909 --> 00:26:12.919 align:start position:0%
worked with many local

spotlight but as a generous man he hid
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
from the spotlight he shunned it he
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
didn't want people to
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
know I suspect one of the reasons Bob
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
liked to be involved in local boards and

00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
offered it to the
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
organization and then Bob tragically
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
left us and the project was in
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
limbo determined to make Bob's wish a
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
reality Priscilla finished the project
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
and the house is now in the hands of the
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
mission with Bob I learned that it was
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
never about the
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
organizations it was always about the
 
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
people from giving the fire department a

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
was fun to be around he has ability to
 
00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:17.799 align:start position:0%
keep a straight face when pulling a

Highway committee Cliff Newton raises
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
his hand and tells a story about how Bob
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
used to hide Cliff's name plate when
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
Cliff was chair a fishing game and they
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
all would have a laugh about
 
00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
it that was
 
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.080 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker we
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
have voted on this topic many times
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
about whether a person should be uh able
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
to marry at 16 with their parents'
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
permission and the course permission
 
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
or if it should be barred
 
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
entirely up to 18 and I think that there
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
is another category that that this body
 
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.950 align:start position:0%
is another category that that this body
should

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
consider a lot of the uh the the
 
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
discussion inside of the committee
 
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
report had to do with whether or not
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
someone is mature enough to be able to
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
handle essentially this
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
decision and I believe that you know we
 
00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
have this standard of 18 being able to
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
understand and be held responsible for
 
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.910 align:start position:0%
understand and be held responsible for
their

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
decisions as a general order of course
 
00:39:59.710 --> 00:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
and then we have other court proceedings
 
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
that decide that that make judgments on
 
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
a case-by casee basis sometimes if
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
someone is incompetent even at 18 the
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
judge May rule that they're not able to
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
do certain things and if in cases where
 
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh a judge considers a minor and has the
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to decide whether they are
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
capable of making this decision for
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
themselves that is considered uh
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
granting them
 
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
emancipation and in a lot of the the
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
negative remarks I hear from an
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
opposition is that you know in some
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
other state or some other country
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
someone did something
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
that Hoodwink the judge into granting
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
emancipation but I say that they are not
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
subject to our statute our stat statute
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
requires that it's in the best interest
 
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
of that minor that they live apart from
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
their parents for three months or
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
longer that they are able to be
 
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient both financially and in
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
their personal
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
affairs these are
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
not very low bars in New Hampshire and I
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
submit to you that if they are able to
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
meet these bars that they are able to
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
understand the consequences of their
 
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
actions and so I implore you to vote for
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
to allow for those people that have been
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
judged by the court for it to be in
 
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
their best interest and that they are
 
00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
able to understand the ramifications of
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
their actions that they be able to take
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
that action it is not an inherently
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
immoral action that they're doing it's
 
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
just whether or not they are capable of
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
understanding that action and accepting
 
00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
the consequences of that action so I
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
hope you vote for this amendment thank
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
Peto thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
with all due respect this amendment
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
defeats the purpose of the underlining
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
bill which is to raise the minimum age
 
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
of marriage to 18 the bill came to us
 
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
unanimously from the other chamber and
 
00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
likewise the children and family law
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
committee submitted it to our consent
 
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
calendar and we would not be here
 
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
discussing this if it wasn't for an
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
amendment brought forth by a member not
 
00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:38.839 align:start position:0%
from our committee the fact of the
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
matter is that emancipated miners cannot
 
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
vote they cannot purchase or consume
 
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
tobacco or alcohol they canot purchase
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
firearms why then would we allow for an
 
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
age exception for marriage and nothing
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
else more so emancipated miners are
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
among the most vulnerable of children
 
00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
why then would we want to put them in a
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
position to be taken advantage of by
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
manipulative unsavory adults the bottom
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
line is this plain and simple children
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
should not be getting married and there
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
should be no
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
exception I ask that you vote itl on the
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%

child marriage a human rights violation
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%

taking the stance that it is in some

I understand that some people had uh
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
qualms with the First Amendment having
 
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
the the 16 to 18 being struck in and
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
that this amendment is just specifically
 
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
only uh dealing with uh emancipation and
 
00:49:50.109 --> 00:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that that will uh alleviate
 
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
some of those qualms uh that that
 
00:49:57.789 --> 00:49:57.799 align:start position:0%

Speaker setting a standard for an
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
marriageable age is setting a rule and
 
00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:16.799 align:start position:0%
like most rules there are exceptions and
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
I want to talk to you about the
 
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
exception of
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
pregnancy in my family and my friends
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
have two examples of minors who got
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
married because of pregnancy
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
one son one daughter of a friend and her
 
00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.670 align:start position:0%
one son one daughter of a friend and her
boyfriend

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
boyfriend
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
celebrated getting engaged they were
 
00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
high school sweethearts with getting
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
pregnant suddenly the love marriage
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
babies timeline is
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
reversed they elected to get
 
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
married because that offered to the
 
00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
young woman things that she didn't have
 
00:50:55.789 --> 00:50:55.799 align:start position:0%
before stability provision protection
 
00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
and a chance for a young family to be a
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
family before a baby
 
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
arrived the goal was still the same
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
marriage and raising a family together
 
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
they just got there in a little
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
different timeline in my own
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
relatives a 17-year-old was uh pregnant
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
by a man who was older than 18 and that
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
was a difficult issue for our family but
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
in the end with cons consultation
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
between both parties and both families
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
um there was a marriage which has last
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh because we just enveloped the man and
 
00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:32.799 align:start position:0%
his family into our family and it's been
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
that way ever
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
since I just want to say that I'm I'm
 
00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:39.799 align:start position:0%
supporting this amendment because it
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
offers an
 
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:45.160 align:start position:0%
exception and it is not a rule that a
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
minor would be allowed to marry a person
 
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
who is going for emancipation has to
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
make a strong case for emancipation and
 
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
I believe that that gives enough
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
Safeguard to
 
00:52:06.789 --> 00:52:06.799 align:start position:0%
protect marriage but also to allow that
 
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
option in cases where that would be a
 
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
good solution I urge you to support this
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
amendment does the member yield the
 
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
questions I yield representative leakage
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker thank you for
 
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question would you believe
 
00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:34.799 align:start position:0%
that I was 16 and Priscilla was just
 
00:52:34.799 --> 00:52:35.789 align:start position:0%
that I was 16 and Priscilla was just
barely

00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
barely
 
00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:38.799 align:start position:0%
17 when we got married and uh it's
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
almost 53 years ago and we didn't need
 
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
any outside input from anyone we've been
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
married almost 53 years would you
 
00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:51.990 align:start position:0%

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
that yes representative I would believe
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
that and I would probably attribute that
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
to the good character and worth of the
 
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
woman you married does a

inquire uh thank you Mr Speaker and

thank you for taking my question um do
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
you do you agree with the point of view
 
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
that uh if we continually restrict the
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
freedom of marriage as a legitimate
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
social option um when we do this to
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
people who are of a fertile ripe fertile
 
00:53:34.109 --> 00:53:34.119 align:start position:0%
age and may have may have a pregnancy
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
and a baby involved are we not in fact
 
00:53:41.309 --> 00:53:41.319 align:start position:0%
making abortion a much more desirable
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
alternative when marriage might be the
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
couple thank you representative and I
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%

in the that in some cases this offers
 
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
protection help and support for what's
 
00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:03.799 align:start position:0%

1700h are you ready for the question
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
oh yeah's
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
speaking my mistake CH recognized
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
GRE thank you Mr Speaker I think we all
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
can agree that marriage is an emotional
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
lifetime commitment based on love not a
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
solution to an unintended
 
00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
pregnancy we should not be putting
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
children in a position to be taken
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
advantage of by unsavory adults
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
and I'll stand by my remarks earlier the
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
bottom line is this children should not
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
be getting married period there should
 
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:13.960 align:start position:0%

child marriage as a human rights

not be taken the stance that is in some
 
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:start position:0%

00:58:51.309 --> 00:58:51.319 align:start position:0%
motion of a to pass on Senate Bill
 
00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
Speaker so I have a problem with a rule
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
with no
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
exceptions and I believe that I I have
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
had enough personal experience to know
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
that sometimes
 
00:59:40.029 --> 00:59:40.039 align:start position:0%
exceptions can be life-changing in a
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
good way and I am afraid that with
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
passing this bill without exceptions
 
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
allowing for minors under the age of 18
 
00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:51.710 align:start position:0%
allowing for minors under the age of 18
to

00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
marry this bill is
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
I would vote against this bill I do not
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
support it and I'm I believe that I
 
01:00:07.029 --> 01:00:07.039 align:start position:0%
have the personal experience to justify
 
01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
that but I also realized that young
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
people need some support sometimes it's
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
given by their family sometimes it's
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
given by marriage sometimes it's given
 
01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
by both I think that they need to have
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
those options open when they make a
 
01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
lifechanging decision so I ask you to
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
please defeat this bill so that we can
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
work on this another time thank you Mr
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
member yielder
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
questions yes I yield sen Roy your May
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
questions under this bill um does it
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
allow for any exception at all for and
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
this is what I'm concerned about we we
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
do have teen pregnancy and we do have
 
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
people that are together in
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
relationships for person who who may be
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
in the military to marry a pregnant
 
01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
teenager who may be a year younger and
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
he's getting shipped overseas or she's
 
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
getting sipped overseas to be able to
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
access the benefits from the military
 
01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
the health benefits um and God forbid
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
something happens to him that she's
 
01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:15.799 align:start position:0%
taken care of for the rest of her life
 
01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:17.559 align:start position:0%
from those benefits so she's not alone
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
them thank you for the question and I I
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're asking I do
 
01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:26.359 align:start position:0%
believe that there is some provision in
 
01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
the military to do that but what happens
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
is you rob someone of a life changing
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
experience of marriage and def
 
01:01:41.309 --> 01:01:41.319 align:start position:0%
definition if you do not let uh people
 
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
marry before the
 
01:01:45.309 --> 01:01:45.319 align:start position:0%
military yeah so there is there is no
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
exception for that and I believe that if
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
you're old enough to go and Fight for
 
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
Your Country you're old enough to
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
understand what the ramifications of
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
that are and you also know that you need
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
to get married and if you want to do
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
that I believe that they should be able
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:12.440 align:start position:0%

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
too broad and could go any

01:11:15.149 --> 01:11:15.159 align:start position:0%

01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
state the bottom line is that our
 
01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
country has already tried this approach
 
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
for decades through the War on Drugs
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimums used by federal
 
01:26:23.550 --> 01:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
government and states to try to
 
01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:24.870 align:start position:0%
government and states to try to
incarcerate

01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
incarcerate
 
01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
our way out of the drug problem plaguing
 
01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:28.910 align:start position:0%
our way out of the drug problem plaguing
our

01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:26:32.189 --> 01:26:32.199 align:start position:0%
communities and that approach failed our
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
country it was overly simplistic and
 
01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
extremely costly to the taxpayer and our
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
communities and it has done nothing to
 
01:26:47.790 --> 01:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
reduce drug use sales overdoses or
 
01:26:51.149 --> 01:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
deaths multip multiple studies over the
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
past four decades have demonstrated that
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum has not worked they do
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
not reduce drug use they do nothing to
 
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
Impact Drug sales or crime and they may
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
increase crime rates as they saw in
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
Florida with 50% rise in crimes after
 
01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
instituting mandatory
 
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
minimums and it was the taxpayers left
 
01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:19.719 align:start position:0%
holding the bill for excessive
 
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
incarceration with Rising prison and
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
jail populations with no reduction in
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
drug use sales or crimes to show for
 
01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
it beyond the Practical implication
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
there are basic constitutional
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
principles at stake here mandatory
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
minimum sentence defeat the purpose of
 
01:27:42.189 --> 01:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
sentencing by taking discretion away
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
from the judges and giving it to
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
prosecutors who use the threat of these
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
lengthy punishments to frustrate
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
defendants asserting their
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights this shift imp
 
01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:56.920 align:start position:0%

advisor to George HW Bush Administration

has stated the following my opposition
 
01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
to mandatory minimums is rooted in a
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
conservative principle namely reverence
 
01:28:19.229 --> 01:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
for the Constitution and contempt for
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
government action that ignores the

difference amongst individuals James

Madison for one believed that a clear
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
separation of powers was more vital to
 
01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
protecting freedom than the Bill of
 
01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
Rights yet mandatory minimum undermined
 
01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
the important protector of Liberty the
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
attempt by legislators and the Congress
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
to address perceived problems in the
 
01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
justice system by transferring power
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
from judges to prosecutors and the
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
executive branch violate their
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%

prosecutors

01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
prosecutors
 
01:28:59.709 --> 01:28:59.719 align:start position:0%
unreviewable authority to influence
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
sentences through their charging
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
decisions and ple bogging power and that
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
is what he
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
said as a result in this problematic
 
01:29:13.229 --> 01:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
shift in power so well described by
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
David King the mandatory minimum
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
sentencing robs judges of their ability
 
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
to fully consider all relevant facts and
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
circumstan anwers for sentencing such as
 
01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
the nature and context of particular
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
crime or the individual's crime
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
record this is why New Hampshire
 
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
currently has few mandatory minimums and
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
why the New Hampshire legislature has
 
01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
consistently worked to remove mandatory
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
minimums from our statutes over the last
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
Des decade this is also why Advocates
 
01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
from across the political Spectrum have
 
01:29:57.149 --> 01:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
opposed SP
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
316 finally adding insult to injury
 
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
sb316 adds a new Clause expanding asset
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
forfeiture authority of the police the
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
house has been working for years to
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
reform and narrow the asset forfeiture
 
01:30:17.229 --> 01:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
policy authority of law enforcement due
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
to fear of lack of due process and
 
01:30:23.470 --> 01:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
unfair deprivation of property now is
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
not the time time to expand the
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
government's asset forfeiture
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
Authority given what we know today about
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
the impact of mandatory minimum
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
sentences the question of what to do
 
01:30:39.229 --> 01:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
with SP 316 should not be a difficult
 
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
one I am asking the body to reject the
 
01:30:45.149 --> 01:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
return to an outdated policy that's
 
01:30:49.229 --> 01:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
proven expensive and ineffective at comb
 
01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
combating drug use sales deaths and that
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
undermines basic principles of
 
01:30:58.990 --> 01:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
Justice I urge you to vote red on the
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
art to pass a motion so another
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate motion of can be made thank
 
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker and I request a division
 
01:31:12.189 --> 01:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
vote chair recognized representative
 
01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
Roy thank you Mr
 
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker that's a lot to unpack all right
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
so mandatory minimums first of all
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
they're not unconstitutional they've
 
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
been around for a while we have some
 
01:31:25.229 --> 01:31:25.239 align:start position:0%
here generally speaking speaking as a as
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
a process for criminal justice I'm not
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
in favor of broad mandatory minimums
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
either um they were used broadly during
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
the 80s and early 90s during the crack
 
01:31:40.109 --> 01:31:40.119 align:start position:0%
epidemic um same thing with the three
 
01:31:40.119 --> 01:31:41.189 align:start position:0%
epidemic um same thing with the three
strikes

01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
strikes
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
rules it's not that they weren't
 
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
effective it's that broadly implemented
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
they they sent A lot of people to prison
 
01:31:50.109 --> 01:31:50.119 align:start position:0%
who probably didn't need to
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
go that being
 
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
said when you strategically they can
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
have a very good def deter effect we had
 
01:32:00.669 --> 01:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
a a gentleman here from Manchester a
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
former convicted um drug dealer who did
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
federal time during our bail
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
hearings and he was part of the input we
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
took from everyone and we asked him you
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
know what what do you think would would
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
be better deter this um and we were
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
talking about you know people getting
 
01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
out on bail and being arrested and he
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
said I quote if you want to stop this
 
01:32:24.669 --> 01:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
fentel problem
 
01:32:27.149 --> 01:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
you need to bring back mandatory
 
01:32:30.189 --> 01:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
minimums he said I'm from New York and
 
01:32:32.109 --> 01:32:32.119 align:start position:0%
back when that was mandatory minimum
 
01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
people refused to come to New Hampshire
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
because they knew we would have to go to
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
jail so we would go to Massachusetts
 
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
once you got rid of those now we moved
 
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
up the drugs are coming from L and
 
01:32:47.709 --> 01:32:47.719 align:start position:0%
Lawrence we know that there's no
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
deterrent the deterrent would be if you
 
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
want to bring these drugs to New
 
01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that they can poison our
 
01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:54.629 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that they can poison our
children

01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:32:56.350 --> 01:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
and you're caught you're going to jail
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
for 5 years so that's a decision you can
 
01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
weigh for yourself when you get in your
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
car speaking of car the part about the
 
01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
um asset forfeiture that was what we
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
were going to recommit for but the
 
01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:09.830 align:start position:0%
were going to recommit for but the
question

01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
was whether it's after conviction or
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
before conviction it's my reading of the
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill that it would be after because you
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
have to be convicted of actually
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
transporting to lose the
 
01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle um interesting thing about the
 
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
Vehicles they use to transport these
 
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
they spend sometimes tens of thousands
 
01:33:30.990 --> 01:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
of dollars to have these vehicles fitted
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
so you have to like turn on your
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
windshield wiper put on your right
 
01:33:37.629 --> 01:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
blinker and tune the radio to 92.4 FM so
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
a hide opens up where all the drugs are
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
hidden it's not just you know the family
 
01:33:43.629 --> 01:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
vehicle they're
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
using that being said we've with the
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
with regard to the expense I've heard
 
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
numbers around 56 something a thousand a
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
year to incarcerate somebody it costs
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
well over $100,000 a year to have
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
someone in and out of rehab a couple
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
times and the associated medical bills
 
01:34:04.109 --> 01:34:04.119 align:start position:0%
much more than the cost of
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
incarceration but that being said we're
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
targeting here not the user Who We R we
 
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
spend Millions every year to help people
 
01:34:14.070 --> 01:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
who are addicted to these
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
drugs but at the same time we can't just
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
keep treating the symptom we have to
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
treat the underlying cause so we
 
01:34:24.030 --> 01:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
continue and we should continue helping
 
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
people who are addicted to drugs but at
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
some point we have to take steps to stop
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
the poison from coming in in the first
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
place otherwise we'll just keep pouring
 
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
more money more money and digging more
 
01:34:40.109 --> 01:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
Graves and more Graves now it is true
 
01:34:42.629 --> 01:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
that deaths have gone down but that's
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
only because we have sent more Naran out
 
01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
into the society so people are being
 
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
brought back so they can overdose again
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
the drug epidemic has not gone away
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
people are still being addicted they're
 
01:34:59.470 --> 01:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
still overdosing in record numbers
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
they're just more of them surviving the
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
overdose so it's true these were tried
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
before and in my opinion and studies and
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
the numbers show they did stop the crack
 
01:35:13.229 --> 01:35:13.239 align:start position:0%
epidemic Unfortunately they caught up a
 
01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
lot of people that they shouldn't have
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
because it those minimum mandatories
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
were much much broader if you got caught
 
01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
with any amount of a drug you could be
 
01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
sented for for years years this is
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
simply anyone caught coming over our
 
01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
border with the intent to poison our
 
01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
children would have to make a choice
 
01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
when they decided to take that ride is
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
it worth five years of your life to come
 
01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
up here and poison our children if you
 
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
decide to take that risk that's on you
 
01:35:44.910 --> 01:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
no one made you do it so I would
 
01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
encourage you to think about that how
 
01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
much money we spend on everything risk
 
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
reward do we want to put some type of
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
penalty to deter these people from doing
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%

you

01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues Mr Speaker if I know that
 
01:37:49.629 --> 01:37:49.639 align:start position:0%
multiple studies over the last four
 
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
Decades of our failed War on Drugs show
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
that mandatory minimum penalty do
 
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
nothing to reduce crime drug sales drug
 
01:37:59.950 --> 01:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
arrests or overdose rates and if I know
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
that long mandatory prison sentences
 
01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:05.159 align:start position:0%
increase both the cost of incarceration
 
01:38:07.229 --> 01:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
and the chances of reism once the
 
01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
offender has been released and if I know
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
our current statute gives judges
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
discretion to sentence offenders for
 
01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
this crime to up to 30 years in prison
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
for transporting drugs with intent to
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
distribute and they often do and finally
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
if I know that our state does not have a
 
01:38:27.629 --> 01:38:27.639 align:start position:0%
Judicial discretion program uh problem
 
01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:30.159 align:start position:0%
but that it does have a fenel problem
 
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
that requires thoughtful evidence-based
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
policy solutions for the 2020s rather
 
01:38:37.709 --> 01:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
than failed policy solutions from the
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
1980s then would I press the red button
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
so another motion can be made thank you

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
if I know that New Hampshire needs to

address the C cause of a person's
 
01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%

01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
passing this spill we will be addressing

this issue from all
 
01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
angles and if I know there is no better
 
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
example of unfair deprivation than a
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
loved one grieving a family member that
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
is dead and Mr Speaker if I know the
 
01:39:13.109 --> 01:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
excuse of the price of incarceration is
 
01:39:15.629 --> 01:39:15.639 align:start position:0%
irrelevant considering you can't com you
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
can't put a price on a person's life
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
would I now press green with the

rhs thank you Mr
 
01:41:41.070 --> 01:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker at first glance this
 
01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
study committee does seem like it would
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
be a really good
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
idea they want to use pel grants and
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
they want to use funding from the let me
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
see what it is the Alliance Group to
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
further educate at people while they're
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
in prison and we did learn in the
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
committee that there are educational
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
opportunities available and there are
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
many people that are incarcerated to
 
01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the opportunities that
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
are available but as we took a deeper
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
dive into this I started asking some
 
01:42:08.639 --> 01:42:10.109 align:start position:0%
dive into this I started asking some
questions

01:42:10.109 --> 01:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:42:13.149 --> 01:42:13.159 align:start position:0%
and I asked about would it matter how
 
01:42:15.950 --> 01:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
long a person's incarceration was and I
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
was told no it wouldn't matter so if a
 
01:42:20.430 --> 01:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
person is serving a life
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
sentence same rules would apply however
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
they also said well we would probably
 
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
put them further down on the list so
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
they're kind of building this airplane
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
while we're trying to fly it the other
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
thing we have to consider
 
01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
is what happens whenever this money runs
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
out so is a person I consider to be a
 
01:42:40.149 --> 01:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
friend that's in our committee actually
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
said and I don't mean to pick on her but
 
01:42:43.629 --> 01:42:43.639 align:start position:0%
you know I'm going to have to here she
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
said well it's not going to cost us
 
01:42:47.550 --> 01:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
anything it's free money from the
 
01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
government all right there you have it
 
01:42:54.589 --> 01:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
so additionally
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's very good Steward of
 
01:42:58.990 --> 01:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
our tax dollars so when you make this
 
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
decision think about this do you really
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
want to pay for Adam Montgomery to get a
 
01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
college education I know that I don't
 
01:43:16.589 --> 01:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
constituents chair recognized
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker hello my distinguished
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
colleagues the bill before us today is a
 
01:43:39.149 --> 01:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
fairly straightforward proposal SP 376
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
seeks to establish a Planning Group
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
composed of relevant stakeholders and
 
01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
experts for the purpose of determining
 
01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
the best uh possible method of
 
01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:51.719 align:start position:0%
facilitating successful reintegration
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
into society through educational
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
programs for incarcerated
 
01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
individuals there are federal funds
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
available to cover this uh expense
 
01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
incarcerated individuals have access to
 
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
many of the same financing mechanis
 
01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that those of us on the
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
outside do largely pel grants that are
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
granted to the individual by the federal
 
01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
government so we are not asking for
 
01:44:18.510 --> 01:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
funding nor are we asking for the
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
educational programs themselves in this
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
bill we are simply asking in seeking to
 
01:44:27.149 --> 01:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
convene a group to consider all the
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
relevant factors that would lead to the
 
01:44:31.589 --> 01:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
best outcome for those incarcerated and
 
01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
for Society at large the research is
 
01:44:36.669 --> 01:44:36.679 align:start position:0%
very clear those incarcerated
 
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who re-enter Society with
 
01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
vocational opportunities are much less
 
01:44:44.109 --> 01:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
likely to reoffend with proper planning
 
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
and careful implementation we can reduce
 
01:44:49.629 --> 01:44:49.639 align:start position:0%
recidivism increase Public Safety and
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
save the taxpayers a pretty penny while
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
we're at it fun fundamentally we are
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
asking you to facilitate good
 
01:44:58.830 --> 01:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
stewardship of the resources at our
 
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
disposal I would hope that this body
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
could agree that thoughtful
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
consideration and planning uh is in all
 
01:45:06.910 --> 01:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
of our best interest and please join me

funding free education for the
 
01:47:06.270 --> 01:47:06.280 align:start position:0%

01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
incarceration should not be a pathway to
 
01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
a free college education would I now
 
01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:18.360 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
goal of our correction system isn't to
 
01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:36.159 align:start position:0%
create better criminals but to create
 
01:47:38.229 --> 01:47:38.239 align:start position:0%
better citizens who upon their release
 
01:47:40.589 --> 01:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
are committed to being crime-free and
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
capable of being
 
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
self-supporting and if I know New
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses facing labor
 
01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
shortages are looking at apprenticeships
 
01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
and work experiences for incarcerated
 
01:47:52.990 --> 01:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
persons and there are emerging synergies
 
01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
between uh what employers are looking
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
for and the coursework that's offered by
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
our community college system and finally
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
if I know that incarcerated individuals
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
who participate in educational
 
01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
programming are 48% less likely to
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
return to prison within 3 years of
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%

02:03:18.189 --> 02:03:18.199 align:start position:0%
administrators and well-paid teachers
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
they have that option and choice but in
 
02:03:23.470 --> 02:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the real ity for many is
 
02:03:25.709 --> 02:03:25.719 align:start position:0%
that property poor communities do not
 
02:03:28.510 --> 02:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
have that option if this bill is
 
02:03:30.750 --> 02:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
submitted because a person couldn't find
 
02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
local information then why not seek to
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
ask local
 
02:03:38.189 --> 02:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
governance if the information SS
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
difficult to find then that's a local
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
issue local control means towns cities
 
02:03:46.109 --> 02:03:46.119 align:start position:0%
and school districts make decisions
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
locally including following all parts of
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
the municipal budget law in RSA 198 cone
 
02:03:58.629 --> 02:03:58.639 align:start position:0%
4-g civil re remedies are sought with
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
this bill what does that mean if I can't
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
find a report on local school
 
02:04:05.790 --> 02:04:05.800 align:start position:0%
expenditures I can file a
 
02:04:09.549 --> 02:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and that I'm owed relief that a
 
02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
school district will incur additional
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
legal expenditures and have to increase
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
their school
 
02:04:18.430 --> 02:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
budgets please vote no on OTP so that
 
02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%

Noble thank you Mr
 
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
Speaker colleagues over the last two
 
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
decades our cost per pupil in New
 
02:04:38.350 --> 02:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has gone up
 
02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
77% when adjusted for
 
02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
inflation when looking at teacher
 
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
salaries there has been minimal increase
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
in comparison to the sharp rise in per
 
02:04:52.549 --> 02:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
pupil cost in fact according to reaching
 
02:04:55.229 --> 02:04:55.239 align:start position:0%
higher New Hampshire teachers are
 
02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
actually making 8% less than they were
 
02:04:58.400 --> 02:04:59.189 align:start position:0%
actually making 8% less than they were
in

02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
2019 when adjusted for
 
02:05:04.589 --> 02:05:04.599 align:start position:0%
inflation Massachusetts is spending
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
roughly the same amount as us at about
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
20,000 per student but somehow the
 
02:05:12.830 --> 02:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
average salary of a New Hampshire
 
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
teacher is almost 20,000 less than the
 
02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
average salary of a teacher in
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts if the data from m
 
02:05:23.790 --> 02:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts tells us anything it is
 
02:05:26.549 --> 02:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
that our teacher pay crisis has nothing
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
to do with our taxes and spending being
 
02:05:33.390 --> 02:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
too low over the past 20 years
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
non-teaching staff has gone up 80% and
 
02:05:39.870 --> 02:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
that growth in administration includes
 
02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:40.910 align:start position:0%
that growth in administration includes

Professionals in the same period we
 
02:05:49.510 --> 02:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
increased the number of teachers by
 
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
23% as of this year some administrators
 
02:05:55.990 --> 02:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
are making three times the average
 
02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
salary of a New Hampshire
 
02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
teacher these are just the facts if we
 
02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
want taxpayers to continue to invest in
 
02:06:07.310 --> 02:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
their local schools they need to know
 
02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
where that money is being spent and how
 
02:06:14.109 --> 02:06:14.119 align:start position:0%
that investment Trends over
 
02:06:16.830 --> 02:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
time this bill would provide that
 
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
transparency in a clear and accessible
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%

graphs and one
 
02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
table the line graphs will show average
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
cost per pupil average teacher salary
 
02:06:34.350 --> 02:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
and administrator
 
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:36.880 align:start position:0%

02:06:40.109 --> 02:06:40.119 align:start position:0%
previous 10 years the table will display
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
the top four administrator salaries and

titles the average taxpayer doesn't know
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
how to find this information they
 
02:06:52.669 --> 02:06:52.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to go digging on the

together just as you would get charts

and graphs for any personal fund that
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
you invest in taxpayers should be given
 
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
the data about their
 
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
investment this bill would ensure
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
transparency for all stakeholders to
 
02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:15.719 align:start position:0%

budget
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
process this is not a burden on our
 
02:07:21.709 --> 02:07:21.719 align:start position:0%
school districts they have all the the
 
02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
data and are more than capable of
 
02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
producing these three simple line graphs

Hampshire students as well as our
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
ability to retain teachers this bill
 
02:07:44.709 --> 02:07:44.719 align:start position:0%
would provide for transparency and help

our local communities to rep prioritize

Speaker if I know to paraphrase Mark
 
02:09:35.470 --> 02:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
Twain that there are lies darn lies and
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
statistics and this bill skewed D data
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%

02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
information is already available and
 
02:09:49.390 --> 02:09:49.400 align:start position:0%

publicly available by school districts
 
02:10:03.589 --> 02:10:03.599 align:start position:0%
already finally if I know that it is the
 
02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the locally elected
 
02:10:09.629 --> 02:10:09.639 align:start position:0%
school boards to respond to taxpayer
 
02:10:12.669 --> 02:10:12.679 align:start position:0%
concerns and these school board members
 
02:10:16.229 --> 02:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
can be voted out if taxpayers are
 
02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
dissatisfied with their

very interested in their salary as
 
02:10:58.709 --> 02:10:58.719 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Department of Education stated
 
02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
that the bill language in s SP 341 is
 
02:17:19.549 --> 02:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
unclear subjective and would be very
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to enforce and the office of
 
02:17:24.389 --> 02:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
the child advocate said the bill quote
 
02:17:26.709 --> 02:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
threatens the health safety and
 
02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
intrinsic rights of Granite State

violating their constitutional right to
 
02:17:46.230 --> 02:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
privacy and if I know that a basic
 
02:17:48.389 --> 02:17:48.399 align:start position:0%

believe that parents are the ultimate
 
02:18:10.990 --> 02:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
decision makers when it comes to their
 
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%

03:34:08.550 --> 03:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
committee find your
 
03:34:11.389 --> 03:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
seats please settle down so that we can
 
03:34:13.510 --> 03:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
hear the people who will be speaking
 
03:34:16.229 --> 03:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
right now representative vure is
 
03:34:19.229 --> 03:34:19.239 align:start position:0%
recognized speak against the committee
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr chair good afternoon
 
03:34:24.910 --> 03:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues it is my pleasure to get to
 
03:34:28.469 --> 03:34:28.479 align:start position:0%
speak to you immediately after
 
03:34:34.990 --> 03:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:37.110 --> 03:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
speaker now I would like you to keep in
 
03:34:39.670 --> 03:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
mind because the topic of this bill
 
03:34:42.269 --> 03:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
addresses the uh the definition of of a
 
03:34:44.269 --> 03:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
disabled person a Disabled Student in
 
03:34:46.189 --> 03:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
education so I I want you to keep in
 
03:34:47.750 --> 03:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
mind as I discussed that that as of
 
03:34:50.990 --> 03:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
right now more than 25% of New Hampshire
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
Public School students are recognized as
 
03:34:54.910 --> 03:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
disabled for purposes of either
 
03:34:57.469 --> 03:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
receiving accommodation or treatment or
 
03:34:57.479 --> 03:34:58.349 align:start position:0%
receiving accommodation or treatment or
an

03:34:58.349 --> 03:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
an
 
03:35:00.830 --> 03:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
IEP over one in
 
03:35:04.710 --> 03:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
four now what this bill would do is it
 
03:35:07.670 --> 03:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
significantly expands the definition of
 
03:35:10.590 --> 03:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
disability for uh especially young
 
03:35:15.910 --> 03:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:18.830 --> 03:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
now it expands it so far that there is
 
03:35:20.590 --> 03:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
no need to actually have a disability
 
03:35:23.030 --> 03:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
there is only the need to have a
 
03:35:28.429 --> 03:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:31.229 --> 03:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
disability okay so literally any child
 
03:35:32.550 --> 03:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
could theoretically be considered
 
03:35:34.349 --> 03:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
disabled under this definition resulting
 
03:35:36.790 --> 03:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
in a possible expansion of this
 
03:35:39.670 --> 03:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
definition to who knows how many
 
03:35:41.870 --> 03:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
children in this environment another
 
03:35:44.510 --> 03:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
thing it does is it makes it unnecessary
 
03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
to have any formal diag diagnosis for
 
03:35:46.239 --> 03:35:47.790 align:start position:0%
to have any formal diag diagnosis for
the

03:35:47.790 --> 03:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:35:50.510 --> 03:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
child no formal diagnosis
 
03:35:52.870 --> 03:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
required so what this is actually doing
 
03:35:55.030 --> 03:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
is it's placing the diagnosing and
 
03:35:57.469 --> 03:35:57.479 align:start position:0%
treatment and IEP and all of that stuff
 
03:35:58.750 --> 03:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
it's taking that away from the
 
03:36:01.790 --> 03:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
professional clinicians the Physicians
 
03:36:09.670 --> 03:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:12.229 --> 03:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
instead now these are pretty significant
 
03:36:14.870 --> 03:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
problems that exist in this bill and
 
03:36:17.389 --> 03:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
it's not just because it's what I've
 
03:36:19.710 --> 03:36:19.720 align:start position:0%
told you so far but also because in this
 
03:36:21.950 --> 03:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
particular program special education
 
03:36:23.150 --> 03:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
funds are
 
03:36:25.830 --> 03:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
limited and what that means is as you
 
03:36:27.309 --> 03:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
expand the number of children that are
 
03:36:29.150 --> 03:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
going to receive services to those who
 
03:36:31.229 --> 03:36:31.239 align:start position:0%
no don't have a diagnosis and may not
 
03:36:33.389 --> 03:36:33.399 align:start position:0%
need those Services you're actually
 
03:36:34.950 --> 03:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
taking those Services away from other
 
03:36:38.389 --> 03:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:42.030 --> 03:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
them last special education services are
 
03:36:44.189 --> 03:36:44.199 align:start position:0%
not in themselves necessarily
 
03:36:46.950 --> 03:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
harmless inter interventions treatments
 
03:36:48.870 --> 03:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
and accommodations introduce something
 
03:36:48.880 --> 03:36:49.870 align:start position:0%
and accommodations introduce something
called

03:36:49.870 --> 03:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
called
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
iatrogenesis in patients and children
 
03:36:55.189 --> 03:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
who do not have a developmental disorder
 
03:36:58.349 --> 03:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
who not have a problem it will actually
 
03:37:00.910 --> 03:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
it has a chance of setting them on a
 
03:37:03.229 --> 03:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
very bad path down a road to
 
03:37:05.670 --> 03:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
medicalization and otherwise worse
 
03:37:07.950 --> 03:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
outcomes now we heard that there may be
 
03:37:09.750 --> 03:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
an issue that exists when it comes to
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
daycare services when it comes to
 
03:37:13.870 --> 03:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
funding and whether or not certain
 
03:37:15.830 --> 03:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
students are able to get them that's
 
03:37:18.670 --> 03:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
possible it is possible we didn't get to
 
03:37:21.269 --> 03:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
nail that down in committee though and
 
03:37:22.990 --> 03:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
if that is a real thing and it needs to
 
03:37:25.150 --> 03:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
First be established that it is a real
 
03:37:28.150 --> 03:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
thing then this needs to be far more
 
03:37:31.950 --> 03:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored to meet the actual
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
needs of those students that have the
 
03:37:36.750 --> 03:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
needs as it stands uh this is unworkable
 
03:37:38.469 --> 03:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
so I would ask you to vote against the
 
03:37:40.150 --> 03:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
OTP motion that another motion can be
 
03:37:41.910 --> 03:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
made thank
 
03:37:44.429 --> 03:37:44.439 align:start position:0%
you representative Damon recognized to
 
03:37:50.950 --> 03:37:50.960 align:start position:0%

it thank you Mr Speaker good afternoon

colleagues I hope everybody enjoyed
 
03:38:01.110 --> 03:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
lunch SB 596 is a strongly bipartisan
 
03:38:03.349 --> 03:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
bill that addresses the problem of
 
03:38:05.830 --> 03:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
affordable child care for high need
 
03:38:08.349 --> 03:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
children who do not yet have a formal
 
03:38:11.150 --> 03:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
disability diagnosis but require more
 
03:38:14.269 --> 03:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
Staffing to meet their needs it is well
 
03:38:15.870 --> 03:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
known that New Hampshire fath es a
 
03:38:18.349 --> 03:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
critical shortage of child care this
 
03:38:21.150 --> 03:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
shortage has extensive adverse effects
 
03:38:23.750 --> 03:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
on our businesses who need parents as
 
03:38:26.030 --> 03:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
employees and on the economics of
 
03:38:28.429 --> 03:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
hardworking families who need affordable
 
03:38:30.990 --> 03:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
reliable child care that is appropriate
 
03:38:33.670 --> 03:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
to their child's needs New Hampshire
 
03:38:35.830 --> 03:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
Child Care Centers lack the resources to
 
03:38:38.309 --> 03:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
provide dedicated staff for children
 
03:38:39.950 --> 03:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
with additional developmental and
 
03:38:43.110 --> 03:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
behavioral needs because of this many
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
centers have been forced to enroll fewer
 
03:38:47.110 --> 03:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
children children in classrooms with
 
03:38:49.910 --> 03:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
high needs children thus exacerbating
 
03:38:52.510 --> 03:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
the overall Child Care availability
 
03:38:55.229 --> 03:38:55.239 align:start position:0%
crisis under the existing New Hampshire
 
03:38:57.469 --> 03:38:57.479 align:start position:0%
Child Care scholarship program

are only available to children with

motion thank you Mr
 
03:50:56.030 --> 03:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker I am here to speak against the
 
03:51:00.630 --> 03:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
OTP on sb380 again to speak against this
 
03:51:04.389 --> 03:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
bill in January just a few months ago we
 
03:51:08.870 --> 03:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
and this house voted 281 to 82 to move
 
03:51:11.389 --> 03:51:11.399 align:start position:0%
the primary to the third Tuesday in
 
03:51:15.750 --> 03:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
August that's a 70% vote vot it is
 
03:51:17.349 --> 03:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
sitting in the other
 
03:51:19.950 --> 03:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
chamber now we have a bill to move the
 
03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
primary to June the second Tuesday in
 
03:51:25.469 --> 03:51:25.479 align:start position:0%
June during the busiest time of the
 
03:51:28.309 --> 03:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
school year remember most elections are
 
03:51:31.269 --> 03:51:31.279 align:start position:0%
done in schools and the filing period
 
03:51:33.990 --> 03:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
for this bill takes place in March the
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
first Wednesday Friday the week after in
 
03:51:39.469 --> 03:51:39.479 align:start position:0%
the middle of this filing period a town
 
03:51:42.590 --> 03:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
and School District
 
03:51:45.189 --> 03:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
elections the town clerk is busy with
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
these elections and at the polls and
 
03:51:51.950 --> 03:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
then have to do state filings the
 
03:51:54.149 --> 03:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
secretary state is also busy with State
 
03:51:56.469 --> 03:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
and County filings I guess the sponsor
 
03:51:59.189 --> 03:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
of this bill didn't realize that and why
 
03:52:01.630 --> 03:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
do you think that City elections are
 
03:52:04.269 --> 03:52:04.279 align:start position:0%
done in the odd year so not having the
 
03:52:07.349 --> 03:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
interference of State elections now we
 
03:52:09.710 --> 03:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
are asked to vote for a bill that
 
03:52:12.950 --> 03:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
interferes with Town elections and for
 
03:52:15.070 --> 03:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
towns that have elections in
 
03:52:18.269 --> 03:52:18.279 align:start position:0%
April that will be the most interference
 
03:52:20.830 --> 03:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
how can people running for local office
 
03:52:22.469 --> 03:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
Town Council budget committee
 
03:52:24.910 --> 03:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard Etc compete with people
 
03:52:27.710 --> 03:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
running for state county and federal
 
03:52:30.670 --> 03:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
office how many campaign signs for local
 
03:52:33.590 --> 03:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
office be overrun by sign for state
 
03:52:36.349 --> 03:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
federal and county offices they won't be
 
03:52:39.429 --> 03:52:39.439 align:start position:0%
seen for example Barac has State eight
 
03:52:42.910 --> 03:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
State grips so that's more than eight
 
03:52:46.389 --> 03:52:46.399 align:start position:0%
signs because it'd be Bor than double I
 
03:52:48.910 --> 03:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
guess this wasn't thought of either
 
03:52:52.070 --> 03:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
again we voted by 70% to have the
 
03:52:54.670 --> 03:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
primary in August which is also
 
03:52:57.229 --> 03:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
recommended by the Secretary of State
 
03:52:59.309 --> 03:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
and that number is enough to override
 
03:53:02.630 --> 03:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
any veto this bill should be lawed now
 
03:53:04.990 --> 03:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
but the other body has refused to vote
 
03:53:08.510 --> 03:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
for it I was elected by the people in my
 
03:53:11.790 --> 03:53:11.800 align:start position:0%
town to represent them and the people of
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we were not elected to be
 
03:53:17.910 --> 03:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
puppets of some National
 
03:53:21.670 --> 03:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
Organization represent B puppet was just
 
03:53:25.990 --> 03:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
a step too far you may continue say good
 
03:53:29.830 --> 03:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
puppets that was a little too far okay
 
03:53:33.110 --> 03:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
apologize and Mr Speaker I ask for a
 
03:53:36.309 --> 03:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
division vote and also ask that we not
 
03:53:39.349 --> 03:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
second any motion for a roll call we do
 
03:53:42.349 --> 03:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
not need any more reprisals for people
 
03:53:44.710 --> 03:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
voting what is best for the state so
 
03:53:47.950 --> 03:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
please join me by voting red so a proper
 
03:53:50.349 --> 03:53:50.359 align:start position:0%
motion can be made we remember again we
 
03:53:53.750 --> 03:53:53.760 align:start position:0%

these days somebody's going to have to
 
03:54:15.670 --> 03:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
tell me why election law is always the
 
03:54:18.189 --> 03:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
bill for print remarks and pulling
 
03:54:20.469 --> 03:54:20.479 align:start position:0%
things off the table but um that's just
 
03:54:21.990 --> 03:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
my it's just a grievance I've wanted to
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
get off my chest for some time maybe
 
03:54:26.550 --> 03:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
it's because we're always after lunch um
 
03:54:29.870 --> 03:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
this bill moves the state primary to
 
03:54:32.590 --> 03:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
June um little history on this I have
 
03:54:35.149 --> 03:54:35.159 align:start position:0%
voted for August I have voted for June I
 
03:54:37.349 --> 03:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
bet you if I pulled this entire room and
 
03:54:39.630 --> 03:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
I said hey do you like a 45-day general
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
election window in September I would
 
03:54:43.790 --> 03:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
venture to say 80% of you would agree
 
03:54:46.110 --> 03:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
with me that September is horrible we
 
03:54:47.990 --> 03:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
just can't seem to agree on what's
 
03:54:50.429 --> 03:54:50.439 align:start position:0%
better August or June um I am of the
 
03:54:52.990 --> 03:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
mentality of please God move it please
 
03:54:55.229 --> 03:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
God move it I have voted for both of
 
03:54:57.870 --> 03:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
them here's the political reality the
 
03:55:00.429 --> 03:55:00.439 align:start position:0%
political reality is that August meets a
 
03:55:03.590 --> 03:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
veto pen it just is once again I voted
 
03:55:06.990 --> 03:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
for August this body a last term voted
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
for June the Senate is going to send us
 
03:55:13.950 --> 03:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
back June it's June if you want to end
 
03:55:17.790 --> 03:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
this Madness this 45 Day Madness you
 
03:55:20.590 --> 03:55:20.600 align:start position:0%
have to vote for June trust me I
 
03:55:22.750 --> 03:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind August once again I have
 
03:55:26.030 --> 03:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
voted for it you can always find an
 
03:55:29.590 --> 03:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
excuse not to do something there is no
 
03:55:31.670 --> 03:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
ideal place to put this where it doesn't
 
03:55:34.790 --> 03:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
step on something it just is June I
 
03:55:36.189 --> 03:55:36.199 align:start position:0%
think June's great it's going be right
 
03:55:38.030 --> 03:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of school we'll be able to a
 
03:55:39.309 --> 03:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
lot of place will'll be able to use the
 
03:55:41.630 --> 03:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
schools but right now what we have is
 
03:55:43.229 --> 03:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
what's referred to as the incumbent
 
03:55:45.590 --> 03:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
protection plan I've talked about it in
 
03:55:48.189 --> 03:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
this body for a long time I know I'm
 
03:55:49.790 --> 03:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
talking to a room full of incumbents
 
03:55:51.469 --> 03:55:51.479 align:start position:0%
saying hey you should give up your
 
03:55:53.510 --> 03:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
incumbent protection but that is what's
 
03:55:55.630 --> 03:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
best for the state that is what's best
 
03:55:58.389 --> 03:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
for the state voters deserve to hear
 
03:56:02.269 --> 03:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
from both candidates we need to unrig
 
03:56:16.429 --> 03:56:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:22.830 --> 03:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:25.469 --> 03:56:25.479 align:start position:0%
question the questions on
 
03:56:28.149 --> 03:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
the motion about to pass on Senate Bill
 
03:56:30.149 --> 03:56:30.159 align:start position:0%
380 representative Lane request a
 
03:56:31.790 --> 03:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
division vote this will be a division
 
03:56:43.229 --> 03:56:43.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:22.469 --> 03:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:24.149 --> 03:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
all right the motion is out to pass on
 
03:57:26.389 --> 03:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 380 and this is a division
 
03:57:28.349 --> 03:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
vote representative Brennan's recognized
 
03:57:31.590 --> 03:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:34.790 --> 03:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
03:57:37.710 --> 03:57:37.720 align:start position:0%
if I know the majority of municipalities
 
03:57:41.189 --> 03:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire operate under the much
 
03:57:43.750 --> 03:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
celebrated traditional town meeting form
 
03:57:45.750 --> 03:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
of govern government and the majority of
 
03:57:47.870 --> 03:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
towns hold their town meeting elections
 
03:57:50.990 --> 03:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
in March with the filing period in
 
03:57:53.830 --> 03:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
January and if I know that this bill
 
03:57:56.110 --> 03:57:56.120 align:start position:0%
would move the primary to June which
 
03:57:58.630 --> 03:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
would make the state election filing
 
03:58:01.710 --> 03:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
period move to
 
03:58:04.790 --> 03:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
March when this body is in the middle of
 
03:58:07.269 --> 03:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
its legislative
 
03:58:09.590 --> 03:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
work and if I know that moving the state
 
03:58:11.389 --> 03:58:11.399 align:start position:0%
primary to June does not take into
 
03:58:14.149 --> 03:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
account the real world impact on downb
 
03:58:17.590 --> 03:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
valot candidates like State
 
03:58:20.389 --> 03:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
reps and if I know the secretary of
 
03:58:23.189 --> 03:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
state is against this bill and concerns
 
03:58:25.229 --> 03:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
have been raised about recruiting
 
03:58:28.070 --> 03:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
election volunteers to work our safe
 
03:58:33.030 --> 03:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
secure and efficient elections all year

04:11:33.189 --> 04:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
already a conversation that we are
 
04:11:35.189 --> 04:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
having the discussion and the debate
 
04:11:37.670 --> 04:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
with the body on the other side why
 
04:11:40.950 --> 04:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
would we indefinitely postpone an active
 
04:11:43.389 --> 04:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
debate I know a thing or two about indef
 
04:11:45.910 --> 04:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
itely postponing legislation why would
 
04:11:49.070 --> 04:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
we indefinitely postpone a policy
 
04:11:51.670 --> 04:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
subject that is actively being debated
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
with the other side of the wall unless
 
04:11:57.149 --> 04:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
we are afraid to engage in that debate
 
04:11:59.990 --> 04:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
with them on a policy change between
 
04:12:03.109 --> 04:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
August and June member will suspend that
 
04:12:05.790 --> 04:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
was kind of motive speak there we don't
 
04:12:08.710 --> 04:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
allow that I apologize for my
 
04:12:11.109 --> 04:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
indiscretion but vote red against the
 
04:12:13.349 --> 04:12:13.359 align:start position:0%
indefinite postponement I would then go
 
04:12:15.229 --> 04:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
along with you on inexpedient to
 
04:12:17.790 --> 04:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
legislate this second week in June
 
04:12:20.030 --> 04:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
primary Bill and then we can allow the
 
04:12:22.910 --> 04:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
conversations with the other body to
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
much representative Weber's recognized
 
04:12:34.149 --> 04:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the motion I
 
04:12:37.189 --> 04:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
am thank you Mr
 
04:12:39.189 --> 04:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr
 
04:12:42.149 --> 04:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I have looked at the votes as
 
04:12:44.030 --> 04:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
we've gone through them and I won't list
 
04:12:48.710 --> 04:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
them again for you and if I
 
04:12:53.149 --> 04:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
believe that it would be better to
 
04:12:53.159 --> 04:12:54.670 align:start position:0%
believe that it would be better to
indefinitely

04:12:54.670 --> 04:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
indefinitely
 
04:12:57.429 --> 04:12:57.439 align:start position:0%
postpone because
 
04:13:00.349 --> 04:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise they that we should not
 
04:13:05.510 --> 04:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
mention might tack this bill which most
 
04:13:09.269 --> 04:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
of us don't seem to want to a bill that
 
04:13:13.309 --> 04:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
this body very much wants thus leaving
 
04:13:15.710 --> 04:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
us in a terrible quandry about which
 
04:13:18.630 --> 04:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
policy we're going to deal with would I
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
now vote
 
04:13:24.870 --> 04:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
red a green sorry green green
 
04:13:28.269 --> 04:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
green house will be in order would I now
 
04:13:34.910 --> 04:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:36.750 --> 04:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
postponement there have been so many
 
04:13:38.630 --> 04:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
useful parliamentary inquiries this term
 
04:13:39.990 --> 04:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
where the member really needed the
 
04:13:44.229 --> 04:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:46.229 --> 04:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
for what reason does the member
 
04:13:49.750 --> 04:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
rise question of the chair yeah would
 
04:13:51.510 --> 04:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
this motion have any effect on our
 
04:13:54.510 --> 04:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
ability to enroll a house bill that is
 
04:13:56.030 --> 04:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
currently with the body on the other
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:20.630 --> 04:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:27.030 --> 04:14:27.040 align:start position:0%

you
 
04:14:31.510 --> 04:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay the question is whether to
 
04:14:34.109 --> 04:14:34.119 align:start position:0%
indefinitely postpone Senate Bill 380
 
04:14:36.710 --> 04:14:36.720 align:start position:0%

Pockets thank you Mr Speaker I'm not
 
04:19:45.109 --> 04:19:45.119 align:start position:0%
sure how many of you have heard of cyto
 
04:19:47.910 --> 04:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
megala virus um we call it CMV because
 
04:19:49.950 --> 04:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
it's a lot easier to understand that
 
04:19:51.950 --> 04:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's actually a pretty common infection
 
04:19:54.030 --> 04:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
but if a woman gets it when she's
 
04:19:56.189 --> 04:19:56.199 align:start position:0%
pregnant and then passes it to her baby
 
04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
in some of the kids that are born with
 
04:20:00.389 --> 04:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
it it can have some pretty bad outcomes
 
04:20:03.309 --> 04:20:03.319 align:start position:0%
however those bad outcomes are primarily
 
04:20:04.990 --> 04:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
in those infants who are born with
 
04:20:08.590 --> 04:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
infant hearing loss because of CMV so if
 
04:20:10.750 --> 04:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
we were to take those kids who fail
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
their hearing test and then screen them
 
04:20:15.990 --> 04:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
for CMV we'd be able to give them well
 
04:20:17.469 --> 04:20:17.479 align:start position:0%
the doctors would be able to give them
 
04:20:19.510 --> 04:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
an antiviral that would reverse that
 
04:20:22.149 --> 04:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
hearing loss and also May re reverse
 
04:20:23.830 --> 04:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
some developmental disabilities that
 
04:20:26.030 --> 04:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
come with this infection that you they
 
04:20:28.349 --> 04:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
get um during this whole this whole
 
04:20:31.990 --> 04:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
process so this is a specific area to
 
04:20:34.269 --> 04:20:34.279 align:start position:0%
identify children who are at specific
 
04:20:36.510 --> 04:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
risk and there is an intervention that
 
04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
works to restore their hearing and give
 
04:20:41.670 --> 04:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
them a chance to um to have a life that
 
04:20:44.030 --> 04:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit easy year and deal
 
04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
with an infection early on as we were
 
04:20:48.070 --> 04:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with this in our committee and
 
04:20:49.469 --> 04:20:49.479 align:start position:0%
as they dealt with it initially in the
 
04:20:51.429 --> 04:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
other body it's pretty complex
 
04:20:53.149 --> 04:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
especially because the hearing test that
 
04:20:55.469 --> 04:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
we do for newborns isn't actually
 
04:20:57.790 --> 04:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
required um it's a voluntary one that
 
04:21:00.550 --> 04:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
most people do it's a really good idea
 
04:21:02.149 --> 04:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
because it's good to know if your baby
 
04:21:04.870 --> 04:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
can't hear so you can start intervention
 
04:21:07.070 --> 04:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
and looking into the process really the
 
04:21:10.510 --> 04:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
only way to make sure that doctors know
 
04:21:12.990 --> 04:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
about this CMB test or that that they
 
04:21:15.630 --> 04:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
know about the need to test for CMV if a
 
04:21:17.750 --> 04:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
baby has failed both hearing tests is
 
04:21:19.349 --> 04:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
just to put it on the form that they
 
04:21:21.070 --> 04:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
fill out if the hearing test is already
 
04:21:23.710 --> 04:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
happen doing that's why we have uh this
 
04:21:25.149 --> 04:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
nice little floor amendment that would
 
04:21:26.469 --> 04:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
direct them to change a current
 
04:21:28.710 --> 04:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
administrative rule um really this is
 
04:21:30.830 --> 04:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
the only way we could find to address
 
04:21:33.070 --> 04:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
this issue um this is moving on to
 
04:21:35.349 --> 04:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
another on to finance if we pass it
 
04:21:37.109 --> 04:21:37.119 align:start position:0%
today so if there's any further
 
04:21:38.830 --> 04:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
refinements I know it's not great to
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
work policy there but we can make
 
04:21:42.309 --> 04:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
refinements later um but I think that
 
04:21:44.790 --> 04:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
this is pretty key because of the 10 to
 
04:21:46.790 --> 04:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
15 kids that are born in New Hampshire
 
04:21:50.030 --> 04:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
with CMV related hearing loss each year
 
04:21:51.830 --> 04:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that those kids can
 
04:21:54.030 --> 04:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
be tested and can be treated while it's
 
04:21:56.189 --> 04:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
still reversible so with that I would
 
04:21:57.750 --> 04:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
ask for your support on this amendment
 
04:21:59.070 --> 04:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
and then on the bill with the amendment
 
04:22:03.349 --> 04:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:14.030 --> 04:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:16.030 --> 04:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the lay on
 
04:22:18.790 --> 04:22:18.800 align:start position:0%

04:23:43.349 --> 04:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
kofalt thank you Mr Speaker so
 
04:23:46.349 --> 04:23:46.359 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 403 is called relative to
 
04:23:48.229 --> 04:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
the Health Care
 
04:23:50.950 --> 04:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
Workforce it aims among other things to
 
04:23:54.070 --> 04:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
alleviate the workforce uh uh shortage
 
04:23:57.229 --> 04:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
in in in healthcare in New
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but one of the major
 
04:24:00.710 --> 04:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
provisions of the bill is that it
 
04:24:03.070 --> 04:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
creates something a a certification for
 
04:24:04.990 --> 04:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
something called a community health
 
04:24:07.269 --> 04:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
worker um now this position already
 
04:24:10.630 --> 04:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
exists in uh in a number of places but
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
there is no current certification by the
 
04:24:17.229 --> 04:24:17.239 align:start position:0%
state community health workers
 
04:24:20.750 --> 04:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as they currently exist
 
04:24:22.469 --> 04:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
overlap substantially with those of
 
04:24:26.670 --> 04:24:26.680 align:start position:0%
social workers case managers and skilled
 
04:24:26.680 --> 04:24:28.309 align:start position:0%
social workers case managers and skilled
nursing

04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
04:24:30.710 --> 04:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
staff there are a couple of major issues
 
04:24:32.429 --> 04:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
with this bill number one certification
 
04:24:32.439 --> 04:24:33.229 align:start position:0%
with this bill number one certification
is

04:24:33.229 --> 04:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
optional so let's say that you become a
 
04:24:38.830 --> 04:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
certified health work uh Community
 
04:24:38.840 --> 04:24:39.710 align:start position:0%
certified health work uh Community
Health

04:24:39.710 --> 04:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
Health
 
04:24:42.030 --> 04:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
worker and you get caught doing
 
04:24:43.990 --> 04:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
something thing you shouldn't be doing
 
04:24:46.710 --> 04:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
and you lose your certification for
 
04:24:49.389 --> 04:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
cause can you still be a community
 
04:24:52.750 --> 04:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
health worker the answer is
 
04:24:55.030 --> 04:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
yes why then would we create this
 
04:24:59.229 --> 04:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:59.239 --> 04:25:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
certification

04:25:02.070 --> 04:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
certification
 
04:25:04.429 --> 04:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
well I'm not sure what the answer is to
 
04:25:06.149 --> 04:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
that but I I will say that there's quite
 
04:25:09.149 --> 04:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of um quite a lot of money
 
04:25:10.309 --> 04:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
involved and there would be some
 
04:25:13.790 --> 04:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
additional State spending
 
04:25:16.630 --> 04:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
um the the fiscal note explains that
 
04:25:19.429 --> 04:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
this is uh will cost
 
04:25:21.469 --> 04:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
$4,650 in year
 
04:25:24.070 --> 04:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
one um if you look a little further down
 
04:25:27.309 --> 04:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
on the page you see 4.2
 
04:25:29.469 --> 04:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
million that's because this creates a
 
04:25:33.510 --> 04:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
broad new um entitlement under
 
04:25:35.910 --> 04:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and what we're really doing is
 
04:25:40.870 --> 04:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
talking about funding a a large a large
 
04:25:43.469 --> 04:25:43.479 align:start position:0%
body of workers who would be empowered
 
04:25:46.349 --> 04:25:46.359 align:start position:0%
to go into people's houses uh visit them
 
04:25:50.550 --> 04:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
at home and um provide what's called
 
04:25:53.830 --> 04:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
informal and motivational counseling so
 
04:25:57.030 --> 04:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
informal counseling motivational
 
04:25:59.990 --> 04:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
counseling and quote other services that
 
04:26:03.389 --> 04:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
the commissioner defines by
 
04:26:05.670 --> 04:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
rules that seems to me an
 
04:26:08.950 --> 04:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily vague definition for
 
04:26:11.469 --> 04:26:11.479 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for somebody who does
 
04:26:13.950 --> 04:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
not have any medical credentials to
 
04:26:16.950 --> 04:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
speak of that would we we would be
 
04:26:18.149 --> 04:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
offering a
 
04:26:20.429 --> 04:26:20.439 align:start position:0%
certification in order to cover their
 
04:26:23.710 --> 04:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
services under our Medicaid
 
04:26:26.670 --> 04:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
Program I would assert that that is a a
 
04:26:28.590 --> 04:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
rather substantial expansion of
 
04:26:30.910 --> 04:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
government it puts us on the hook for
 
04:26:34.469 --> 04:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
approximately $4.2 million in the next
 
04:26:36.990 --> 04:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
budget cycle uh actually in the first
 
04:26:38.750 --> 04:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
year of the next budget cycle I should
 
04:26:41.950 --> 04:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
say and an indeterminant amount of
 
04:26:44.590 --> 04:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
expens expenditure
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
thereafter Mr Speaker I urge my
 
04:26:51.950 --> 04:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
colleagues to vote um no on the a to
 
04:26:54.469 --> 04:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
pass motion so that a better motion can
 
04:26:57.950 --> 04:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
be made thank you Mr Speaker chair
 
04:27:01.910 --> 04:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:05.349 --> 04:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr
 
04:27:09.429 --> 04:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
Speaker so House Bill 403 does a bunch
 
04:27:11.630 --> 04:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
of things because it's one of those
 
04:27:15.429 --> 04:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
omnibus Bills first it extends the
 
04:27:17.630 --> 04:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
deadline for the legislative committee
 
04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
on interdisciplinary Primary Care
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
Workforce issues which I think we've
 
04:27:23.349 --> 04:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
already done once
 
04:27:28.229 --> 04:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
already second with respect to lnas
 
04:27:31.389 --> 04:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
licensed nurse
 
04:27:34.429 --> 04:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
assistants currently under
 
04:27:38.109 --> 04:27:38.119 align:start position:0%
rule they must work for two years
 
04:27:41.229 --> 04:27:41.239 align:start position:0%
full-time in a nursing home or other
 
04:27:44.429 --> 04:27:44.439 align:start position:0%
occupational setting before they can
 
04:27:49.189 --> 04:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
even take the training and then the
 
04:27:51.830 --> 04:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
certification to be a
 
04:27:54.790 --> 04:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
medication uh to administer
 
04:27:54.800 --> 04:27:56.510 align:start position:0%
medication uh to administer
medications

04:27:56.510 --> 04:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
medications
 
04:28:00.469 --> 04:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
so this is of concern to our nursing
 
04:28:03.429 --> 04:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
homes and other health care
 
04:28:07.349 --> 04:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
entities and the committee believed that
 
04:28:10.070 --> 04:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
lowering the amount of time you have to
 
04:28:12.349 --> 04:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
work before you can take the training
 
04:28:16.229 --> 04:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
and the certification exam to a year of
 
04:28:19.070 --> 04:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
full-time employment was reasonable and
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
it will certainly help with our health
 
04:28:24.149 --> 04:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
care crisis because it will increase the
 
04:28:26.309 --> 04:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
number of people who can assist with
 
04:28:28.469 --> 04:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
medication administration so that's
 
04:28:28.479 --> 04:28:29.429 align:start position:0%
medication administration so that's
number

04:28:29.429 --> 04:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:28:33.590 --> 04:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
two then there's the community health
 
04:28:37.990 --> 04:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
workers and there is no overlap with
 
04:28:41.149 --> 04:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
what the other currently licensed
 
04:28:43.309 --> 04:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
professions do
 
04:28:46.630 --> 04:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
what the community health workers do is
 
04:28:50.389 --> 04:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
they are a liaison between patients and
 
04:28:53.349 --> 04:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
the Health Care System particularly for
 
04:28:56.349 --> 04:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
people who find the Health Care System
 
04:28:58.830 --> 04:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
particularly bewildering or
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
inaccessible so they help people get to
 
04:29:01.439 --> 04:29:02.469 align:start position:0%
inaccessible so they help people get to
their

04:29:02.469 --> 04:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:29:07.349 --> 04:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
appointments they help people get their
 
04:29:11.309 --> 04:29:11.319 align:start position:0%
medications they help people find free
 
04:29:15.109 --> 04:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
cancer SC screenings the joy of this
 
04:29:18.990 --> 04:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
position is that these people the
 
04:29:22.710 --> 04:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
healthc care workers establish a rapport
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
with a patient who may otherwise have
 
04:29:29.309 --> 04:29:29.319 align:start position:0%
real barriers to obtaining Health Care
 
04:29:32.429 --> 04:29:32.439 align:start position:0%
in a timely and appropriate Manner and
 
04:29:37.550 --> 04:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
get them to early care early help and
 
04:29:41.349 --> 04:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
get them to be the healthiest person
 
04:29:43.469 --> 04:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
they can possibly possibly be they also
 
04:29:47.229 --> 04:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
help with things like food distributions
 
04:29:47.239 --> 04:29:48.389 align:start position:0%
help with things like food distributions
social

04:29:48.389 --> 04:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
social
 
04:29:51.990 --> 04:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
supports and other things that just make
 
04:29:53.950 --> 04:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
for a healthier
 
04:29:58.830 --> 04:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
population just managing to uh avoid the
 
04:30:01.109 --> 04:30:01.119 align:start position:0%
no-show appointments when somebody
 
04:30:02.910 --> 04:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
suddenly realizes they can't get to
 
04:30:06.550 --> 04:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
their appointment is a real Boon for all
 
04:30:08.590 --> 04:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
of us because it makes the Health Care
 
04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
system work better for all of
 
04:30:13.990 --> 04:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
us currently these positions are often
 
04:30:16.229 --> 04:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
funded by grants and the grants are for
 
04:30:19.790 --> 04:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
a year or for two years or for 3 years
 
04:30:22.109 --> 04:30:22.119 align:start position:0%
and you just get a good robust system
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
going and the grant runs out and the
 
04:30:26.910 --> 04:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
system falls apart and the wheels come
 
04:30:29.550 --> 04:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
off and some of the workers decide that
 
04:30:31.510 --> 04:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
they really need to go and do some other
 
04:30:34.149 --> 04:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
kind of work because although they love
 
04:30:38.269 --> 04:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
this job they need a job so what this
 
04:30:42.189 --> 04:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
bill does is it allows certification
 
04:30:46.429 --> 04:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid funding for these positions
 
04:30:50.630 --> 04:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
which make life considerably better for
 
04:30:53.229 --> 04:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
the people receiving the services
 
04:30:55.269 --> 04:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
considerably better for the people with
 
04:30:55.279 --> 04:30:55.990 align:start position:0%
considerably better for the people with
the

04:30:55.990 --> 04:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:30:58.950 --> 04:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
certification and somewhat better for
 
04:31:03.030 --> 04:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
all the rest of us so I urge you to vote
 
04:31:06.030 --> 04:31:06.040 align:start position:0%

04:31:09.790 --> 04:31:09.800 align:start position:0%

Speaker a long time ago we dispensed
 
04:35:24.910 --> 04:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
with uh what I lovingly call the the
 
04:35:28.390 --> 04:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
Walk of Shame when people failed to vote
 
04:35:31.990 --> 04:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
um on a roll call vote they had to come
 
04:35:34.629 --> 04:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
down declare their vote and apologize
 
04:35:37.629 --> 04:35:37.639 align:start position:0%
for not voting we did away with it to
 
04:35:40.029 --> 04:35:40.039 align:start position:0%
save time we we felt that it would save
 
04:35:42.390 --> 04:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
time by simply doing a thumbs up or a
 
04:35:44.789 --> 04:35:44.799 align:start position:0%
thumbs down but it seems that we have
 
04:35:48.310 --> 04:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
more and more people failing to vote and
 
04:35:50.109 --> 04:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
it taking the time of the clerk it's
 
04:35:52.390 --> 04:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
taking the time of the house and I was
 
04:35:54.990 --> 04:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
wondering Mr Speaker if you'd like to go
 
04:35:57.750 --> 04:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
back to our our previous practice of
 
04:35:59.830 --> 04:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
having people come down to declare their
 
04:36:02.429 --> 04:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
vote and apologize for not voting in a
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
timely manner so that we can speed these
 
04:36:04.799 --> 04:36:07.590 align:start position:0%
timely manner so that we can speed these
proceedings

Committee it passed on the consent

calendar it essentially changes the
 
04:36:57.789 --> 04:36:57.799 align:start position:0%
procedure by which a person can petition
 
04:36:59.910 --> 04:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
for name change to deal with the
 
04:37:01.949 --> 04:37:01.959 align:start position:0%
situation of people who petition for
 
04:37:03.310 --> 04:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
name change if they have a criminal

record or are serving a sentence that
 
04:37:07.709 --> 04:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
kind of thing um we sent it over to the

Senate on the consent calendar the
 
04:37:11.830 --> 04:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
Senate made a very minor uh technical
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
change that actually improves the bill
 
04:37:16.429 --> 04:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
the way the bill was worded as it left
 
04:37:18.949 --> 04:37:18.959 align:start position:0%
us was to say that if somebody is
 
04:37:21.551 --> 04:37:21.561 align:start position:0%
incarcerated before they the name change
 
04:37:23.670 --> 04:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
competition can go forward the
 
04:37:26.349 --> 04:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections has to be
 
04:37:29.429 --> 04:37:29.439 align:start position:0%

be not notified the Senate made that
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
change which is a beneficial change um
 
04:37:39.990 --> 04:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
apparently Corrections and safety don't
 
04:37:42.029 --> 04:37:42.039 align:start position:0%
always talk to each other I'm quite sure
 
04:37:45.230 --> 04:37:45.240 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr Speaker and esteemed
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
colleagues the demand for nurses has
 
04:39:12.590 --> 04:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
been a problem even before 20 20 and
 
04:39:15.390 --> 04:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
that problem grew expens exponentially
 
04:39:15.400 --> 04:39:16.429 align:start position:0%
that problem grew expens exponentially
after

04:39:16.429 --> 04:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
after
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
2020 if an evaluation of the problem was
 
04:39:21.869 --> 04:39:21.879 align:start position:0%
broken down we would find that there
 
04:39:24.109 --> 04:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
were a number of conditions contributing
 
04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
to today's shortage from Millennial
 
04:39:29.590 --> 04:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
career selections and working
 
04:39:31.709 --> 04:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
motivations to the hospital work
 
04:39:34.750 --> 04:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
environment and paygrades to economic
 
04:39:36.750 --> 04:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
conditions in New Hampshire there are a
 
04:39:38.708 --> 04:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
number of reasons the number of people
 
04:39:40.910 --> 04:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
selecting nursing as a career are
 
04:39:40.920 --> 04:39:43.590 align:start position:0%
selecting nursing as a career are
numerous

04:39:43.590 --> 04:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:45.390 --> 04:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
04:39:49.150 --> 04:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
456 is a bill that has has determined
 
04:39:51.150 --> 04:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
one solution is to throw money at the
 
04:39:53.830 --> 04:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
problem by offering funds toward student
 
04:39:56.830 --> 04:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness in committee we heard
 
04:39:59.590 --> 04:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
people testify that offering such a
 
04:40:02.150 --> 04:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
benefit will incentivize nurses to stay
 
04:40:05.030 --> 04:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I will admit this type
 
04:40:07.670 --> 04:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
of benefit has been successful placing
 
04:40:10.390 --> 04:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
lawyers and teachers in economically
 
04:40:12.350 --> 04:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
struggling areas is over a period of
 
04:40:15.550 --> 04:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
time in return for forgiving their
 
04:40:18.430 --> 04:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
school loans this forgiveness comes with
 
04:40:21.510 --> 04:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
the condition that these professionals
 
04:40:23.788 --> 04:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
remain in these depressed areas for 10
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
years and even then it is only a portion
 
04:40:28.670 --> 04:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
of the student
 
04:40:31.750 --> 04:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
loan this bill does not put any of these
 
04:40:33.948 --> 04:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
conditions on the bill which will allow
 
04:40:35.830 --> 04:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
a nursing professional to move on to
 
04:40:37.708 --> 04:40:37.718 align:start position:0%
greener pastures with no
 
04:40:40.390 --> 04:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
recourse I have worked in industry for
 
04:40:43.270 --> 04:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
nearly third 40 years part of my
 
04:40:46.190 --> 04:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities included hiring people
 
04:40:48.430 --> 04:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
mentoring successors and eventually
 
04:40:50.590 --> 04:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
growing them into positions of their
 
04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
dreams I rarely if ever found people
 
04:40:57.150 --> 04:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
interested in money to motivate them and
 
04:40:59.788 --> 04:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
if it did it was only
 
04:41:02.670 --> 04:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
temporary we need to focus on the work
 
04:41:04.590 --> 04:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
environment and the individuals in their
 
04:41:06.830 --> 04:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
work environment this is the key to
 
04:41:09.910 --> 04:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
solving our nursing shortage this bill
 
04:41:12.230 --> 04:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
allots $300,000
 
04:41:14.910 --> 04:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
for this benefit giving this money away
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
to incentivize professional n nurses
 
04:41:21.310 --> 04:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
with no condition is not wise and a
 
04:41:25.430 --> 04:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
gamble we do not want to gamble with the
 
04:41:28.628 --> 04:41:28.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money I ask you to join me in
 
04:41:30.550 --> 04:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
selecting the red button so we can
 
04:41:33.270 --> 04:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
consider another motion to be made and
 
04:41:36.270 --> 04:41:36.280 align:start position:0%

support of s SP 456 a bill that will
 
04:41:58.030 --> 04:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
make a modest but much needed expansion
 
04:42:00.750 --> 04:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
of the student student loan repayment
 
04:42:03.868 --> 04:42:03.878 align:start position:0%

Services office of rural Health this
 
04:42:11.510 --> 04:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
bill makes an appropriation of $300,000
 
04:42:13.430 --> 04:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
specifically directed to nursing

04:42:24.830 --> 04:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage generally in the
 
04:42:26.990 --> 04:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
health care field the shortage of
 
04:42:29.470 --> 04:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
nursing is particularly acute forcing
 
04:42:32.030 --> 04:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
many provider organizations to hire High
 
04:42:34.510 --> 04:42:34.520 align:start position:0%

04:42:36.708 --> 04:42:36.718 align:start position:0%

2021 it is a beautiful facility but
 
04:42:54.590 --> 04:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately onethird of the beds are
 
04:42:56.948 --> 04:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
closed due to staff
 
04:43:00.110 --> 04:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
shortages currently the student loan rep
 
04:43:03.310 --> 04:43:03.320 align:start position:0%

kinds 25 of of whom are RNs and nurse

practitioners without expanding the
 
04:43:18.590 --> 04:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria this new
 
04:43:20.830 --> 04:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation of just
 
04:43:23.868 --> 04:43:23.878 align:start position:0%
$300,000 will provide loan repayment for
 
04:43:27.430 --> 04:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
an additional 6 to 10 full-time nurses
 
04:43:29.070 --> 04:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
or as many as
 
04:43:31.350 --> 04:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
17 part-time
 
04:43:33.868 --> 04:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
nurses we understand that the healthcare
 
04:43:36.830 --> 04:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage is complex it's a
 
04:43:39.990 --> 04:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
complex puzzle with multiple causes high
 
04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
student loan burden which average
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
between 40 and
 
04:43:46.750 --> 04:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
$55,000 upon completion of an RN degree
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
are just one stressor for those in the
 
04:43:51.868 --> 04:43:51.878 align:start position:0%
field nevertheless student loan
 
04:43:54.070 --> 04:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
repayment is an effective proven method
 
04:43:56.830 --> 04:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
of recruiting and retaining workers it
 
04:43:58.868 --> 04:43:58.878 align:start position:0%
will help to retain nurses who may be
 
04:44:03.030 --> 04:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
tempted by more Rob robust repayment
 
04:44:05.990 --> 04:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
programs in neighboring states most
 
04:44:08.230 --> 04:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
importantly The increased assistance
 
04:44:10.830 --> 04:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
that this Pro appropriation will provide
 
04:44:13.310 --> 04:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
will will be extremely meaningful to
 
04:44:15.430 --> 04:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
both individual nurses and the
 
04:44:18.390 --> 04:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
organizations that employ them I urge
 
04:44:20.110 --> 04:44:20.120 align:start position:0%

actually existed within DHHS between

warming has and will continue to amplify
 
04:49:56.030 --> 04:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
and accelerate changes in our

04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
new concern is the northern progression

progression of mosquito born malaria
 
04:50:22.470 --> 04:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
which is now affecting areas south of

us while the structure for such a
 
04:50:27.150 --> 04:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
program will be at the discretion of the
 
04:50:29.390 --> 04:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner it should be noted that
 
04:50:31.830 --> 04:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
previously a grant funded position did
 
04:50:34.590 --> 04:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
exist within the department since no
 
04:50:37.150 --> 04:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
appropriation is included in this bill
 
04:50:39.070 --> 04:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
any additional funding to support

additional staff positions or or other
 
04:50:44.030 --> 04:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
expenses would have to be raised through
 
04:50:46.548 --> 04:50:46.558 align:start position:0%
new grants at no expense to the
 
04:50:49.590 --> 04:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers no new expense to the
 
04:50:52.750 --> 04:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers how do we know we need this we
 
04:50:54.670 --> 04:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
certain certainly can't predict the
 
04:50:57.590 --> 04:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
future that's the whole point
 
04:50:59.470 --> 04:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
establishing a climate and health
 
04:51:02.548 --> 04:51:02.558 align:start position:0%
Protection Program now will allow us to
 
04:51:04.310 --> 04:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
be ready later when we need to make
 
04:51:06.910 --> 04:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
adjustments to climate impacts that we
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
can't yet see or even
 
04:51:11.910 --> 04:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
imagine this is a common sense no
 
04:51:14.628 --> 04:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
expense effort to lay the groundwork for
 
04:51:17.070 --> 04:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
future threats to protect the public
 
04:51:19.670 --> 04:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
health of New Hampshire residents once
 
04:51:21.470 --> 04:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
again I urge you to push the red button
 
04:51:24.190 --> 04:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
to defeat the itl motion so that a
 
04:51:26.948 --> 04:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
better motion may be made be like a Boy

chronic effects from cyanotoxin exposure
 
04:51:55.948 --> 04:51:55.958 align:start position:0%
which has been on the increase with the
 
04:52:00.910 --> 04:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:03.590 --> 04:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
Lakes thank you for the question this is

this is precisely the type of impacts
 
04:52:09.910 --> 04:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
that this program would study analyze
 
04:52:12.670 --> 04:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
and make recommendations about both for
 
04:52:16.310 --> 04:52:16.320 align:start position:0%

these climate

changes Senate Bill 486 is about adding
 
04:52:46.830 --> 04:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
more work to the already strained
 
04:52:48.750 --> 04:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
resources at the Department of Health
 
04:52:51.750 --> 04:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
and Human res uh Human
 
04:52:54.548 --> 04:52:54.558 align:start position:0%
Services the the work needed included
 
04:52:56.590 --> 04:52:56.600 align:start position:0%
compiling information we already
 
04:52:58.868 --> 04:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
obtained during a previous DHHS
 
04:53:01.310 --> 04:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
assignment and distributing educational
 
04:53:03.788 --> 04:53:03.798 align:start position:0%
information warning the population of
 
04:53:06.830 --> 04:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
health concerns impacting impacted by
 
04:53:06.840 --> 04:53:07.990 align:start position:0%
health concerns impacting impacted by
climate

04:53:07.990 --> 04:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
climate
 
04:53:10.548 --> 04:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
change to reduce the strain on the
 
04:53:14.110 --> 04:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
already bustling DHHS Workforce there
 
04:53:16.708 --> 04:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
would be a plan to hire a person to
 
04:53:18.628 --> 04:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
oversee this effort at a cost of
 
04:53:18.638 --> 04:53:20.070 align:start position:0%
oversee this effort at a cost of
approximately

04:53:20.070 --> 04:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
04:53:23.510 --> 04:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
$165,000 per year over the next three
 
04:53:25.708 --> 04:53:25.718 align:start position:0%
years whether you believe in climate
 
04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
change or not there is supporting
 
04:53:30.470 --> 04:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
evidence that wildfires has caused
 
04:53:34.110 --> 04:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
respiratory issues in people of all ages
 
04:53:36.270 --> 04:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
it is true that there are more cases of
 
04:53:36.280 --> 04:53:37.590 align:start position:0%
it is true that there are more cases of
tickborne

04:53:37.590 --> 04:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
tickborne
 
04:53:39.948 --> 04:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
illnesses also true is that there are
 
04:53:43.190 --> 04:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
more cas cases of heat related health
 
04:53:46.470 --> 04:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
issues the question comes down to do we
 
04:53:48.310 --> 04:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
need to spend
 
04:53:51.708 --> 04:53:51.718 align:start position:0%
money uh to conduct a duplicate study
 
04:53:53.910 --> 04:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
and to further educate our constituents
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
of these health concerns I believe
 
04:53:58.910 --> 04:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
everyone listening to this speech knows
 
04:54:01.548 --> 04:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
enough to stay inside if there are wild
 
04:54:03.708 --> 04:54:03.718 align:start position:0%
wildfires in Canada affecting our air
 
04:54:06.470 --> 04:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
quality we know what a tick bite looks
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
like and what to do if we see one we
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
know to drink more water and keep
 
04:54:14.190 --> 04:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
ourselves cool during successive hot
 
04:54:17.390 --> 04:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
days and malaria if that day comes
 
04:54:20.150 --> 04:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
although new new to New England it is
 
04:54:22.390 --> 04:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
not a new illness we have not dealt with
 
04:54:25.788 --> 04:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
in other areas if we burden DHHS with
 
04:54:27.510 --> 04:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
this work it will further strain their
 
04:54:29.868 --> 04:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
workload that is already involved in
 
04:54:32.830 --> 04:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with our drug and alcohol
 
04:54:36.030 --> 04:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
effects uh drug and alcohol effects on
 
04:54:37.750 --> 04:54:37.760 align:start position:0%

daily lives today in order to lighten

this burden the alternative would cost
 
04:55:00.190 --> 04:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
money to our already bulging

thank you Mr

Speaker in committee there was concern
 
05:03:25.470 --> 05:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
over why these two drugs were singled
 
05:03:28.350 --> 05:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
out for a report why not compile a
 
05:03:30.310 --> 05:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
report on the availability of other
 
05:03:33.548 --> 05:03:33.558 align:start position:0%
drugs then the US Food and Drug
 
05:03:36.470 --> 05:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
Administration an agency within
 
05:03:39.788 --> 05:03:39.798 align:start position:0%
DHHS already regulates the approval
 
05:03:42.830 --> 05:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
distribution and use of pharmaceuticals
 
05:03:45.110 --> 05:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
like muf pistone and
 
05:03:47.868 --> 05:03:47.878 align:start position:0%
misoprostol compiling a detailed report
 
05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
on the availability of these specific
 
05:03:53.150 --> 05:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals would be redundant given
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
existing oversight
 
05:03:58.470 --> 05:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
mechanisms also various stakeholders
 
05:04:01.190 --> 05:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
such as pharmaceutical companies Health
 
05:04:03.788 --> 05:04:03.798 align:start position:0%
Care Providers and public health
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
organizations already track the use and
 
05:04:10.070 --> 05:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
availability of these drugs a separate
 
05:04:12.590 --> 05:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
report would not add substantial new
 
05:04:14.750 --> 05:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
information to what they are gathering
 
05:04:19.750 --> 05:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis we have no data to show
 
05:04:22.670 --> 05:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
the availability of these drugs is even
 
05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
a problem and directing DHHS to do this
 
05:04:29.110 --> 05:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
would add an unneeded task to their
 
05:04:30.788 --> 05:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
already full
 
05:04:33.230 --> 05:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
workload it would require Personnel
 
05:04:35.948 --> 05:04:35.958 align:start position:0%
Resources that should be allocated to
 
05:04:38.350 --> 05:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
other pressing public health
 
05:04:41.390 --> 05:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
issues this bill would also require
 
05:04:43.990 --> 05:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
additional Financial Resources as the
 
05:04:45.750 --> 05:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
department anticipates that it will need
 
05:04:48.708 --> 05:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
to hire a new staff position to oversee
 
05:04:52.590 --> 05:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
the work required by it DHHS is unable
 
05:04:54.788 --> 05:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
to determine whether there will be costs
 
05:04:59.788 --> 05:04:59.798 align:start position:0%
in fiscal years 2026 and 27 as the bill
 
05:05:02.390 --> 05:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
is not specific with respect to their
 
05:05:05.670 --> 05:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
responsibilities involved with quote
 
05:05:08.470 --> 05:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
protecting and expanding access end
 
05:05:11.948 --> 05:05:11.958 align:start position:0%
quote to these drug drugs this bill was

inquiry Mr Speaker if I know that
 
05:06:59.190 --> 05:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
medication abortion is under attack in a
 
05:07:02.070 --> 05:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
current US Supreme Court case and if I
 
05:07:04.430 --> 05:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
also know that medication abortion which
 
05:07:08.030 --> 05:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
includes both mistone and Miss mprosta
 
05:07:11.190 --> 05:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
is only available to patients up until
 
05:07:13.548 --> 05:07:13.558 align:start position:0%
the 11th week of a
 
05:07:16.190 --> 05:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and finally Mr Speaker if I
 
05:07:18.270 --> 05:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
know that Granite Staters need access to
 
05:07:20.708 --> 05:07:20.718 align:start position:0%
mistone and Misa prol which are both
 
05:07:22.990 --> 05:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
vital medications for abortion and
 
05:07:25.750 --> 05:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
miscarriage care and that we need to
 
05:07:27.948 --> 05:07:27.958 align:start position:0%
know if there are disparities in Access
 
05:07:30.670 --> 05:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
across the state would I now vote red
 
05:07:33.030 --> 05:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
against the itl so another motion may be
 
05:07:33.040 --> 05:07:33.948 align:start position:0%
against the itl so another motion may be
brought

05:07:33.948 --> 05:07:33.958 align:start position:0%

05:07:36.190 --> 05:07:36.200 align:start position:0%

05:07:42.390 --> 05:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:43.830 --> 05:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:07:47.310 --> 05:07:47.320 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know there is concern over
 
05:07:49.470 --> 05:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
why these two drugs are being singled
 
05:07:54.030 --> 05:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
out for a report and there is no data to
 
05:07:56.548 --> 05:07:56.558 align:start position:0%
show the availability of these drugs is
 
05:07:59.430 --> 05:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
even a problem and if I know that
 
05:08:02.390 --> 05:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
directing DHHS to do this would add an
 
05:08:04.310 --> 05:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
unneeded task to their already full
 
05:08:07.070 --> 05:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
workload and require personnel and
 
05:08:08.910 --> 05:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
financial resources that should be
 
05:08:11.868 --> 05:08:11.878 align:start position:0%
allocated to other other pressing public
 
05:08:16.150 --> 05:08:16.160 align:start position:0%

05:08:19.750 --> 05:08:19.760 align:start position:0%

05:13:55.750 --> 05:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
hland thank you Mr Speaker uh Senate
 
05:13:59.230 --> 05:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 63 amends RSA
 
05:14:02.190 --> 05:14:02.200 align:start position:0%
1471 which provides the authority to the
 
05:14:04.990 --> 05:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
municipal Public Health officer to make
 
05:14:07.590 --> 05:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
regulations to prevent and remove
 
05:14:09.750 --> 05:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
nuisances which are better known under
 
05:14:11.948 --> 05:14:11.958 align:start position:0%
the category of toilets drains
 
05:14:14.990 --> 05:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
expectoration rubbish and waste and
 
05:14:19.070 --> 05:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
other uh related public health issues
 
05:14:21.788 --> 05:14:21.798 align:start position:0%
and so the public health officer works
 
05:14:25.110 --> 05:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
very similar to the uh municipal code
 
05:14:28.910 --> 05:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer and in both cases
 
05:14:31.510 --> 05:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
the state provides the guidelines and
 
05:14:31.520 --> 05:14:32.628 align:start position:0%
the state provides the guidelines and
the

05:14:32.628 --> 05:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:14:36.868 --> 05:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
regulations and then the uh local uh
 
05:14:39.670 --> 05:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
Public Health officer in that that
 
05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
regulation goes to the local governing
 
05:14:45.110 --> 05:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
body where an ordinance is generated
 
05:14:47.830 --> 05:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
that allows the authority of them to
 
05:14:49.948 --> 05:14:49.958 align:start position:0%
enforce the state
 
05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
regulations and so the this legislation
 
05:14:56.788 --> 05:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
really seeks to narrow the scope of the
 
05:14:57.990 --> 05:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
public health
 
05:15:00.830 --> 05:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
officer and uh
 
05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
intentionally that scope in nuisances
 
05:15:05.990 --> 05:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
was broad because the state really
 
05:15:08.510 --> 05:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure what nuisances would come
 
05:15:11.548 --> 05:15:11.558 align:start position:0%
along and they wanted some flexibility
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
as they began to adopt regulations and
 
05:15:18.708 --> 05:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
laws and ensure that the local public
 
05:15:22.150 --> 05:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
health officer could enforce them and so
 
05:15:24.948 --> 05:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
as we went through the public hearing it
 
05:15:29.310 --> 05:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
there really was no clear um evidence
 
05:15:32.110 --> 05:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
shown that the public health officers
 
05:15:34.548 --> 05:15:34.558 align:start position:0%
was in fact coopting the power of the
 
05:15:37.190 --> 05:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
state and generating legislation they
 
05:15:39.910 --> 05:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
really were in fact enforcement
 
05:15:42.070 --> 05:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
another concern that was raised is that
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps the public health officer would
 
05:15:48.270 --> 05:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
work outside of nuisances and would in
 
05:15:52.350 --> 05:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
fact try to address more uh significant
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
public health issues and in fact the
 
05:15:57.948 --> 05:15:57.958 align:start position:0%
role of the P public health officer in
 
05:16:00.670 --> 05:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
those conditions is clearly defined in
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
State legisl uh legislation and so for
 
05:16:06.310 --> 05:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
example when you deal with uh
 
05:16:09.270 --> 05:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
communicable or infectious diseases that
 
05:16:11.990 --> 05:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
really resides under RSA
 
05:16:15.628 --> 05:16:15.638 align:start position:0%
141 and again there the state has
 
05:16:19.708 --> 05:16:19.718 align:start position:0%
control of the uh guidelines and
 
05:16:22.070 --> 05:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
regulations and the role of the public
 
05:16:24.670 --> 05:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
health officer is to report if outbreaks
 
05:16:27.270 --> 05:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
are occurring in their communities and
 
05:16:30.150 --> 05:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
then to enforce the guidelines and
 
05:16:32.670 --> 05:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
regulations that the state uh is
 
05:16:35.150 --> 05:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
enacting and that holds true through all
 
05:16:37.590 --> 05:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
other public health uh issues including
 
05:16:39.750 --> 05:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
up to Public Health Emergency
 
05:16:42.548 --> 05:16:42.558 align:start position:0%
and so what the minority of the the
 
05:16:45.628 --> 05:16:45.638 align:start position:0%
committee found is there really was
 
05:16:47.830 --> 05:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
adequate safeguards in place for the
 
05:16:50.270 --> 05:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
public health officer and there really
 
05:16:52.670 --> 05:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
was no evidence that it needed to be
 
05:16:55.430 --> 05:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
changed and so this is why the minority
 
05:16:57.670 --> 05:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
of the committee recommended inexpedient
 
05:17:00.350 --> 05:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
to legislate and we' hope you follow our
 
05:17:03.430 --> 05:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation thank
 
05:17:05.990 --> 05:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
you J recogniz representative Harve
 
05:17:06.000 --> 05:17:10.190 align:start position:0%
you J recogniz representative Harve
bolia

05:17:10.190 --> 05:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:12.708 --> 05:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I rise
 
05:17:15.788 --> 05:17:15.798 align:start position:0%
in support of a motion of OTP on this
 
05:17:18.590 --> 05:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
bill this bill clarifies what sorts of
 
05:17:21.230 --> 05:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
ordinances can be enacted by towns under
 
05:17:23.948 --> 05:17:23.958 align:start position:0%
this rarely used
 
05:17:26.270 --> 05:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
law uh it doesn't prevent a health
 
05:17:28.590 --> 05:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
officer from doing their job in any way
 
05:17:31.310 --> 05:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
as you may have heard um in in fact the
 
05:17:35.070 --> 05:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism of this law is
 
05:17:39.110 --> 05:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
untouched it's later it's it's in 146
 
05:17:43.708 --> 05:17:43.718 align:start position:0%
but it's we're not addressing that so um
 
05:17:46.230 --> 05:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
this is just a very rarely used section
 
05:17:48.150 --> 05:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
of the laws they said neither does it
 
05:17:51.110 --> 05:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
prevent them from coordinating with DHHS
 
05:17:53.628 --> 05:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
to address emergencies as some may have
 
05:17:55.590 --> 05:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
claimed the president of the health
 
05:17:57.750 --> 05:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
Officers Association and DHHS are
 
05:17:59.830 --> 05:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
friendly to this language and the
 
05:18:02.030 --> 05:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
language is consistent with everything
 
05:18:05.590 --> 05:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
that DHHS already has in their guidance
 
05:18:07.868 --> 05:18:07.878 align:start position:0%
documents three reasons why we need this
 
05:18:11.230 --> 05:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
bill though first in testimony we heard
 
05:18:13.788 --> 05:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
how towns were passing ordinances which
 
05:18:15.948 --> 05:18:15.958 align:start position:0%
required additional fees additional
 
05:18:19.270 --> 05:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
licensing even and other onerous
 
05:18:22.430 --> 05:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
requirements which serve to gatekeep
 
05:18:25.430 --> 05:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
certain businesses out of town similar
 
05:18:28.910 --> 05:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
to a zoning ordinance for instance
 
05:18:31.510 --> 05:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
several towns have enacted Health
 
05:18:34.070 --> 05:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
ordinances requiring that only
 
05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
Physicians can open tattoo parlors or
 
05:18:39.548 --> 05:18:39.558 align:start position:0%
pierce ears
 
05:18:42.190 --> 05:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
even and Mr Speaker we all know about
 
05:18:43.948 --> 05:18:43.958 align:start position:0%
how mask mandates were enacted using
 
05:18:47.390 --> 05:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
this law but did you know that Handover
 
05:18:50.190 --> 05:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
also used this law to mandate that
 
05:18:53.430 --> 05:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
people needed to keep lists of
 
05:18:56.910 --> 05:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
visitors appearing in their homes and if
 
05:18:59.350 --> 05:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
they had more than 10 guests they needed
 
05:19:02.230 --> 05:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
a permit to have those
 
05:19:05.110 --> 05:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
guests second there's no public hearing
 
05:19:07.830 --> 05:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
requirement under this section of Law
 
05:19:11.750 --> 05:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
and no over oversight by DHHS when an
 
05:19:13.230 --> 05:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
ordinance is
 
05:19:16.750 --> 05:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
passed finally Health officers are
 
05:19:18.910 --> 05:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
usually only part-time employees and in
 
05:19:21.788 --> 05:19:21.798 align:start position:0%
some cases unpaid
 
05:19:24.868 --> 05:19:24.878 align:start position:0%
volunteers who who need just three hours
 
05:19:28.270 --> 05:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
of training which I hear is that is also
 
05:19:30.350 --> 05:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
not enforced by
 
05:19:32.470 --> 05:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
DHHS three hours of training is not
 
05:19:34.910 --> 05:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
sufficient training to pass Health
 
05:19:37.390 --> 05:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
mandates which affect the population of
 
05:19:40.948 --> 05:19:40.958 align:start position:0%
an entire town without some
 
05:19:45.190 --> 05:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
oversight that is why we employ epidemi
 
05:19:47.070 --> 05:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
epidemiologists we've already voted and
 
05:19:48.628 --> 05:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
passed a different version of this bill
 
05:19:51.190 --> 05:19:51.200 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
05:21:53.030 --> 05:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
if I know that New Hampshire accepts the
 
05:21:55.750 --> 05:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
broad authority of Health officers to
 
05:21:58.510 --> 05:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
navig to investigate public health and
 
05:22:01.390 --> 05:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
sanitary concerns and if I know this
 
05:22:03.948 --> 05:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
broad Authority is required because
 
05:22:06.070 --> 05:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
Public Health officials must be able to
 
05:22:08.708 --> 05:22:08.718 align:start position:0%
respond in a timely and effective manner
 
05:22:11.830 --> 05:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
to infinite threats to Public Health and
 
05:22:14.190 --> 05:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that legislators
 
05:22:17.190 --> 05:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
have consistently created amended and
 
05:22:19.670 --> 05:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
added to statutes to recognize several
 
05:22:22.788 --> 05:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
of these Public Health threats including
 
05:22:25.548 --> 05:22:25.558 align:start position:0%
sewage contaminants and soils
 
05:22:28.470 --> 05:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
contaminantes and groundwater biological
 
05:22:30.628 --> 05:22:30.638 align:start position:0%
hazards in swimming pools and bathing
 
05:22:34.868 --> 05:22:34.878 align:start position:0%
places threats for marine species asbest
 
05:22:37.030 --> 05:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
and every sort of communicable disease
 
05:22:39.948 --> 05:22:39.958 align:start position:0%
including measles then Mr Speaker would
 
05:22:42.110 --> 05:22:42.120 align:start position:0%

05:33:11.948 --> 05:33:11.958 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:33:14.628 --> 05:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
you representative Powers recognized to
 
05:33:19.628 --> 05:33:19.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:23.110 --> 05:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
05:33:25.390 --> 05:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
support of the motion inexpedient to
 
05:33:27.590 --> 05:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
legislate on Senate Bell
 
05:33:30.948 --> 05:33:30.958 align:start position:0%
538 Mr Speaker I fully acknowledge the
 
05:33:32.750 --> 05:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
fact that here in the granite state
 
05:33:35.788 --> 05:33:35.798 align:start position:0%
there's a housing crisis as a result
 
05:33:38.270 --> 05:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
year after year we see a number of bills
 
05:33:41.230 --> 05:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
that seek to address this issue some of
 
05:33:43.868 --> 05:33:43.878 align:start position:0%
which are effective and others like this
 
05:33:46.948 --> 05:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
bill which does very little to actually
 
05:33:50.230 --> 05:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
address the problem and instead creates
 
05:33:52.868 --> 05:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
new problems now let me
 
05:33:56.150 --> 05:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
explain first this bill incentivizes the
 
05:33:58.830 --> 05:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
conversion of office industrial or
 
05:34:02.510 --> 05:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
commercial spaces to residential use by
 
05:34:06.030 --> 05:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
giving Property Owners tax relief for up
 
05:34:06.040 --> 05:34:09.030 align:start position:0%
giving Property Owners tax relief for up
to5

05:34:09.030 --> 05:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
to5
 
05:34:12.030 --> 05:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
years understand that this tax relief is
 
05:34:15.110 --> 05:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
not free since the tax burden will be
 
05:34:17.910 --> 05:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
subsidized by the rest of the taxpayers
 
05:34:22.110 --> 05:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
in the town or city again for up to 15
 
05:34:25.430 --> 05:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
years moreover an unintended consequence
 
05:34:27.628 --> 05:34:27.638 align:start position:0%
of this bill is that businesses will be
 
05:34:30.110 --> 05:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
disrupted when their leases are not
 
05:34:32.590 --> 05:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
renewed and the business space they
 
05:34:35.670 --> 05:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
occupy is is converted to residential
 
05:34:38.230 --> 05:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
use forcing these business businesses to
 
05:34:39.190 --> 05:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
have to
 
05:34:42.830 --> 05:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
relocate and find new business space if
 
05:34:46.150 --> 05:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
they can as a result this bill will hurt
 
05:34:49.150 --> 05:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers as well as business owners
 
05:34:52.390 --> 05:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
second this bill not only requires the
 
05:34:55.310 --> 05:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
planning board to consider proposals for
 
05:34:57.948 --> 05:34:57.958 align:start position:0%
alternative Parking Solutions to on-site
 
05:35:00.708 --> 05:35:00.718 align:start position:0%
parking requirements it goes a step
 
05:35:03.910 --> 05:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
further penalizing the planning board if
 
05:35:06.310 --> 05:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
it does not approve the alternative
 
05:35:10.030 --> 05:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
parking proposal for any reason and it
 
05:35:12.628 --> 05:35:12.638 align:start position:0%
also requires the planning board instead
 
05:35:16.030 --> 05:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
of the applicant to both request and pay
 
05:35:18.110 --> 05:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
for a thirdparty
 
05:35:21.030 --> 05:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
review notably these new requirements
 
05:35:23.750 --> 05:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
are in direct contrast with how third
 
05:35:26.548 --> 05:35:26.558 align:start position:0%
party reviews are currently conducted
 
05:35:30.350 --> 05:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
under law as a result this bill mandates
 
05:35:33.350 --> 05:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
new costs to municipalities and creates
 
05:35:36.350 --> 05:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
conflicts in statute with chapter
 
05:35:40.510 --> 05:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
676 f finally and most detrimental this
 
05:35:44.070 --> 05:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
bill enables a town to give the select
 
05:35:47.030 --> 05:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
board the permanent authority to propose
 
05:35:50.230 --> 05:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
and to approve zoning amendments at any
 
05:35:53.868 --> 05:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
time after a single public Hearing in
 
05:35:55.750 --> 05:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
other words this bill essentially
 
05:35:58.070 --> 05:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
removes the planning board's authority
 
05:36:00.910 --> 05:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
to both study and to propose zoning
 
05:36:04.310 --> 05:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
amendments ensuring consistency with the
 
05:36:07.948 --> 05:36:07.958 align:start position:0%
Town Master Plan and it also Str strips
 
05:36:11.310 --> 05:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
the town residents of the ability to to
 
05:36:13.548 --> 05:36:13.558 align:start position:0%
approve zoning amendments by official
 
05:36:17.510 --> 05:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
ballot on Town election day eradicating
 
05:36:20.310 --> 05:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
the current system of checks and
 
05:36:23.310 --> 05:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
balances as a result this bill
 
05:36:26.150 --> 05:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
fundamentally changes the function and
 
05:36:29.390 --> 05:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
the structure of Municipal local
 
05:36:32.750 --> 05:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
government and creates more unresolved
 
05:36:36.310 --> 05:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
statutory conflicts with chapter 675 and
 
05:36:38.548 --> 05:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
possibly other RSA
 
05:36:42.110 --> 05:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
to conclude Senate Bill 538
 
05:36:44.868 --> 05:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
disadvantages taxpayers and business
 
05:36:47.430 --> 05:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
tenants it erodes the structure and
 
05:36:49.628 --> 05:36:49.638 align:start position:0%
function of municipal government and
 
05:36:53.750 --> 05:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
creates conflicts in stature and statute
 
05:36:56.270 --> 05:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
therefore I urge my fellow colleagues to
 
05:36:58.590 --> 05:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
support the committee recommendation of
 
05:37:01.628 --> 05:37:01.638 align:start position:0%

05:37:04.670 --> 05:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 538 and I ask for a
 
05:37:10.548 --> 05:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:11.990 --> 05:37:12.000 align:start position:0%

representative stavis can be heard when
 
05:39:30.070 --> 05:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:33.910 --> 05:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
05:39:36.030 --> 05:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
if I know and we've all acknowledged
 
05:39:37.868 --> 05:39:37.878 align:start position:0%
that there simply isn't enough housing
 
05:39:39.430 --> 05:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to sustain the
 
05:39:42.110 --> 05:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
workforce we need and if I know that
 
05:39:43.990 --> 05:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
this lack of housing threatens our
 
05:39:47.948 --> 05:39:47.958 align:start position:0%
businesses our economy and our society
 
05:39:50.110 --> 05:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
and if I know that a few simple
 
05:39:52.270 --> 05:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
adjustments to our zoning and planning
 
05:39:54.788 --> 05:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
procedures would encourage a modest
 
05:39:57.390 --> 05:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
increase in this desperately needed
 
05:40:01.948 --> 05:40:01.958 align:start position:0%
Supply if I further know that s SP 538
 
05:40:04.670 --> 05:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
Builds on existing and very successful
 
05:40:07.990 --> 05:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
law to turn unused commercial space into
 
05:40:10.468 --> 05:40:10.478 align:start position:0%
new residences while providing
 
05:40:12.468 --> 05:40:12.478 align:start position:0%
Innovative tools for planning boards
 
05:40:14.910 --> 05:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
when considering new housing in their
 
05:40:17.310 --> 05:40:17.320 align:start position:0%
communities and if I also know that it
 
05:40:19.788 --> 05:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
has been amended to include language
 
05:40:21.708 --> 05:40:21.718 align:start position:0%
that this house has supported in a
 
05:40:24.270 --> 05:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
previous bill would I now press the
 
05:40:26.548 --> 05:40:26.558 align:start position:0%
green button to support the autop pass
 
05:40:28.750 --> 05:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
emotion and show that we are serious
 
05:40:30.868 --> 05:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
about our responsibility to meet this
 
05:40:37.708 --> 05:40:37.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:41.590 --> 05:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
my apologies would I now press the red
 
05:40:43.948 --> 05:40:43.958 align:start position:0%
button to overturn the itl motion so
 
05:40:47.948 --> 05:40:47.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:50.510 --> 05:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
made representative poers recognized for

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
05:41:01.030 --> 05:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill does very
 
05:41:03.230 --> 05:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
little to actually help the housing
 
05:41:05.990 --> 05:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
crisis and if I know that in fact this
 
05:41:08.830 --> 05:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
bill is extremely ill advised as it
 
05:41:11.510 --> 05:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
displaces business tenants making them
 
05:41:13.708 --> 05:41:13.718 align:start position:0%
homeless when business space is
 
05:41:16.788 --> 05:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
converted to residential use it burdens
 
05:41:19.468 --> 05:41:19.478 align:start position:0%
taxpayers requiring them to subsidize
 
05:41:22.628 --> 05:41:22.638 align:start position:0%
long-term tax relief incentives for up
 
05:41:26.150 --> 05:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
to 15 years it erodes the structure and
 
05:41:28.468 --> 05:41:28.478 align:start position:0%
function of municipal government by
 
05:41:30.270 --> 05:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
transferring zoning Amendment
 
05:41:33.230 --> 05:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
authorities from the planning board and
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
the voters to a small group of Selectmen
 
05:41:39.070 --> 05:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
and it also also creates new conflicts
 
05:41:42.548 --> 05:41:42.558 align:start position:0%
in statutes would I now vote Yes to
 
05:41:44.948 --> 05:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
support the committee recommendation of
 
05:41:47.230 --> 05:41:47.240 align:start position:0%

ought to pass representative Bill Boyd

05:43:42.468 --> 05:43:42.478 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
05:43:45.750 --> 05:43:45.760 align:start position:0%

05:43:47.310 --> 05:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
want to lift that microphone up a little
 
05:43:49.750 --> 05:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
bit pardon pull the microphone up a
 
05:43:54.190 --> 05:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
little closer to you okay um this bill
 
05:43:56.390 --> 05:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
seeks to bond $40
 
05:43:59.230 --> 05:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
million for design and Engineering of
 
05:44:00.910 --> 05:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
the new Men's
 
05:44:03.910 --> 05:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
prison last year the house gave 50
 
05:44:07.270 --> 05:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
million in general fund revenues for
 
05:44:07.280 --> 05:44:08.270 align:start position:0%
million in general fund revenues for
this

05:44:08.270 --> 05:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:44:11.628 --> 05:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
project the body on the other side saw
 
05:44:13.990 --> 05:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
fit to remove 40 million of that to
 
05:44:15.868 --> 05:44:15.878 align:start position:0%
spend El
 
05:44:19.230 --> 05:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
elsewhere now one short year later that
 
05:44:23.788 --> 05:44:23.798 align:start position:0%
same body seeks $40 million in bonding
 
05:44:26.830 --> 05:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
only with an interest cost of 21 million
 
05:44:30.548 --> 05:44:30.558 align:start position:0%
estimated a 42%
 
05:44:32.910 --> 05:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
increase the 10 million they already
 
05:44:36.390 --> 05:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
have in Corrections plus 40 million plus
 
05:44:39.750 --> 05:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
21 million in interest equals $71
 
05:44:43.390 --> 05:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
million total cost and that's just for
 
05:44:46.788 --> 05:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
the design and Engineering of the jail
 
05:44:50.468 --> 05:44:50.478 align:start position:0%
the most recent estimate for this prison
 
05:44:55.468 --> 05:44:55.478 align:start position:0%
is 600 million so that's a total of 671
 
05:44:58.430 --> 05:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
million the question is not if we're
 
05:45:00.430 --> 05:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
going to be should build a new prison or
 
05:45:02.390 --> 05:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
not the money was already appropriated
 
05:45:05.468 --> 05:45:05.478 align:start position:0%
for that last year it's just that the
 
05:45:07.590 --> 05:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
$21 million
 
05:45:11.390 --> 05:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
is too much to add this Project's been
 
05:45:14.390 --> 05:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
talked about for several years and it
 
05:45:17.030 --> 05:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
will take several years to complete so
 
05:45:19.708 --> 05:45:19.718 align:start position:0%
what's the rush with this bill it's too
 
05:45:22.190 --> 05:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
late in the banum to add this
 
05:45:24.750 --> 05:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
expenditure it should be properly P
 
05:45:27.868 --> 05:45:27.878 align:start position:0%
placed in the next budget cycle we

shortcoming of my

own after we had left the legisl after

05:46:30.868 --> 05:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:33.830 --> 05:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
legislature now to the issue at hand the
 
05:46:36.430 --> 05:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
committee report is thorough addressing
 
05:46:39.150 --> 05:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
the many failings of the current men's
 
05:46:43.150 --> 05:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
state prison located just down the road
 
05:46:45.110 --> 05:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
the most striking fact is that the
 
05:46:45.120 --> 05:46:46.190 align:start position:0%
the most striking fact is that the
committee

05:46:46.190 --> 05:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:46:49.670 --> 05:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
report contained a $40 million
 
05:46:52.468 --> 05:46:52.478 align:start position:0%
expenditure in last year's Senate Bill
 
05:46:56.310 --> 05:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
two but was removed so here we are with
 
05:46:56.320 --> 05:46:57.110 align:start position:0%
two but was removed so here we are with
an

05:46:57.110 --> 05:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:47:01.030 --> 05:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
expenditure a large expenditure on a uh
 
05:47:01.040 --> 05:47:02.590 align:start position:0%
expenditure a large expenditure on a uh
offe

05:47:02.590 --> 05:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
offe
 
05:47:04.990 --> 05:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
request before we held our hearing we
 
05:47:08.150 --> 05:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
toured the prison to see the current
 
05:47:10.468 --> 05:47:10.478 align:start position:0%
conditions and it's no better than when
 
05:47:13.990 --> 05:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
I toured it six years prior and has
 
05:47:14.000 --> 05:47:15.750 align:start position:0%
I toured it six years prior and has
greater

05:47:15.750 --> 05:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
greater
 
05:47:19.670 --> 05:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
issues for our own benefit we asked the
 
05:47:22.910 --> 05:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
treasurer to come to the committee and
 
05:47:26.590 --> 05:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
speak on what effect this would have on
 
05:47:31.070 --> 05:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
our recently upgraded Bond rating could
 
05:47:36.990 --> 05:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:39.110 --> 05:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
she came forward and said while she
 
05:47:41.948 --> 05:47:41.958 align:start position:0%
would not like to see this sort of
 
05:47:45.110 --> 05:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
expenditure brought forward off seon as
 
05:47:46.310 --> 05:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:47:50.910 --> 05:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
now that the the state has the
 
05:47:56.990 --> 05:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:00.468 --> 05:48:00.478 align:start position:0%
wish so that that took that burden away
 
05:48:03.750 --> 05:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
knowing that every project that I've
 
05:48:06.350 --> 05:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
ever been involved in in my 10e with
 
05:48:09.510 --> 05:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
whether it was the widening of 93 that
 
05:48:12.868 --> 05:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
started out at $100 million and ended at
 
05:48:12.878 --> 05:48:14.390 align:start position:0%
started out at $100 million and ended at
$250

05:48:14.390 --> 05:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
$250
 
05:48:16.670 --> 05:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
million the women's
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
prison that took us an extra I think it
 
05:48:22.990 --> 05:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
was four years to construct because we
 
05:48:25.030 --> 05:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough of an appropriation
 
05:48:27.390 --> 05:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
in there and when we brought it forward
 
05:48:30.270 --> 05:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
to get the final appropriation again it
 
05:48:32.670 --> 05:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
cost us millions of dollars
 
05:48:36.070 --> 05:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
more further knowing that there are only
 
05:48:38.910 --> 05:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:43.150 --> 05:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
um companies out there that even uh
 
05:48:45.430 --> 05:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
address how to build a
 
05:48:49.670 --> 05:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
Penitentiary delays make this worse so I
 
05:48:53.190 --> 05:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
ask is I ask you to vote with the

inquiry Mr Speaker Mr Speaker first time
 
05:51:06.320 --> 05:51:07.788 align:start position:0%
inquiry Mr Speaker Mr Speaker first time
at

05:51:07.788 --> 05:51:07.798 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:51:11.628 --> 05:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
well if I know that the $50 million in
 
05:51:16.310 --> 05:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 was for the new prison
 
05:51:19.910 --> 05:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
design was reduced by $40 million and
 
05:51:22.430 --> 05:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
the money was spent by the body on the
 
05:51:24.750 --> 05:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
other side for something else which I
 
05:51:28.070 --> 05:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
don't know and if I know that this bill
 
05:51:31.468 --> 05:51:31.478 align:start position:0%
would add $40 million back into the form
 
05:51:34.948 --> 05:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
of bonding but would add $21 million in
 
05:51:38.750 --> 05:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
interest which is 42% % increase would I
 
05:51:40.750 --> 05:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
now press the red button so another
 
05:51:44.910 --> 05:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
motion can be made and thank you Mr
 
05:51:46.910 --> 05:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker representative mcon is
 
05:51:52.750 --> 05:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:55.150 --> 05:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
05:51:57.590 --> 05:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker if you know that I do not
 
05:52:00.030 --> 05:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
typically favor a new capital
 
05:52:03.150 --> 05:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
expenditure in an off year and if you
 
05:52:05.030 --> 05:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
further know that the treasurer has
 
05:52:06.590 --> 05:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
assured the committee that this
 
05:52:09.788 --> 05:52:09.798 align:start position:0%
expenditure will not affect our bond
 
05:52:13.910 --> 05:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
rating and finally if I know a one-year
 
05:52:16.030 --> 05:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
delay will only slow the planning
 
05:52:18.910 --> 05:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
process and cost us millions of dollars
 
05:52:22.468 --> 05:52:22.478 align:start position:0%
in construction cost would I now uphold
 
05:52:25.910 --> 05:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
the majority committee position and pass
 
05:52:29.670 --> 05:52:29.680 align:start position:0%

having considered the same being unable
 
06:10:17.110 --> 06:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
to agree with the majority Report with
 
06:10:18.510 --> 06:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
the recommendation the bill ought to
 
06:10:20.390 --> 06:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
pass representative Thomas Corman for
 
06:10:22.110 --> 06:10:22.120 align:start position:0%

06:10:31.868 --> 06:10:31.878 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
06:10:33.830 --> 06:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
you might recall that when we
 
06:10:35.868 --> 06:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
deliberated HB
 
06:10:40.030 --> 06:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
1623 a few weeks ago I delivered a pi
 
06:10:42.390 --> 06:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
and in that Pi I pointed out that my
 
06:10:44.670 --> 06:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
good friend from eping who sponsored the
 
06:10:47.270 --> 06:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
bill referred to the bill as the New
 
06:10:50.190 --> 06:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire energy Independence act and at
 
06:10:53.430 --> 06:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
the time I disparaged the idea that we
 
06:10:56.868 --> 06:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
could become energy independent and part
 
06:11:00.270 --> 06:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
of my argument was that we rely on oil
 
06:11:03.788 --> 06:11:03.798 align:start position:0%
we rely on natural gas and as far as I
 
06:11:06.670 --> 06:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
know we don't produce either of those in
 
06:11:06.680 --> 06:11:07.510 align:start position:0%
know we don't produce either of those in
New

06:11:07.510 --> 06:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
New
 
06:11:10.270 --> 06:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire maybe we'll someday have a Jed
 
06:11:13.390 --> 06:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
clampet who shoots at some food and up
 
06:11:14.910 --> 06:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
through the ground comes a bubble and
 
06:11:17.468 --> 06:11:17.478 align:start position:0%
crude but I'm not betting on
 
06:11:17.478 --> 06:11:19.590 align:start position:0%
crude but I'm not betting on
that

06:11:19.590 --> 06:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:11:23.310 --> 06:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
so it it is not feasible for us to
 
06:11:23.320 --> 06:11:24.390 align:start position:0%
so it it is not feasible for us to
become

06:11:24.390 --> 06:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
become
 
06:11:26.750 --> 06:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
entirely energy
 
06:11:30.628 --> 06:11:30.638 align:start position:0%
independent it is however a nice
 
06:11:34.190 --> 06:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
thought and what we can do is become
 
06:11:36.868 --> 06:11:36.878 align:start position:0%
less energy energy
 
06:11:39.190 --> 06:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
dependent how can we do
 
06:11:41.868 --> 06:11:41.878 align:start position:0%
that we can produce energy in New
 
06:11:45.230 --> 06:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in fact we do and one of the
 
06:11:47.430 --> 06:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
ways that we do is with solar and
 
06:11:50.190 --> 06:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
another way that we do is with wind
 
06:11:52.430 --> 06:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
they're renewable and they produce no
 
06:11:54.708 --> 06:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
carbon those are good
 
06:11:58.510 --> 06:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
things but they are not reliable there
 
06:12:00.510 --> 06:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
are long periods of time where the sun
 
06:12:02.868 --> 06:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't shine and there are also periods
 
06:12:05.868 --> 06:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
of time when the wind doesn't blow
 
06:12:08.868 --> 06:12:08.878 align:start position:0%
so what can we do about that we can
 
06:12:12.868 --> 06:12:12.878 align:start position:0%
store that energy so that we can use it
 
06:12:14.628 --> 06:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
during those times that we don't have
 
06:12:18.468 --> 06:12:18.478 align:start position:0%
sunshine or wind and also that enables
 
06:12:23.788 --> 06:12:23.798 align:start position:0%
us to smooth out the load on the grid
 
06:12:26.430 --> 06:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
which actually will reduce rates because
 
06:12:28.670 --> 06:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
the grid has to be built for the
 
06:12:31.510 --> 06:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
maximum energy that goes on it if we can
 
06:12:33.788 --> 06:12:33.798 align:start position:0%
actually smooth it out that reduces
 
06:12:33.798 --> 06:12:36.190 align:start position:0%
actually smooth it out that reduces
rates

06:12:36.190 --> 06:12:36.200 align:start position:0%
rates
 
06:12:40.948 --> 06:12:40.958 align:start position:0%
hence batteries batteries are a way that
 
06:12:45.110 --> 06:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
we can become less energy dependent and
 
06:12:49.070 --> 06:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
have reliable renewable clean
 
06:12:51.190 --> 06:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
energy so now the question is how
 
06:12:52.910 --> 06:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
feasible is battery storage and the
 
06:12:55.310 --> 06:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
answer is it's really becoming
 
06:12:57.990 --> 06:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
increasingly feasible we're seeing
 
06:13:00.110 --> 06:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
utility scale storage happening in
 
06:13:00.120 --> 06:13:01.190 align:start position:0%
utility scale storage happening in
several

06:13:01.190 --> 06:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
several
 
06:13:03.628 --> 06:13:03.638 align:start position:0%
States and it's even planned now for
 
06:13:05.948 --> 06:13:05.958 align:start position:0%
Marx station in bu
 
06:13:09.270 --> 06:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
when they convert to solar and get off
 
06:13:11.750 --> 06:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
coal there's also a lot of what's called
 
06:13:13.750 --> 06:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
behindth meter battery storage for
 
06:13:16.590 --> 06:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
example I have batteries at my house I
 
06:13:18.788 --> 06:13:18.798 align:start position:0%
not only talk the talk I walk the walk I
 
06:13:21.190 --> 06:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
have solar panels I have batteries and
 
06:13:24.030 --> 06:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
I'm hardly ever using the
 
06:13:27.788 --> 06:13:27.798 align:start position:0%
grid so batteries really are important
 
06:13:30.070 --> 06:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
to our Energy Future but we don't know
 
06:13:32.830 --> 06:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
that much about them as a state we don't
 
06:13:35.190 --> 06:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
really know what to do and the
 
06:13:37.468 --> 06:13:37.478 align:start position:0%
technology of batteries is changing more
 
06:13:39.910 --> 06:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
rapidly than really any other energy
 
06:13:41.910 --> 06:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
technology you know we're all used to
 
06:13:44.670 --> 06:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
lithium ion batteries and I know some
 
06:13:46.270 --> 06:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
people think of them as heavy because
 
06:13:47.590 --> 06:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
EVS are
 
06:13:50.110 --> 06:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
heavy but actually as batteries go
 
06:13:52.190 --> 06:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
lithium ion are pretty
 
06:13:54.150 --> 06:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
lightweight but if you think about it
 
06:13:55.788 --> 06:13:55.798 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about utility scale
 
06:13:58.590 --> 06:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
storage or even batteries in your home
 
06:14:01.270 --> 06:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
who cares how much they weigh and there
 
06:14:04.110 --> 06:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
are new battery technologies that have
 
06:14:06.948 --> 06:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
heavier batteries but with really good
 
06:14:09.110 --> 06:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
qualities there's something called an
 
06:14:11.670 --> 06:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
iron air battery where actually the
 
06:14:14.310 --> 06:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
battery rusts and dust to discharge and
 
06:14:17.510 --> 06:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
charge and those are coming those are
 
06:14:19.868 --> 06:14:19.878 align:start position:0%
actually commercially feasible now there
 
06:14:21.510 --> 06:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
are also things called solid state
 
06:14:23.468 --> 06:14:23.478 align:start position:0%
batteries and I won't go into what that
 
06:14:24.948 --> 06:14:24.958 align:start position:0%
is about because I'd like you to stay
 
06:14:27.070 --> 06:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
awake until the end of my
 
06:14:29.670 --> 06:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
speech so what does this bill do it just
 
06:14:32.390 --> 06:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
simply has the department of energy
 
06:14:35.110 --> 06:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
study storage technology how to
 
06:14:39.230 --> 06:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
encourage investing in it and identify
 
06:14:43.110 --> 06:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
regulatory hurdles and Market barri
 
06:14:45.468 --> 06:14:45.478 align:start position:0%
barriers batteries are going to be an
 
06:14:48.110 --> 06:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
important part of our Energy
 
06:14:52.070 --> 06:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
Future our state needs to be ready and
 
06:14:55.750 --> 06:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
this bill will help us be ready so I
 
06:14:59.548 --> 06:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
hope that we can overturn the interim
 
06:15:02.510 --> 06:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
study this interim study yes interim
 
06:15:05.830 --> 06:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
study and go to another motion
 
06:15:09.310 --> 06:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I request a division
 
06:15:15.868 --> 06:15:15.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:18.510 --> 06:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr
 
06:15:20.948 --> 06:15:20.958 align:start position:0%
Speaker so as you heard this is a
 
06:15:22.628 --> 06:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
battery study
 
06:15:25.468 --> 06:15:25.478 align:start position:0%
bill there's an existing
 
06:15:30.150 --> 06:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
do uh or doe statute or chapter that
 
06:15:32.390 --> 06:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
already requires the department of
 
06:15:35.430 --> 06:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
energy to study battery techn
 
06:15:39.070 --> 06:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
technology what this bill does is divide
 
06:15:42.390 --> 06:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
that up into two different
 
06:15:45.030 --> 06:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
taskings the first tasking is to look at
 
06:15:47.310 --> 06:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
the financial regulatory legislative and
 
06:15:51.030 --> 06:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
Market hurdles or barriers to advance
 
06:15:56.670 --> 06:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
utility scale storage including utility
 
06:15:59.190 --> 06:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
investment the problem with that and the
 
06:16:01.990 --> 06:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
problem with the initial statute is the
 
06:16:05.070 --> 06:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
Department of energy has no legitimate
 
06:16:08.190 --> 06:16:08.200 align:start position:0%
function to do that
 
06:16:11.030 --> 06:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
task this is the province or that is the
 
06:16:13.310 --> 06:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
province and a utility scale storage is
 
06:16:16.150 --> 06:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
the province of the iso New England
 
06:16:19.270 --> 06:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
group they regulate utility production
 
06:16:24.468 --> 06:16:24.478 align:start position:0%
and storage at that scale doe does not
 
06:16:27.548 --> 06:16:27.558 align:start position:0%
we divested all our power plants all our
 
06:16:30.590 --> 06:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
power production from the utilities and
 
06:16:33.070 --> 06:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
they are now under ISO New
 
06:16:36.310 --> 06:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
England the second half for the bill
 
06:16:38.830 --> 06:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
addresses the financial regulatory
 
06:16:40.548 --> 06:16:40.558 align:start position:0%
legislative and Market hurdles or
 
06:16:43.910 --> 06:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
barriers for behind the meter customer
 
06:16:47.788 --> 06:16:47.798 align:start position:0%
energy storage so as an example and one
 
06:16:50.548 --> 06:16:50.558 align:start position:0%
was given by my colleague another might
 
06:16:53.788 --> 06:16:53.798 align:start position:0%
be you have a Charged EV or you have a
 
06:16:56.350 --> 06:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
EV charging station that's fully topped
 
06:16:59.510 --> 06:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
off how do you turn that to feed the
 
06:17:02.670 --> 06:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
grid as opposed to drawing from the grid
 
06:17:06.750 --> 06:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:09.750 --> 06:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
that is a potential legitimate area for
 
06:17:12.670 --> 06:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
study and and greater
 
06:17:15.230 --> 06:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
understanding the bill however has a
 
06:17:17.390 --> 06:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
financial note of
 
06:17:21.310 --> 06:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
$250,000 over two years if we take off
 
06:17:23.628 --> 06:17:23.638 align:start position:0%
the utility scale storage that should
 
06:17:25.910 --> 06:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
cut that in
 
06:17:29.190 --> 06:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
half uh and since it already was a doe
 
06:17:31.708 --> 06:17:31.718 align:start position:0%
mandate in previous legislation there
 
06:17:34.468 --> 06:17:34.478 align:start position:0%
may not be any need for uh additional
 
06:17:34.478 --> 06:17:36.548 align:start position:0%
may not be any need for uh additional
funding

06:17:36.548 --> 06:17:36.558 align:start position:0%
funding
 
06:17:39.510 --> 06:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
so the point now is that there is some
 
06:17:44.030 --> 06:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
Merit to this bill some has no merit
 
06:17:47.270 --> 06:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
hence I encourage you to vote for
 
06:17:49.830 --> 06:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
interim study so we can figure out what
 
06:17:53.190 --> 06:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
is useful and what isn't thank you very
 
06:17:54.390 --> 06:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
much Mr
 
06:17:56.670 --> 06:17:56.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker sen Corman has asked for a
 
06:17:58.390 --> 06:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
division members take your seats this
 
06:18:03.750 --> 06:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:03.760 --> 06:18:33.708 align:start position:0%

06:18:33.708 --> 06:18:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:30.430 --> 06:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:32.510 --> 06:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is inm study on
 
06:19:35.548 --> 06:19:35.558 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 540 this is a division
 
06:19:37.868 --> 06:19:37.878 align:start position:0%
vote chair recognized representative
 
06:19:42.070 --> 06:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:45.350 --> 06:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
empy thank you again Mr Speaker Mr
 
06:19:50.030 --> 06:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that we need to become
 
06:19:52.390 --> 06:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
less energy dependent and that batteries
 
06:19:56.110 --> 06:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
are a really good part of that
 
06:19:59.070 --> 06:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
solution and if I know that Battery
 
06:20:02.070 --> 06:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
Technology is rapidly
 
06:20:05.150 --> 06:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
evolving but that we need to stay ahead
 
06:20:07.510 --> 06:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
of it and that this bill would help us
 
06:20:10.548 --> 06:20:10.558 align:start position:0%
stay ahead of the technological changes
 
06:20:12.750 --> 06:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
then Mr Speaker would I press the red
 
06:20:16.150 --> 06:20:16.160 align:start position:0%

06:24:01.150 --> 06:24:01.160 align:start position:0%
the question all those in favor all
 
06:24:04.030 --> 06:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
right okay we got a debate chair
 
06:24:19.070 --> 06:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:23.590 --> 06:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:27.390 --> 06:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if we do not pass
 
06:24:30.310 --> 06:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
this bill New Hampshire will run out of
 
06:24:32.868 --> 06:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
numbers in the 603 area code in the next
 
06:24:35.548 --> 06:24:35.558 align:start position:0%
few years
 
06:24:39.150 --> 06:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if we do pass this bill
 
06:24:41.390 --> 06:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will run out of numbers in
 
06:24:45.230 --> 06:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
the area code 603 in the next few
 
06:24:48.230 --> 06:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
years either way we're running out of
 
06:24:51.590 --> 06:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
numbers in the 603 area code it is
 
06:24:55.230 --> 06:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
inevitable it is just not a matter of if
 
06:24:55.240 --> 06:24:56.510 align:start position:0%
inevitable it is just not a matter of if
but

06:24:56.510 --> 06:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:25:00.548 --> 06:25:00.558 align:start position:0%
when so this bill spends somewhere
 
06:25:06.628 --> 06:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
between 100,000 and 300,000 000 to try
 
06:25:09.628 --> 06:25:09.638 align:start position:0%
to delay the
 
06:25:11.910 --> 06:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
inevitable Mr Speaker I don't think this
 
06:25:14.390 --> 06:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
sounds fiscally
 
06:25:18.110 --> 06:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
responsible we'd be spending up to
 
06:25:21.390 --> 06:25:21.400 align:start position:0%
$300,000 just to Kick the Can down the
 
06:25:24.990 --> 06:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
road if we're going to spend $300,000 to
 
06:25:25.990 --> 06:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
kick a
 
06:25:29.030 --> 06:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
can we need to get someone really good
 
06:25:29.040 --> 06:25:30.430 align:start position:0%
can we need to get someone really good
at

06:25:30.430 --> 06:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
at
 
06:25:33.270 --> 06:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
kicking perhaps Mr Speaker we could get
 
06:25:38.590 --> 06:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:40.788 --> 06:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
$300,000 but I don't think this is a
 
06:25:43.430 --> 06:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
great use of our money now I understand
 
06:25:46.390 --> 06:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
that some people tie their New Hampshire
 
06:25:50.270 --> 06:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
identity into their 603 number I get
 
06:25:53.110 --> 06:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
that you know I see 603 merch all over
 
06:25:53.120 --> 06:25:54.190 align:start position:0%
that you know I see 603 merch all over
the

06:25:54.190 --> 06:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:25:56.910 --> 06:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
place suppose we get a new area code
 
06:25:58.270 --> 06:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to be what's called an
 
06:26:01.230 --> 06:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
overlay the state won't be divided in
 
06:26:03.350 --> 06:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
geographical sections the overlay will
 
06:26:06.150 --> 06:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
just be all the new numbers get the area
 
06:26:10.310 --> 06:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
codee if you like your 603 area code you
 
06:26:12.670 --> 06:26:12.680 align:start position:0%
can keep
 
06:26:15.190 --> 06:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
it so what that means is if you have a
 
06:26:19.110 --> 06:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
603 area code it shows that you're an OG
 
06:26:19.120 --> 06:26:21.070 align:start position:0%
603 area code it shows that you're an OG
Granite

06:26:21.070 --> 06:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
Granite
 
06:26:24.390 --> 06:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
stator so that's not so bad by the way
 
06:26:26.830 --> 06:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
it could get even worse in in uh
 
06:26:28.708 --> 06:26:28.718 align:start position:0%
committee we heard about the possibility
 
06:26:32.468 --> 06:26:32.478 align:start position:0%
of eventually all Us phone numbers being
 
06:26:35.468 --> 06:26:35.478 align:start position:0%
15 digits not not the 10 that we have
 
06:26:37.868 --> 06:26:37.878 align:start position:0%
now so at that point are there even area
 
06:26:40.150 --> 06:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
codes do they even make
 
06:26:44.788 --> 06:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
sense so let's not spend
 
06:26:47.430 --> 06:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
$300,000 to delay the
 
06:26:51.628 --> 06:26:51.638 align:start position:0%
inevitable and let's vote against this
 
06:26:55.510 --> 06:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr Speaker CH recognize I
 
06:26:57.708 --> 06:26:57.718 align:start position:0%
request a division vote chair recognize
 
06:27:03.150 --> 06:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:05.830 --> 06:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr
 
06:27:08.788 --> 06:27:08.798 align:start position:0%
Speaker I don't know about my colleagues
 
06:27:12.150 --> 06:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
here but I'm pretty proud of the
 
06:27:15.590 --> 06:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
603 so are our small businesses who have
 
06:27:17.948 --> 06:27:17.958 align:start position:0%
built their business and marketing on
 
06:27:19.868 --> 06:27:19.878 align:start position:0%
the 603
 
06:27:23.310 --> 06:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
trademark now we we know that there are
 
06:27:25.868 --> 06:27:25.878 align:start position:0%
numbers out there that are not being
 
06:27:29.548 --> 06:27:29.558 align:start position:0%
used do um doe is currently going
 
06:27:33.310 --> 06:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
through a process to try to reclaim some
 
06:27:36.270 --> 06:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
of those numbers but it takes time this
 
06:27:40.830 --> 06:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
bill will accelerate that process let's
 
06:27:44.110 --> 06:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
face it you know there's approximately
 
06:27:46.390 --> 06:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
what 10 million combinations out there
 
06:27:48.628 --> 06:27:48.638 align:start position:0%
there's only 1.4 million people in the
 
06:27:50.670 --> 06:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
state if you even multiply that by two
 
06:27:53.390 --> 06:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
or three devices per per per house
 
06:27:54.948 --> 06:27:54.958 align:start position:0%
there's still some numbers out there but
 
06:27:57.430 --> 06:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
they have to be reclaimed now I see
 
06:27:59.628 --> 06:27:59.638 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with trying to preserve
 
06:28:01.510 --> 06:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's identity because New
 
06:28:04.788 --> 06:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's identity is 603
 
06:28:07.750 --> 06:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
t-shirts hats uh even New Hampshire
 
06:28:10.350 --> 06:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
magazine has columns saying 603 living
 
06:28:14.910 --> 06:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
603 places you know 603 uh uh uh
 
06:28:18.070 --> 06:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
resources I mean we built our name on
 
06:28:21.590 --> 06:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
603 whatever we can do to preserve and
 
06:28:24.230 --> 06:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
extend the life of our marketing is good
 
06:28:27.070 --> 06:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
for us good for our small businesses and
 
06:28:31.150 --> 06:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
good for the identity of the state this
 
06:28:32.990 --> 06:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
process that we're doing is going to
 
06:28:35.708 --> 06:28:35.718 align:start position:0%
spend money whether we pass this bill or
 
06:28:37.910 --> 06:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
not because it's in process this bill
 
06:28:41.708 --> 06:28:41.718 align:start position:0%
will just accelerate it so I ask you all
 
06:28:44.150 --> 06:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
please pass this bill it's going to
 
06:28:46.670 --> 06:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
preserve the New Hampshire identity and
 
06:28:48.468 --> 06:28:48.478 align:start position:0%
most importantly the small businesses
 
06:28:51.590 --> 06:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
that depend on it it is worth the effort
 
06:28:55.548 --> 06:28:55.558 align:start position:0%
to do this please vote green thank you

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker I don't
 
06:36:40.030 --> 06:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
know what to make of you're choking on
 
06:36:42.150 --> 06:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
that for a moment
 
06:36:46.670 --> 06:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
but Mr Speaker if I know that only a few
 
06:36:49.548 --> 06:36:49.558 align:start position:0%
towns actually wanted this bill Mr
 
06:36:51.190 --> 06:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I further know that there's a
 
06:36:54.430 --> 06:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
process in place for re-evaluating speed
 
06:36:56.830 --> 06:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
limits where you work with do you get an

one of those towns that didn't happen
 
06:37:03.990 --> 06:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I believe the correct
 
06:37:05.868 --> 06:37:05.878 align:start position:0%
action for us today is to table this
 
06:37:07.910 --> 06:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
bill while the representatives in those
 
06:37:09.590 --> 06:37:09.600 align:start position:0%

06:37:11.830 --> 06:37:11.840 align:start position:0%

leakas thank
 
06:49:49.868 --> 06:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
you I have a friend who's very short she
 
06:49:52.230 --> 06:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
was much shorter she had to take puberty
 
06:49:54.708 --> 06:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
blockers so she could grow enough to be
 
06:49:58.310 --> 06:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
able to drive a car without special
 
06:49:58.320 --> 06:49:59.670 align:start position:0%
able to drive a car without special
pedals

06:49:59.670 --> 06:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
pedals
 
06:50:02.708 --> 06:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
Etc and so they put her on puberty block
 
06:50:05.788 --> 06:50:05.798 align:start position:0%
ERS and she grew to here but she didn't
 
06:50:07.830 --> 06:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
get any taller she wanted to stay on the
 
06:50:10.070 --> 06:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers and they said
 
06:50:12.070 --> 06:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely not they're
 
06:50:14.990 --> 06:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous just on them just the a
 
06:50:18.230 --> 06:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
minimum amount necessary and yet somehow
 
06:50:20.910 --> 06:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
magically they're not dangerous if you
 
06:50:23.548 --> 06:50:23.558 align:start position:0%
want to change your sex only if you
 
06:50:24.868 --> 06:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
actually need
 
06:50:27.830 --> 06:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
them we all know that for decades
 
06:50:30.868 --> 06:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
women's sports they did testosterone
 
06:50:35.030 --> 06:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:37.350 --> 06:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
and they would be disqualified if they
 
06:50:39.548 --> 06:50:39.558 align:start position:0%
had taken testosterone at all because it
 
06:50:41.070 --> 06:50:41.080 align:start position:0%
gave them an
 
06:50:44.750 --> 06:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
advantage and yet if somebody has gone
 
06:50:47.590 --> 06:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
through even the beginnings of
 
06:50:50.150 --> 06:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
puberty they have that Advantage if
 
06:50:53.548 --> 06:50:53.558 align:start position:0%
they're a boy but it disappears if they
 
06:50:55.388 --> 06:50:55.398 align:start position:0%
want to become a
 
06:50:58.430 --> 06:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
girl um
 
06:51:01.190 --> 06:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
also if somebody had taken the
 
06:51:03.030 --> 06:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
testosterone it gave gave them the
 
06:51:04.750 --> 06:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
advantage and then others would feel
 
06:51:07.548 --> 06:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
compelled to take it so that they would
 
06:51:10.628 --> 06:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
still be competitive and that was known
 
06:51:12.590 --> 06:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
that if you take a hormone that's
 
06:51:14.070 --> 06:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
different than your underlying
 
06:51:17.150 --> 06:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
biological sex it is harmful to your
 
06:51:19.590 --> 06:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
cells and they didn't want to encourage
 
06:51:22.548 --> 06:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
that so I want to know why we are lying
 
06:51:26.310 --> 06:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
to our kids telling them that if they do
 
06:51:28.070 --> 06:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
these things that are harmful to their
 
06:51:32.670 --> 06:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
body that they can participate in sports
 
06:51:35.590 --> 06:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
they can become opposite sex of what
 
06:51:39.830 --> 06:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
they are when your sex is determined by
 
06:51:42.670 --> 06:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
your chromosomes in every single cell of
 
06:51:42.680 --> 06:51:43.628 align:start position:0%
your chromosomes in every single cell of
your

06:51:43.628 --> 06:51:43.638 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:51:47.670 --> 06:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
body while before you're even born and
 
06:51:51.350 --> 06:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
um so you can take medications that are
 
06:51:53.628 --> 06:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
harmful for you you can mutilate your
 
06:51:57.270 --> 06:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
body but you cannot become the opposite
 
06:52:00.110 --> 06:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
sex and we keep lying and saying that
 
06:52:02.910 --> 06:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
kids can and therefore we are
 
06:52:07.350 --> 06:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
incentivizing them to do these things by
 
06:52:10.388 --> 06:52:10.398 align:start position:0%
telling boys
 
06:52:14.110 --> 06:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
who have decided to become girls that
 
06:52:16.270 --> 06:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
they can then play in girl Sports
 
06:52:19.350 --> 06:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
because they're a girl um we're
 
06:52:21.510 --> 06:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
incentivizing them to do things to their
 
06:52:23.468 --> 06:52:23.478 align:start position:0%
bodies that will be harmful for the rest
 
06:52:25.750 --> 06:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
of their
 
06:52:28.430 --> 06:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
lives if somebody wants to change their
 
06:52:31.590 --> 06:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
name their clothes their hair wear
 
06:52:34.230 --> 06:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
makeup or not wear wear makeup more
 
06:52:36.670 --> 06:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
power to
 
06:52:40.030 --> 06:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
them it it because that doesn't harm
 
06:52:43.270 --> 06:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
kids it just harm stereotypes and
 
06:52:45.708 --> 06:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
stereotypes getting rid of stereotypes
 
06:52:47.548 --> 06:52:47.558 align:start position:0%
is a good thing people should be able to
 
06:52:49.510 --> 06:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
wear whatever they want they should be
 
06:52:52.070 --> 06:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
able to dress change their names
 
06:52:57.430 --> 06:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:00.230 --> 06:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
harmful but
 
06:53:03.030 --> 06:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
using using hormones which are bad for
 
06:53:03.040 --> 06:53:04.270 align:start position:0%
using using hormones which are bad for
your

06:53:04.270 --> 06:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:53:07.910 --> 06:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
body doing things mutilating your body
 
06:53:10.708 --> 06:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
that's bad for you so instead let's
 
06:53:14.230 --> 06:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
destroy stereotypes not kids and let's
 
06:53:17.350 --> 06:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
vote for this thank you J recognize
 
06:53:17.360 --> 06:53:20.990 align:start position:0%

Simpson thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
06:53:26.468 --> 06:53:26.478 align:start position:0%
support of the interim study motion
 
06:53:27.788 --> 06:53:27.798 align:start position:0%
which have already said the house
 
06:53:31.150 --> 06:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
education committee voted 19 to1 to
 
06:53:33.990 --> 06:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
support the uh the education committee
 
06:53:36.150 --> 06:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
voted this way because this body's
 
06:53:37.830 --> 06:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
position has already been sent to the
 
06:53:40.388 --> 06:53:40.398 align:start position:0%
Senate the Senate can choose what to do
 
06:53:42.510 --> 06:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
but we've already taken a position on
 
06:53:45.270 --> 06:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
this legislation I'll just share that a
 
06:53:47.708 --> 06:53:47.718 align:start position:0%
few court cases have had rulings since I
 
06:53:51.830 --> 06:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
spoke on the floor against hb1 1205 two
 
06:53:53.948 --> 06:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
weeks ago the fourth Circuit Court of
 
06:53:56.070 --> 06:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
Appeals issued a ruling that West
 
06:53:58.628 --> 06:53:58.638 align:start position:0%
Virginia's ban on transgender girls from
 
06:54:02.510 --> 06:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
playing SP girl Sports violates Title 9
 
06:54:03.868 --> 06:54:03.878 align:start position:0%
this court is considered more
 
06:54:05.830 --> 06:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
conservative than the ninth Circuit
 
06:54:07.270 --> 06:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
Court which rules
 
06:54:10.150 --> 06:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
similarly judge Toby Hatton wrote in the
 
06:54:12.548 --> 06:54:12.558 align:start position:0%
opinion that offering a choice to a
 
06:54:14.310 --> 06:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
transgender girl between not
 
06:54:16.110 --> 06:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
participating in sports and
 
06:54:18.708 --> 06:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
participating only on boys teams is no
 
06:54:21.590 --> 06:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
real choice at all then last week
 
06:54:23.670 --> 06:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
Montana's Supreme Court ruled that the
 
06:54:26.350 --> 06:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
state law passed Banning transgender
 
06:54:28.230 --> 06:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
women athletes from playing on college
 
06:54:30.468 --> 06:54:30.478 align:start position:0%
and university women's teams was
 
06:54:30.478 --> 06:54:32.430 align:start position:0%
and university women's teams was
unconstitutional

06:54:32.430 --> 06:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
06:54:34.150 --> 06:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
I've heard colleagues in this room speak
 
06:54:36.310 --> 06:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
about how cases focused on bans that
 
06:54:38.910 --> 06:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
Target transgender teens could go before
 
06:54:41.708 --> 06:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
The Supreme Court to be clear the United
 
06:54:43.628 --> 06:54:43.638 align:start position:0%
States Supreme Court had an opportunity
 
06:54:46.190 --> 06:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
to take a case this past January
 
06:54:48.190 --> 06:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
regarding a transgender student being
 
06:54:50.590 --> 06:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
able to use a bathroom corresponding to
 
06:54:53.310 --> 06:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
his gender and they did not take the
 
06:54:56.070 --> 06:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
case instead the seventh Circuit Court
 
06:54:58.468 --> 06:54:58.478 align:start position:0%
of Appeals ruling remained and they
 
06:55:00.830 --> 06:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
found the policy violated the students
 
06:55:02.910 --> 06:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
rights under Title 9
 
06:55:04.430 --> 06:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
and equal
 
06:55:06.670 --> 06:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
protection for my colleagues who care
 
06:55:09.230 --> 06:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
about Title 9 equal protections and
 
06:55:12.548 --> 06:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
fairness this bill violates all three as
 
06:55:14.628 --> 06:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
we have seen in multiple conservative
 
06:55:17.590 --> 06:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
courts in the past few weeks we must
 
06:55:20.910 --> 06:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:23.430 --> 06:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
