00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
products containing cbd
 
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'll ask representative canuck is the
 
00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor and we'll ask him to come

forward and introduce himself and speak
 
00:03:59.029 --> 00:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much can everybody
 
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
hear me okay we can welcome to the una
 
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so yes uh this ball
 
00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
i should introduce myself i am
 
00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
representative jerry connerk i represent
 
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
carol county district 3. i also serve as
 
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
the chair of the new hampshire
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
board and i'm also a retired physician
 
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
now the issue is that there was a really
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
rapidly expanding market for cbd
 
00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
containing products you see them all
 
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
over the place gas stations and
 
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
everywhere but the problem is that cbd
 
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
products are unregulated
 
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
and this market's a little reminiscent
 
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
of snake oil salesman of old
 
00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
now cbd is one of the active components
 
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
in cannabis it's not so psychoactive
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
like thc but it does have
 
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
pharmacological effects it's currently
 
00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
not regulated at the state level and
 
00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
there's only minimal regulation at the
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
the major problem for a consumer who
 
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
wants to buy cbd is that there's no
 
00:04:54.549 --> 00:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
requirements for testing or labeling the
 
00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:55.510 align:start position:0%
requirements for testing or labeling the
product

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
um in the past some random testing of
 
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
cbd products has been done that
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrates gross inaccuracies from the
 
00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
concentration of cbd from what was
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
stated on the label sometimes with
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
essentially no cbd in their product at
 
00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
all contamination of their product with
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
pesticides and heavy metals and mold can
 
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
occur and will not be known to the
 
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
consumer if the product is not tested so
 
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to regulate cbd products
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
for retail sale
 
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
with the goal of consumer protection and
 
00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
safety by ensuring the accurate label of
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
the contents of the product and a
 
00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
product free of contaminants along with
 
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate warning labels particularly
 
00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
with regard to pregnancy lactation and
 
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
use in children
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
a certificate of analysis would be on
 
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
the label or traceable from the label
 
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
and the testing of labeling requirements
 
00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
are modeled on the product testing that
 
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
we do in the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
program also from trade organization
 
00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:49.839 align:start position:0%
recommendations and we also modeled some
 
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
of this after vermont law
 
00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
now this product is a this bill is a
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
product of the 2019 hemp study
 
00:05:58.549 --> 00:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on which i served
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
with representatives pearl and bixby the
 
00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
2018 farm bill removes him from the de
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
schedule one where cannabis resides and
 
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
allows sale of him products but the thc
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
content cannot exceed 0.3 percent in
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
order to be compliant
 
00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
the fda does allow sale of products
 
00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
including oil as long as it is not added
 
00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
to food or sold with a health claim but
 
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
the fda doesn't really regulate cbd or
 
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.150 align:start position:0%
the fda doesn't really regulate cbd or
label

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
label
 
00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
so though the fda prohibits the addition
 
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
of cbd to food on a federal level a
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
state can override that if desired but
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
there cannot be any transport across
 
00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
state lines of food products with cbd
 
00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:39.349 align:start position:0%
state lines of food products with cbd
added

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
added
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
foods containing cbd should be labeled
 
00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
because a consumer should have the right
 
00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
to know how much cbd they are consuming
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
in a food or drink to allow them to
 
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
consume what they perceive as a
 
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
therapeutic dose while avoiding
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
unintentional overdose
 
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
i introduced this bill last year as
 
00:06:59.190 --> 00:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
hb1581 in in the commerce and consumer
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
affairs committee
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
and in the original version of the bill
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
i split the work between dhhs and damf
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
but it soon became abundantly clear that
 
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
damf did not really want anything to do
 
00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
and we couldn't work out the kinks very
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
well and so it was sent to interim study
 
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
and then in the fall recommended for
 
00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
future legislation with the revisions
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
that i had worked on uh to make the bill
 
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
a little cleaner
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
when i rewrote the bill this year i cut
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
out dams and put it entirely in dhhs
 
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
which is where it actually fits better
 
00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
because it has to do with a
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
pharmacologically active compound and
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
cbd is added to food so food safety
 
00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
which is in dhhs gets involved
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
i sent all of you a link to the bill
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
which you of course have but also an
 
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.390 align:start position:0%
which you of course have but also an
amendment

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
and i should say i submitted this way
 
00:07:50.549 --> 00:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
back in september it was very slow
 
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
getting out the final version which
 
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
didn't come out until december 27
 
00:07:57.349 --> 00:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
um and the there still are a few
 
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
grammatical errors and a few minor input
 
00:08:01.829 --> 00:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
from stakeholders that developed after
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
the lsr sign off
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
so for ease of understanding the
 
00:08:07.349 --> 00:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
drafting attorney structured the
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
amendment as a replacement of the two
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
sections so i gave in what i sent to you
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
a roadmap how you can toggle back and
 
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
forth between the bill and the amendment
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
so that you can follow it easily because
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
i know it can often be a bit confusing
 
00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
and i gave it to you a few days ago so
 
00:08:23.349 --> 00:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
you could look at it
 
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
now i don't want to go through every
 
00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
single bit of it but just to go over
 
00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
that in the first part of the bill
 
00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh it simply talks about the issues of
 
00:08:32.319 --> 00:08:33.189 align:start position:0%
uh it simply talks about the issues of
um

00:08:33.189 --> 00:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know the hemp and food and so on and
 
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
so forth and then in the
 
00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh and this in the testing how the
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
testing is uh the testing needs to be
 
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
done and how testing lab laboratories
 
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
are approved and then the amendment is
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
where we go to cover all the labeling
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
issues because there were a few things
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
that changed there and then back to the
 
00:08:54.789 --> 00:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
bill and i gave the line numbers for
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
that which covers the
 
00:08:58.789 --> 00:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
registration fees and rule making
 
00:08:58.799 --> 00:08:59.910 align:start position:0%
registration fees and rule making
um

00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
if people want i can go over those lines
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
right now but well maybe i should
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
beginning through page two line seven is
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
then you go to the amendment that's
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
lines three to twenty five that's the
 
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.030 align:start position:0%
lines three to twenty five that's the
labeling

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
labeling
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
then go back to the bill page two line
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
twenty nine through page three line
 
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.229 align:start position:0%
twenty nine through page three line
eight

00:09:18.229 --> 00:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:09:20.149 --> 00:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
again this is all in my testimony that
 
00:09:21.749 --> 00:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
covers the registration the fees and the
 
00:09:23.669 --> 00:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
rulemaking then you go back to the
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
amendment for lines 29 to 31
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
to authorize an inspector and then
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
return back to the bill for page 3 line
 
00:09:32.309 --> 00:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
12 that's the effective date
 
00:09:34.149 --> 00:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
now many of these changes are rather
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
minor what it amounts to is for example
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
in the labeling uh
 
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
the oral tincture it was all written as
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
milligrams of cbd per milliliter which
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
didn't work for pills and capsules had
 
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
to segregate that out there was
 
00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
correction of a
 
00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
punctuation mark and point number three
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
of their product labeling
 
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
and then the one real addition
 
00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
is the addition of a link to the
 
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
certificate of analysis using a qr code
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
or a website from the label
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
and the last one it was just changing
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
the word and
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
a to and because of a grammatical
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
inconsistency so most of the things on
 
00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment are are really just
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
corrections of
 
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
grammatical errors other than the qr
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
label so the bill pretty much is the the
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
whole thing now the bottom line is that
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
you'll also be hearing from
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
representatives of the cbd industry who
 
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
support the bill uh particularly given
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
the inaction of the fda um in my
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
testimony i put a segment of what the
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
national products
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
association uh submitted last year in
 
00:10:38.229 --> 00:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
their testimony but i think they're
 
00:10:41.189 --> 00:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
going to be here but they did state that
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
they still wish the fda would work on
 
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
this and move forward but since they
 
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
don't they're supportive of state
 
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.990 align:start position:0%
don't they're supportive of state
standards

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
so in summary the cbd industry wants
 
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
this regulation to project to protect i
 
00:10:55.669 --> 00:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
should say legitimate companies and we
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
need this regulation to perfect protect
 
00:10:59.830 --> 00:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
public health especially with regard to
 
00:11:01.669 --> 00:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
children and pregnant and lactating
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
mothers and our citizens deserve this
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
regulation to know what they're
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
consuming and be given appropriate
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
safety and health warnings when they buy
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
cbd in new hampshire
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
now a couple things that are some
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
controversies that i became aware of
 
00:11:16.149 --> 00:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
only in the last couple of days from
 
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
some stakeholders that i wish to just
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
bring your attention to because you will
 
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
hear this testimony
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
if you do look at the amendment
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
and you do look at the labeling
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
you will see that there is a comment in
 
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.229 align:start position:0%
you will see that there is a comment in
there

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
on point three that talks about the fda
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
advising that during pregnancy and
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding you avoid using cbd and
 
00:11:36.709 --> 00:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
that there's no approval for use of cbd
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
and children except by prescription for
 
00:11:41.669 --> 00:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
severe seizure disorder
 
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
the language that i used about pregnancy
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
and breastfeeding is taken from the fda
 
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
industry people feels that's a little
 
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
too strong the fda approval for houston
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
children remember that
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
i also serve as the chair of therapeutic
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board we have
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
suspen spent a substantial amount of the
 
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
last year working on the question of
 
00:12:06.229 --> 00:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
any cannabis in
 
00:12:06.239 --> 00:12:07.189 align:start position:0%
any cannabis in
children

00:12:07.189 --> 00:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
in pregnancy and lactation and we've
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
covered that and come up with our
 
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations because there is another
 
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
bill going through that has to do with
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh warning signs for that even in
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
00:12:22.149 --> 00:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
so this simply echoes and mirrors that
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
one of the other concerns
 
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.350 align:start position:0%
one of the other concerns
um

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
that was brought up by one of the uh
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
advocates or for the uh not advocate
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
lobbyists for the national industry
 
00:12:35.669 --> 00:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
is a disagreement about whether or not
 
00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:36.550 align:start position:0%
is a disagreement about whether or not
food

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
food
 
00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
that contains cbd can cross state lines
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that you still
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
cannot cross state lines with food which
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
is why in the first page it says that
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
any food any food product that contains
 
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
cbd must be formulated within the state
 
00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
you can move cbd oil across state lines
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
but not food is my understanding we do
 
00:12:58.950 --> 00:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
have colleen smith from department of
 
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
health and human services food
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
safety who will be able to clarify that
 
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
for us
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
and the last thing is i got a note an
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
email from another stakeholder
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting we put in language saying
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
that the lab
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
that does the measurements would be an
 
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
iso iec
 
00:13:20.229 --> 00:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
17025 accredited lab
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
um actually in the hemp study committee
 
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
we did hear from a lab that was
 
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
accredited from maine about how they do
 
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.669 align:start position:0%
accredited from maine about how they do
theirs

00:13:27.669 --> 00:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
theirs
 
00:13:29.669 --> 00:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
that was pretty straightforward i should
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
note that in the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
statutory language rsa 126x
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in there about the
 
00:13:40.709 --> 00:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
needing to have that particular
 
00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
certification it is understood that it
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
would be a certified lab and i would
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
assume that if this program goes forward
 
00:13:49.669 --> 00:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
since it is in dhhs
 
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
that the approval of the lab which has
 
00:13:53.669 --> 00:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
to be done by dhhs would follow very
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
much the same rules they would again use
 
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
an accredited lab
 
00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
because there is a problem with
 
00:14:00.229 --> 00:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
fly-by-night labs they do need to be an
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
accredited lab
 
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
so it was too late to put the language
 
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
in i'm not sure we need it we don't have
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
it in therapeutic cannabis and i think
 
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
we can trust dhhs that they will use an
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
accredited lab so that can be taken care
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
of in rulemaking i think i don't need to
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
go any further except to be available to
 
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
ask you for you to ask me questions
 
00:14:20.709 --> 00:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
presentation very thorough
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
all right so i know this bill is a
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
little bit complex for some
 
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
do uh does anybody have any questions
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
you do all right representative mohler
 
00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
i'll start with you thank you
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
sir thank you for coming in today to
 
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
testify and thank you for taking my
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
question a question i did have is that i
 
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
see that there is a registration fee of
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
100 per product and that registration
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
fee gets
 
00:14:51.669 --> 00:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
assessed every year can you tell me what
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
that where you came up with that hundred
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
that fee is to try to make the program
 
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.830 align:start position:0%
that fee is to try to make the program
self-sustaining

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
the model that after some of the other
 
00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
registration things that i know you have
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
in environment and agriculture because
 
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
actually it was a
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
fact uh there's representative bixby and
 
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
i were down there working together with
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
the drafting attorney last year on this
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
um or year before or whatever to try to
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
get some language and at that point we
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
said 75 we up to 200 and made sure it
 
00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
was per product not per company and the
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
idea is it's that money which will be
 
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
able to fund the position for the
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
inspector um and the program itself it
 
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
will take a little time to get it off
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
the ground but the idea is to make this
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
turn my mic back on thank you uh
 
00:15:48.709 --> 00:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
representative aaron did you have a
 
00:15:48.719 --> 00:15:50.229 align:start position:0%
representative aaron did you have a
question

00:15:50.229 --> 00:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
yes sure um thank you very much and
 
00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for uh for
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
00:15:58.229 --> 00:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
and presenting this
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
um my question is um
 
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
what is
 
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
do you have an idea of what this is
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
going to cost any an average producer
 
00:16:10.149 --> 00:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
for testing
 
00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
i mean they've gotta they've got to do
 
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.630 align:start position:0%
i mean they've gotta they've got to do
this

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.070 align:start position:0%
this
testing

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.910 align:start position:0%
testing
and

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:17.669 --> 00:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to get an idea of what
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's gonna cost uh you know the
 
00:16:22.149 --> 00:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
producers of these products
 
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
and how often do they have to test them
 
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for that question
 
00:16:30.229 --> 00:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
basically it would be each each lot or
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
each batch that which would be tested um
 
00:16:34.709 --> 00:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
as far as the cost actually i'm sorry i
 
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
do not know the answer to that question
 
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
i will say the following um
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
these are already rather pricey products
 
00:16:45.669 --> 00:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
to begin with they are so i don't think
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to make a big difference if
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
you wander in your local health food
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
store to try to pick up a
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps 60
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
milliliter bottle of cbd oil you're
 
00:16:55.669 --> 00:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
going to find that it's going to cost
 
00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
you somewhere around 30 or even 40
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
dollars so there is a pretty high profit
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
margin on this already i don't think
 
00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
this is going to be an enormous problem
 
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
and actually any of these producers
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
should be testing their materials
 
00:17:12.149 --> 00:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
for toxins heavy metals
 
00:17:14.149 --> 00:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
and molds and also to be sure that what
 
00:17:16.229 --> 00:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
they claim they're doing is correct plus
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
to comply with the fda the uh thc has to
 
00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
be less than 0.3
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
so i do not know exactly how much that
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative davis did you have your
 
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
hand up before or did i okay i'm sorry i
 
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
thought i saw that all right uh
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative verville if you can
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
unmute yourself
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh mr chairman and uh
 
00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kenner for
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you were talking
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
about dosage
 
00:17:52.709 --> 00:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
and uh and potential overdose so i was
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could tell us what the
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
typical adult dose would be
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
what the size of an overdose for an
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
adult the average adult would be and if
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
you have any data on the ld50
 
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.189 align:start position:0%
you have any data on the ld50
okay

00:18:09.189 --> 00:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
actually you know i meant to actually
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
look that up for you because i
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
what we the one drug we have actual good
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
dosage data on
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
is epidiolex and in epidiolex uh the the
 
00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
dosage i should say also what is the
 
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
toxicity there are a couple of
 
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
toxicities one of which is liver
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
disease and that's why the dose has to
 
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
be adjusted a wee bit if somebody has
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
liver disease um
 
00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
but the doses are actually in the orders
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
of hundreds of milligrams i actually
 
00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
just happened to have it took me a
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
moment here to get there
 
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.750 align:start position:0%
moment here to get there
um

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
the yeah the doses are actually in the
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
order of hundreds of milligrams it's uh
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
the maintenance dose for a child and
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
which is the usual person who takes this
 
00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
for seizure disorder 10 milligrams per
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
kilograms per day so if you had a 50
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
kilogram adult you'd be talking about
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
500 milligrams per day as a normal dose
 
00:19:06.149 --> 00:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
now the point is that
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
the the person taking this in a small
 
00:19:10.709 --> 00:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
amount is likely to take very little you
 
00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
take a dropper full of a cbd oil which
 
00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
is what's often recommended it's about
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
10 mils you may be 20 mils and you might
 
00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
take that a few times a day the time you
 
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
would start worrying about toxicity is
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
if you have a little bit in your morning
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
coffee you have some more in your muffin
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
you have a little more in your afternoon
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
snack you have some in your beer you
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
also take a little bit on your own from
 
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
your cbd oil you could conceivably begin
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
to get a little higher um i think it's a
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
relatively small risk that a person
 
00:19:40.149 --> 00:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
consuming it would get into the toxic
 
00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
range but it's not an impossibility and
 
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
if you have liver disease the dose has
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
has to be adjusted down and that person
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
would be more sensitive to it and that
 
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
could be a little bit of a problem
 
00:19:54.709 --> 00:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
so that's that's really the concern i
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
actually had
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
personally some recommendations about
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
having cbd and food um but i was out
 
00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
voted by representatives bixby and uh
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
and pearl and so we did vote to go ahead
 
00:20:08.229 --> 00:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
and put that in and i'm perfectly
 
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
comfortable with as long as it's labeled
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
so people have some sense what they're
 
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.390 align:start position:0%
so people have some sense what they're
getting

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question well
 
00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:15.110 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question well
enough

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:20:18.709 --> 00:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
yeah uh well a follow-up if i can um so
 
00:20:20.229 --> 00:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
an over-the-counter product
 
00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
so we're not really talking about
 
00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh pharmaceutical dosages is that that's
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
correct right
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
yes again i think in the normal dose
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
that somebody would take
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
that should be not a problem it would
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
only be as i said if they
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
happened to take some on their own from
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
some cbd oil plus all day long they kept
 
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
chowing down on a little bit more in
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
there as to say in their morning coffee
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
their muffin their their beer because it
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
gets added just about anything you darn
 
00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
well could think of gets cbd added to it
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
so uh there could conceivably be a
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
problem particularly if it were a
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
thinner smaller person if it were a
 
00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
person with liver disease but it's not
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
likely that's why that's not an enormous
 
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
concern in terms of the toxicity but the
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
issue is
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's the liver toxicity or some of the
 
00:21:11.189 --> 00:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
other big toxicities
 
00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
it can have some other toxicities though
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
um some of its therapeutic effects
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
things like potentially some help in
 
00:21:18.159 --> 00:21:19.350 align:start position:0%
things like potentially some help in
anxiety

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
anxiety
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh insomnia but we also know that some
 
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
of these drugs in larger doses can cause
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
anxiety and so we have some difficulty
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
going back and forth between
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
not we actually bottom line is we don't
 
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
have enough data about some of this to
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
really know
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
exactly what kind of long-term issues
 
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
there may be with underlying medical
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
problems such as
 
00:21:42.709 --> 00:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
psychiatric illness we know that
 
00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
whole plant cannabis has very distinct
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
issues and somebody with underlying
 
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.590 align:start position:0%
issues and somebody with underlying
psychiatric

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
psychiatric
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
problems or
 
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
in the developing brain which by the way
 
00:21:53.189 --> 00:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
is the reason for the warning about
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
children and also the reason for the
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
warning about pregnancy and lactation
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
because we do not have enough data in
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative just one
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
last question if i could mr chairman
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
sure follow up yeah thank you so
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
just going down the line
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative kanark you had
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
indicated that these are high margin uh
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
products and i was wondering if you
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
could tell us what the average margin on
 
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
these products is and
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
where you acquired that data
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i probably shouldn't have used
 
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
the word margin but they it's quite
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
profitable and i remember that
 
00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative bixby presented some
 
00:22:38.629 --> 00:22:38.639 align:start position:0%
information to us in our hemp study
 
00:22:40.709 --> 00:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
committee regarding the profitability on
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
growing an acre of hemp for fiber versus
 
00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
for oil and the oil is generates quite a
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
bit of income
 
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.790 align:start position:0%
bit of income
so

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's possible actually uh representative
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
bixby on your committee may be able to
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
even answer that question better because
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
i've forgotten that detail
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
but you're right i should not have used
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
the word margin my error
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:23:08.229 --> 00:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
all right so i've lost my screen there
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
for a second
 
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative murray is our has
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
her hand raised do you have a question
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
for representative kenner
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
i do mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
question representative connerk so i did
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
have a question with regard to items
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
that were topical in nature do you have
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
similar concerns with those or is this
 
00:23:30.229 --> 00:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
just ingestible
 
00:23:30.239 --> 00:23:32.629 align:start position:0%
just ingestible
products

00:23:32.629 --> 00:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's primarily the ingestibles and the
 
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
reason for that is the absorption of the
 
00:23:40.229 --> 00:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
topicals is relatively poor and i also
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
need to clarify when you say ingestible
 
00:23:45.189 --> 00:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
that actually is a little bit um there's
 
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's a mixed issue
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
is the primary way you can get rapid
 
00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
absorption and effective absorption is
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
through the mucosa that's the lining of
 
00:23:55.189 --> 00:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
the mouth so you put it under your
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
tongue and you hold it there for a while
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
and this applies to just about any
 
00:24:01.189 --> 00:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
medicine the fastest way to get it in is
 
00:24:01.199 --> 00:24:02.470 align:start position:0%
medicine the fastest way to get it in is
inhalation

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
inhalation
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
through either smoking or vaporization
 
00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
we don't do that with cbd
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
the second fastest is the
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
sublingual or belief the tongue root
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
where it's against the
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
mucosa if you swallow it
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
you get what we call a first pass effect
 
00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
and that is a lot of it is
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
because the way the digestion works it
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
goes into the portal vein system goes to
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
liver and much of it is broken down
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
before it even gets to the body so we
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
lose some when we take it orally and the
 
00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
absorption is likewise slower when it's
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
taken orally and certainly much less
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
effective topically it's the least
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
effective way of getting anything into
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
your bloodstream there may be some local
 
00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
effects because it is lipophilic it
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
likes fat it will transfer through
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
but there are so maybe some local but
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
the systemic issues are a great deal
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
less when it's topical again though it
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
is important that at least the consumer
 
00:24:54.709 --> 00:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
might have some idea of just how much
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
cbd is in it if they want to compare two
 
00:25:00.229 --> 00:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:25:04.709 --> 00:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh let's see next we have representative
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
bixby has his hand up
 
00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman for taking my
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative knurk
 
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.430 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative knurk
um

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.310 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.430 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.709 align:start position:0%
uh
the

00:25:18.709 --> 00:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
reading the bill it looks like the
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
funding for the inspector and for
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
getting uh and for running the program
 
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.030 align:start position:0%
getting uh and for running the program
is

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
going to be coming through the
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
registration fees but
 
00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering
 
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
those won't be kind of those won't be
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
coming in at the outset of the program
 
00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't see funding for
 
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
getting the program up and running uh
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
how is that going to work
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
actually um that is a point which i
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
we did not address
 
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
and i just i just became aware of it in
 
00:25:54.229 --> 00:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
a conversation with the therapeutic
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
canvas director about 10 minutes before
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
this phone call they will be testifying
 
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
that they do need some startup money i
 
00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
do not know how much they would need
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
it's a relatively small program
 
00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
so the question would be
 
00:26:10.629 --> 00:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not this would need a small
 
00:26:12.709 --> 00:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
appropriation to go into the budget
 
00:26:14.709 --> 00:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
i i would anticipate it would not
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
require very much since it's a modest
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
number of providers or i mean
 
00:26:22.709 --> 00:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
companies that do it and a modest number
 
00:26:24.629 --> 00:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
of products that are actually going to
 
00:26:24.639 --> 00:26:25.430 align:start position:0%
of products that are actually going to
be

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
um registered but you're right there
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
will be a lag time it should be
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
eventually self-funding but there will
 
00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
be some startup costs
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
and i did not see a fiscal note which i
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
was actually a little surprised about i
 
00:26:41.189 --> 00:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
thought we would get that from them
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
and may i have a follow-up mr chair
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:26:46.709 --> 00:26:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh so this is actually sort of a
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up on uh representative murray's
 
00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:26:53.189 --> 00:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
even though
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
the the the potential dosage for through
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
a topical uh cbd
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
you get a lot less transferred um
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we still want to protect
 
00:27:12.709 --> 00:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
consumers by um ascertaining that
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
what the producer said was in it was
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
still in it
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
yes that's why that would still be
 
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
labeled uh all products would be labeled
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
and um inside in on page 2 line 12 and
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
13 if it's a product that is not an oral
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
tincture pill or capsule it's the amount
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
of milligrams per serving or milligrams
 
00:27:34.709 --> 00:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
per milliliter so we have some way to
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
measure that but it is important to
 
00:27:39.189 --> 00:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
realize as i say this has to do with the
 
00:27:41.189 --> 00:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
systemic toxicity will be less with the
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
topicals but this bill would say every
 
00:27:45.189 --> 00:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
product has to be labeled
 
00:27:48.709 --> 00:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
okay and uh one more follow-up
 
00:27:48.719 --> 00:27:50.149 align:start position:0%
okay and uh one more follow-up
yes

00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.709 align:start position:0%
uh so
um

00:27:52.709 --> 00:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
you work with the um
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
the medical marijuana commission also
 
00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
and i i believe that there are
 
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.229 align:start position:0%
and i i believe that there are
uh

00:28:02.229 --> 00:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
there's some cbd that is uh
 
00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
also part of that program and i'm
 
00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's any chemical
 
00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
distinction between
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
the cbd that would be derived from
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana versus from hemp
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
no a cbd is cbd it doesn't matter
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
because well remember the two plants are
 
00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
nearly identical i mean they're both the
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
same uh
 
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
they're essentially the same plant it's
 
00:28:30.229 --> 00:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
just a matter of low thc but the cbd is
 
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
the same cannabidiol is cannabidiol
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
regardless which it came from even if
 
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.270 align:start position:0%
regardless which it came from even if
we're

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.709 align:start position:0%
we're
synthesized

00:28:36.709 --> 00:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
synthesized
 
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
but the therapeutic cannabis program of
 
00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
course has a very different level of
 
00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
barriers to getting involved you have to
 
00:28:44.629 --> 00:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
certify as a patient because of having a
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
qualifying condition and then you do go
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
to the uh
 
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
atc and you can get
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
compounds which may be cbd predominant
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
and that is sometimes and fairly often
 
00:28:58.390 --> 00:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
used for certain indications within the
 
00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program the issue
 
00:29:02.229 --> 00:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
at this point is you know when i when i
 
00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
go up route 93 and get off at 104 at the
 
00:29:06.629 --> 00:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
exit there to drive home back in the
 
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
days when i used to go down there uh you
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
go right into that rest stop or the gas
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
station and they have big signs for
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
selling your cbd you can buy cbd just
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
about everywhere currently and that's
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
the concern
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
by the way there is also a statement in
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
the bill which which exempts the
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program from any of
 
00:29:29.189 --> 00:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
these regulations which makes sense
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
because they're a separate program
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
oh and just the for the question that
 
00:29:36.229 --> 00:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
you weren't able to answer in terms of
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
the the relative amounts
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
for cbd versus fiber
 
00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh the fiber was to
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
this was two years ago but the fiber was
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
about 75 dollars per acre and the cbd
 
00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
was about
 
00:29:52.629 --> 00:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
750 per acre
 
00:29:52.639 --> 00:29:54.550 align:start position:0%
750 per acre
right

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.350 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
any

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
oh we have some more hands up do we have
 
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
any questions in the room
 
00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
paying attention to the computer here
 
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative verville looks like you
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative verville you're muted
 
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:18.709 align:start position:0%
representative verville you're muted
still

00:30:18.709 --> 00:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
i can see you talking but we're not able
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
ah there we go sorry yeah had the dub
 
00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:30.400 align:start position:0%

and and thank you representative bixby i
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
i understand that you know we got a
 
00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
selling price per acre but i'm not sure
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
that that translates into realized
 
00:30:46.709 --> 00:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
profits uh but my my real question is
 
00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
do we have data on the last 12 24 or 36
 
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.430 align:start position:0%
do we have data on the last 12 24 or 36
months

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
of how many people
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
have been you know either admitted or
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
treated for overdose or negative effects
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
from uh consuming too much cbd in new
 
00:31:03.679 --> 00:31:05.910 align:start position:0%
from uh consuming too much cbd in new
hampshire

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:05.920 align:start position:0%

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:07.920 align:start position:0%

represent please sell latency we can't
 
00:31:18.229 --> 00:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
hear this
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
i don't have any evidence sorry any data
 
00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
regarding uh numbers and again some of
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
these are not going to be necessary
 
00:31:26.629 --> 00:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
somebody who gets overtly ill
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
for example some mild liver dysfunction
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
would be something you might not know
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
about until a period of time or may show
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
up when you get some labs and nobody
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
would even necessarily know which is why
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
there's a recommendation if you're going
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
to take it you would discuss or if
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
you're taking medication you discuss
 
00:31:47.189 --> 00:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
this with your primary care provider
 
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about overdoses like
 
00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
opioids it's not something where
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to stop breathing
 
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
there are no cannabinoid receptors in
 
00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
the brain stem so it does not affect
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
breathing so that's not really a concern
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
but there are other medical effects if
 
00:32:04.629 --> 00:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
you have too much of a medication
 
00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
including for example it has an
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
interaction with
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
statins if you take uh torvastatin or
 
00:32:12.709 --> 00:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
pravastatin for a high cholesterol
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
the cbd is metabolized with the same set
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
of enzymes as is your statin and if you
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
start taking cbd your statin dose
 
00:32:23.189 --> 00:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
effectively will go up even though you
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
haven't changed the dose the blood level
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
go up and that has significant side
 
00:32:28.709 --> 00:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
effects so the point is it is
 
00:32:31.189 --> 00:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
pharmacologically active and but it's
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
not something where we're talking about
 
00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
overdoses like opioids or people are
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
going to drop dead that's not the issue
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
all right we have uh representative
 
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
murray has her hand raised again
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative murray do you have
 
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
another question
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
yes i do thank you mr chair thank you uh
 
00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
rep knight for taking my question uh
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
with regard to page two lines one
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
through four
 
00:32:56.709 --> 00:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
my question was with
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
obtaining that certificate of testing
 
00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
for the pesticides metals solvents etc
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
if if a purchaser
 
00:33:06.709 --> 00:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
does not have access to a phone or an
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
internet is there a document on file at
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
a point of sale within a retail
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
establishment that they can get that is
 
00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
that the intent
 
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.950 align:start position:0%
that the intent
actually

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
that is not part of this bill
 
00:33:23.189 --> 00:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
the it would be through either a qr code
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
or a website so i would think that
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
i may have to confess i didn't start
 
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
using qr codes just a couple of years
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
ago myself but the website would be
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
there so they could track it down to a
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
website the rare person who does not
 
00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
have any excess
 
00:33:38.229 --> 00:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
whatsoever could certainly ask someone
 
00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
else for help if they wish to do this
 
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
but i think it'd be a little bit more
 
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
burdensome on all of the
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
retail outlets if we ask them to have
 
00:33:52.709 --> 00:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:33:57.189 --> 00:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
representative bixby has his hand
 
00:33:59.189 --> 00:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
and i guess i don't unless it didn't go
 
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
down representative bixby you want to be
 
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
recognized again yes i am i audible
 
00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.070 align:start position:0%
recognized again yes i am i audible
yes

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you mr chairman for taking
 
00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
my question um so i just wanted to
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh get a little bit clear of
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
clarification since some of the
 
00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
discussion has been
 
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.350 align:start position:0%
discussion has been
uh

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
whether the uh having the
 
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.430 align:start position:0%
whether the uh having the
um

00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
the dosage and the uh the amount
 
00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
contained listed
 
00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
is uh an issue of trying to prevent
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
overdoses and
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
my impression was that um that's
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's a smaller part of it than
 
00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.629 align:start position:0%
that's a smaller part of it than
uh

00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
the fraud prevention end where someone
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
may be labeling a
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
vial of cbd as having a lot in it and it
 
00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.390 align:start position:0%
vial of cbd as having a lot in it and it
has

00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh little or none
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
and being able to sell it without any
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
sort of um consequences
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
yeah is that that is correct
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct i mean it's really
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
multiple things it is for consumer
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
protection that you are actually going
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to purchase what you think
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
you're purchasing because indeed that's
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
why the um
 
00:35:09.189 --> 00:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
the product the industries the national
 
00:35:11.669 --> 00:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
products association likes this because
 
00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
they want to protect the legitimate
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
businesses and
 
00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
get rid of the fly-by-nights that are
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
just putting out
 
00:35:20.149 --> 00:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
some oils that don't really have
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
anything in it the second thing was that
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
warning for the more susceptible groups
 
00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
of pregnancy
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
lactation and kids and the third piece
 
00:35:31.189 --> 00:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
again the toxicity but as i mentioned to
 
00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative verville it's a very
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
small issue in terms
 
00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
that's a much lesser issue in my mind
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's just a piece that's there the risk
 
00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.590 align:start position:0%
it's just a piece that's there the risk
of

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
getting toxicity again it's not an acute
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
toxicity it'd probably be more of a
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
chronic toxicity um by taking too much
 
00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
but i do acknowledge that is the lesser
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
of all of the things the major is for
 
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and protection of
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
little kids and pregnant women lactating
 
00:36:01.669 --> 00:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative aaron i'll recognize you
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.709 --> 00:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
thank you again uh representative for uh
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm just a little concerned about um
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
the costs for the producers especially
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
when they've been looking at producers
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know smaller in nature
 
00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
because the registration costs and
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
testing costs those fees can mount up
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i just feel like um
 
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
you know this might be cost prohibitive
 
00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
for smaller companies
 
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
and smaller producers and i'd like kind
 
00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
of your uh
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on that
 
00:36:51.189 --> 00:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
okay i think actually i know that we
 
00:36:53.669 --> 00:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
have a couple of people that are from
 
00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
the industry that are on this call who
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
plan to testify
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
and perhaps this better thing would be
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
to ask them first of all i would presume
 
00:37:02.709 --> 00:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
that for many of them they probably have
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
to do the testing for other states as
 
00:37:08.229 --> 00:37:08.239 align:start position:0%
well so if they are producing
 
00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
and because some of them are larger if
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
they are producing they would be able to
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
the same testing would work for any
 
00:37:15.669 --> 00:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
number of states
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
and in terms of registration
 
00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:18.629 align:start position:0%
and in terms of registration
i

00:37:18.629 --> 00:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
i i don't know and that's why i would
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
say let's ask the industry people they
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
can give you a sense about that one
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:37:26.629 --> 00:37:26.639 align:start position:0%

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representatives i

don't see any more hands or any further
 
00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:32.159 align:start position:0%

00:37:32.159 --> 00:37:34.149 align:start position:0%
questions so we appreciate your uh

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
regards to the smaller participants
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to first say thank you
 
00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.390 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to first say thank you
for

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
all the work that's gone into this bill
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's very clear um the focus on consumer
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
protection but at the same time creating
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
a robust market and also thank you for
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak with you today
 
00:38:49.189 --> 00:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
with regards to this bill
 
00:38:49.199 --> 00:38:49.910 align:start position:0%
with regards to this bill
my

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:38:51.669 --> 00:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
largest concern has to do with the
 
00:38:54.709 --> 00:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
restriction on interstate commerce
 
00:38:58.070 --> 00:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce is is not regulated
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh by individual states it's not
 
00:39:02.709 --> 00:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
regulated by the fda it's not regulated
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
by the usda however
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
in the most recent interim final rules
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
from the usda which um they were
 
00:39:12.149 --> 00:39:12.159 align:start position:0%
produced on the 19th of this month they
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
did offer up guidance as to how to
 
00:39:17.669 --> 00:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
handle interstate commerce so um that
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
guidance is readily available
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
there is no federal prohibition
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
on interstate commerce with regards to
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
cbd and hemp in fact the interpretation
 
00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
that there is is um
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
definitely an anomaly when you look at
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
the interpretation that we've seen
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
across the country with the other states
 
00:39:40.629 --> 00:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
so again per the most recent usda
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
interim final rules they give guidance
 
00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.229 align:start position:0%
interim final rules they give guidance
on

00:39:44.229 --> 00:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
how to conduct interstate commerce of
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
hemp and hemp products
 
00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.669 align:start position:0%
hemp and hemp products
also

00:39:51.669 --> 00:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
something to consider is the fact that
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
federally this issue is is being
 
00:39:58.149 --> 00:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
discussed the labeling issue um how it's
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
going to proceed um there's a bill that
 
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
i recommend you all take a look at is hr
 
00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.990 align:start position:0%
i recommend you all take a look at is hr
8179

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
8179
 
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
it is the hemp and hemp derived cbd
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and market
 
00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
facilitation act and the intention is
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
for uh cbd to be and cannabinoid
 
00:40:18.709 --> 00:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
medicine or cannabinoids i should say to
 
00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
be regulated like a dietary supplement
 
00:40:24.229 --> 00:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
and i think that'll clarify a lot of the
 
00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
questions that we have today and um
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
that's another reason why i would ask
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
that section two
 
00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
he's struck and out where you are
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
putting a restriction on interstate
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
commerce which isn't within the
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
authority of individual states or the
 
00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
fda or the usda um with regards to our
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
roadways and our waterways
 
00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
again when you look at the industry and
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
we look at the industry you're trying to
 
00:40:54.149 --> 00:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
create in new hampshire
 
00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
not all of your participants your
 
00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
farmers are going to want to grow for
 
00:41:00.229 --> 00:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
extracts and oil so you would be
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
restricting your market to local
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
producers when people are already um
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
using products from across the country
 
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
and um as
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
as it's been said you can't put
 
00:41:14.229 --> 00:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
toothpaste back in the tube um it's
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
already a national um commodity that's
 
00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's sold um usually the language that
 
00:41:23.189 --> 00:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
states will uh select for this type of
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh restriction or intent is to say any
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
state that participates in our state has
 
00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.830 align:start position:0%
state that participates in our state has
to

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:41:33.669 --> 00:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
a either have a usda approved plan
 
00:41:36.149 --> 00:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
or they need to have rules labeling
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
rules similar to our labeling rules but
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
other states are not restricting where
 
00:41:44.629 --> 00:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
participation has to come from only
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
in-state producers
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
um really great feedback with regards to
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
the dosing issue um and as it's been
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
stated the fda has not given given
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
guidance on upper control limits and
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
lower control limits um however um there
 
00:42:02.629 --> 00:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
is a study that's um being done under
 
00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
the guidance of the fda it's a valid
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
care study there are 12 industry
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
participants um that are doing this real
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
world evidence study and that will that
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
is a liver safety study
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
it is also looking at sleep and it's
 
00:42:20.229 --> 00:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
also looking at reproduction with
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
regards to
 
00:42:24.629 --> 00:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
testicular impacts that study the output
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
should be produced this quarter and the
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
fda will take the information from that
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
and their indication is that they will
 
00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
use that to have a little bit more
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
insight for the industry with regards to
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
dosing as well as
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
some of the liver concerns that have
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
been raised today
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
another point is when with the
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
disclaimers uh and the warnings i think
 
00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's really important that we warn um
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
with regards to the items listed um i
 
00:42:54.709 --> 00:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
would just caution against using
 
00:42:57.189 --> 00:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
specific specific language and requiring
 
00:42:59.350 --> 00:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
specific language because again
 
00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
multi-state operators are getting
 
00:43:03.669 --> 00:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
different language from different states
 
00:43:05.669 --> 00:43:05.679 align:start position:0%
and it's an undue burden for them to
 
00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
have to do separate labels first for all
 
00:43:11.669 --> 00:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
50 states in in the union so i would say
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
if the intent is to say um uh have a
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
warning about the use by pregnant and
 
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
lactating women use that type of
 
00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
language instead of the specific
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
language um that would have to that may
 
00:43:26.149 --> 00:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
not mirror what's happening in other
 
00:43:29.189 --> 00:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
states and would restrict commerce
 
00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
um great question that was raised with
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
regards to the topicals
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
and with regards to the um there's uh
 
00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
item number or provision number eight
 
00:43:42.149 --> 00:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
where it talks about manufacture date my
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that use expiration date
 
00:43:46.709 --> 00:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
especially if you're um trying to
 
00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
consider consumer protection um the
 
00:43:51.669 --> 00:43:51.679 align:start position:0%
manufacturer date won't mean as much to
 
00:43:54.629 --> 00:43:54.639 align:start position:0%
a consumer as an expiration date would
 
00:43:54.639 --> 00:43:55.830 align:start position:0%
a consumer as an expiration date would
so

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
great job thank you representative nerd
 
00:44:00.229 --> 00:44:00.239 align:start position:0%

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%

review and and great questions as far as
 
00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
how to move this industry forward in a
 
00:44:13.189 --> 00:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
way that is safe and consumer and uh
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony do we have
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
do not see any so uh
 
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
oh do we have one
 
00:44:34.709 --> 00:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
yep all right represented bixby yes i

taking my question uh mr chair and uh
uh

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
and mr powell um so
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
in regards to the uh
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
the interstate commerce uh with food
 
00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.790 align:start position:0%
the interstate commerce uh with food
products

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.910 align:start position:0%
products
um

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:52.870 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh the author of the bill has put in as
 
00:44:56.629 --> 00:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
the final sentence
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
if federal law allows interstate
 
00:45:00.709 --> 00:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
commerce of food products containing cbd
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
then this paragraph shall be void does
 
00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
that cover your concerns
 
00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think um
 
00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
with the with it being it because
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
basically it's being will be implemented
 
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
as a void provision so instead of
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
inserting in my preferred approach would
 
00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
be not to include it so it doesn't cause
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement confusion because in the
 
00:45:24.629 --> 00:45:24.639 align:start position:0%
states where we've had
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
voidable language we've seen where law
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement has to therefore put on
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
their judge hat their their lawyer hat
 
00:45:34.149 --> 00:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
and do the interpretation in munich at
 
00:45:36.229 --> 00:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
the municipality level or even at the
 
00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
individual officer level and that's
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
where we see people you know maybe
 
00:45:42.629 --> 00:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
getting arrested on and then having to
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
have the charges drops having to
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
hire lawyers when the salesperson the
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
retailer the manufacturer they're right
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
but it's a basically a layman's
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
interpretation of law so i am not really
 
00:45:57.350 --> 00:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
a fan of avoidable provision like that
 
00:45:59.669 --> 00:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
based on having reviewed the legislation
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
but at this point considering um again
 
00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
the usda interim final rules that were
 
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
just released
 
00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
and also the h.r 8179
 
00:46:14.229 --> 00:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
federal bill which has 30 sponsors and
 
00:46:16.149 --> 00:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
growing i think this is something that
 
00:46:18.229 --> 00:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
we should look to the federal government
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
to give us more direction on rather than
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
include it here and and be
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
an anomaly amongst the other
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
sister states
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
you're very welcome thank you for the
 
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
question do we have any further
 
00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:35.030 align:start position:0%
question do we have any further
questions

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you for your
 
00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you so much take care
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay next we'll have
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you members
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee for allowing me to
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
provide information today for the record
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
my name is colleen smith i'm the
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
administrator of the food protection
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
section within the department of health
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
while the department is not currently
 
00:47:05.669 --> 00:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
taking a position on the bill at the
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
time we'd like to highlight some areas
 
00:47:09.669 --> 00:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
for your consideration and also ask for
 
00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to provide some
 
00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
additional details with a fiscal note
 
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.229 align:start position:0%
additional details with a fiscal note
as

00:47:16.229 --> 00:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:47:18.229 --> 00:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
was previously stated
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
currently the u.s food and drug
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
administration does not allow cbd in
 
00:47:26.149 --> 00:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
food products and
 
00:47:28.229 --> 00:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
whereby new hampshire has adopted the
 
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
federal food code within its its food
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
safety regulations cbd derived from hemp
 
00:47:36.629 --> 00:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
or or any other source is not currently
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to be added to food so certainly
 
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
the sale of products containing cbd
 
00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
derived from hemp poses a regulatory
 
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
the well the food code states that
 
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.270 align:start position:0%
the well the food code states that
um

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
any food additive has to be approved and
 
00:47:56.149 --> 00:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
and because safety of cbd and food has
 
00:47:58.070 --> 00:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
not been adequately studied or it
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
currently is not allowed by fda and food
 
00:48:04.229 --> 00:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
section 2 lines 11 through 14 address
 
00:48:06.189 --> 00:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
this issue by stating that the
 
00:48:08.229 --> 00:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
non-pharmaceutical or non-medical
 
00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
production marketing sale or
 
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
distribution of food food additives or
 
00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
food products that contain hemp or cd
 
00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
cbd shall not
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
be prohibited within new hampshire
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
solely based on the inclusion of hemp or
 
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.070 align:start position:0%
solely based on the inclusion of hemp or
cbd

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
cbd
 
00:48:22.229 --> 00:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
and then section 3 further requires that
 
00:48:24.629 --> 00:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
the addition of cbd to any food product
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
shall take place in new hampshire
 
00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
this bill requires the department to
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
regulate would require the department to
 
00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
regulate all cbd infused products in the
 
00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
state and would require the department
 
00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
to inspect and enforce not only in the
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
the food retail environments but also in
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
establishments that traditionally food
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
inspectors don't
 
00:48:48.149 --> 00:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
routinely visit such as pet stores vape
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
shops cbd stores hair salons and spas
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
and wellness centers and
 
00:48:55.189 --> 00:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
and doctors offices
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
so if we this would this
 
00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
in essence wouldn't create a completely
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
um we would envision that this program
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for the creation
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
and maintain main maintain maintenance
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
of a registration database for all the
 
00:49:16.709 --> 00:49:16.719 align:start position:0%
cbd products
 
00:49:18.709 --> 00:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
inspections would be needed to be
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
conducted relative to registration of
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
products containing cbd
 
00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
and then also
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
there would need to be enforcement
 
00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
activities related to the sale of cbd
 
00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
products that did not have a valid
 
00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.510 align:start position:0%
products that did not have a valid
registration

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:49:33.189 --> 00:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
and then also
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
there is allowance for the propagation
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
of rules and consultation with the
 
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture markets and
 
00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.870 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture markets and
food

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
food
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
we have done some rough estimate
 
00:49:45.669 --> 00:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
estimates in
 
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
personnel cost in annual personnel costs
 
00:49:51.189 --> 00:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
um also including purchase of vehicles
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
for inspectors computers workstations
 
00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
and in a database
 
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.709 align:start position:0%
and in a database
so

00:49:56.709 --> 00:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:58.629 --> 00:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
at a minimum we're estimating it might
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
be 360 000
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
a year to stand up this program
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
it was previously noted there is a
 
00:50:07.669 --> 00:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
technical issue within the bill
 
00:50:10.149 --> 00:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
for the funding of the program while the
 
00:50:13.189 --> 00:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
department has fee granting authority to
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
charge a 100
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
registration fee annually there isn't
 
00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
an appropriation for startup costs
 
00:50:24.229 --> 00:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
the department also has concerns about
 
00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
the ability to approve a laboratory
 
00:50:30.149 --> 00:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
that is doing the
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
the analysis for the cbd products is
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
that something the department does not
 
00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:37.270 align:start position:0%
currently have
the

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
capacity to do
 
00:50:42.709 --> 00:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh and you know in lieu of fda action to
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
allow and regulate cbd as an approved
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
additive hb 272 proposes several
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
several suggestions to assure the safety
 
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
of cbd infused products for new
 
00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents to do this well and
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
to protect the residents of new
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire appropriate resources must be
 
00:51:00.149 --> 00:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
available to administer an effective
 
00:51:00.159 --> 00:51:01.109 align:start position:0%
available to administer an effective
program

00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
and further consideration must be given
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
to address the technical challenges
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
again i thank you for allowing me to
 
00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:08.560 align:start position:0%

thank you colleen are there any

thank you colleen are there any
questions

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
question and thank you to director smith
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question as well
 
00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
so are you indicating that most likely a
 
00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
third party lab would have to be
 
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
contracted to do the testing is that am
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
i understanding it correct
 
00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is written it does say
 
00:51:42.629 --> 00:51:42.639 align:start position:0%
that a third party laboratory would do
 
00:51:44.629 --> 00:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
the testing but the department would
 
00:51:47.189 --> 00:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
have to certify or approve that
 
00:51:47.199 --> 00:51:49.589 align:start position:0%
have to certify or approve that
laboratory

00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
laboratory
 
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
follow up if i may sorry
 
00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.030 align:start position:0%
follow up if i may sorry
and

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:57.189 --> 00:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
and are you saying that you currently
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
don't have a mechanism for doing that is
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
that can i hear a little bit more about
 
00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
that so the department currently doesn't
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
have a an approval process for approving
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you colleen would it be possible
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
for you to provide
 
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the committee with
 
00:52:21.189 --> 00:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
sort of the highlights of what you
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
provided us for information some of us
 
00:52:24.149 --> 00:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
were trying to write it down but i know
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
there was a lot there you think you
 
00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
could provide that for us in an email oh
 
00:52:30.229 --> 00:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
certainly we will provide a copy of the
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
testimony that would be great thank you
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%

the question so
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me so
 
00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
how many do we have any feel for how
 
00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
many products would are currently sold
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
that would be registered at a hundred
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh we we do not i um it we don't have a
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism currently for tracking that
 
00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
information just for example i went on a
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
internet site for a
 
00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
internet site for a
cbd

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:12.070 align:start position:0%
cbd
 
00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:13.830 align:start position:0%
cbd
[Music]

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
store and they had over 60 products in
 
00:53:18.229 --> 00:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
just that store alone and that's just
 
00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
one size it doesn't account for if
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
they're offering the same type of
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
product in multiple sizes
 
00:53:28.229 --> 00:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh follow up for five minutes
 
00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:31.990 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
so

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
so if i have a if i have a product you
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
know uh virgo's magical cbd
 
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm marketing that in
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
1 8 16 32 64 128 fluid ounces so i have
 
00:53:45.599 --> 00:53:46.950 align:start position:0%
1 8 16 32 64 128 fluid ounces so i have
multiple

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
packaging sizes but the product
 
00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
in the package is the same do i have to
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
pay 100 to register each one of those
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
sizes or am i paying the 100
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
registration fee for the
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
the particular product that's contained
 
00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:04.149 align:start position:0%
the particular product that's contained
within

00:54:04.149 --> 00:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:04.159 --> 00:54:04.950 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
would say that we would need more
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
further clarification on that but i
 
00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
believe it was mentioned um in previous
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
testimony that would be
 
00:54:16.229 --> 00:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
analysis per batch so if those products
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
were made for multiple batches
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
they might have to provide that analysis
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
at least um
 
00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
with each individual batch
 
00:54:28.149 --> 00:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
that follow up
 
00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
00:54:33.189 --> 00:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
so but my
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
so i understand providing the analysis
 
00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
but there's a hundred dollar per product
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
registration fee in the bill
 
00:54:40.149 --> 00:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:54:42.149 --> 00:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
you know to stand up a three hundred
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar
 
00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
um a year program you need at least
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
three thousand
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
products just to break even at that
 
00:54:52.709 --> 00:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
at that level so
 
00:54:52.719 --> 00:54:53.910 align:start position:0%
at that level so
it

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
do we believe that there are currently
 
00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
3 000 or more
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
unique products for sale in new
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire that would register at a
 
00:55:06.149 --> 00:55:06.159 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars for a product that that
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
and and i think right now that's that's
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
indeterminable and and also we don't
 
00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
know if any with those registration
 
00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.470 align:start position:0%
know if any with those registration
project

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
process would that deter or
 
00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
or encourage
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.629 --> 00:55:28.639 align:start position:0%

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
and that i was wondering if um using
 
00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
reference to that would be an
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
take care of the certifying labs who
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
accredited by the state and
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:57:40.149 --> 00:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
whether it make more sense to have that
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh in rulemaking or whether to have that
 
00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.189 --> 00:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question i i think
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
that would be um maybe a path forward
 
00:57:54.149 --> 00:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
into addressing that issue but certainly
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
we would probably want to involve
 
00:57:58.790 --> 00:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
some of our public health lab staff and
 
00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.310 align:start position:0%
some of our public health lab staff and
also

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
consult with the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.270 align:start position:0%
consult with the therapeutic cannabis
program

00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:58:05.669 --> 00:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
on their laboratory accreditation
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
procedures on on how maybe we could um
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
fix um add additional language to to
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
address that
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
so so internally so you would prefer to
 
00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
have that in the uh follow
 
00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
um so you'd prefer to have that in the
 
00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:23.430 align:start position:0%
um so you'd prefer to have that in the
um

00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
statute rather than in rulemaking
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
unless it was addressed
 
00:58:31.669 --> 00:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
in the the statute that gave the
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
department authority within rulemaking
 
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:34.870 align:start position:0%
department authority within rulemaking
to

00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
establish those laboratory standards
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you colleen for coming in and

you gave in the beginning very helpful
 
00:58:58.310 --> 00:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
yes we'll provide that thank you

a little bit of background on cbd in our

position um
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
the fda provided it interested persons
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
with the opportunity to submit comments
 
00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
about the who's recommendations to

impose international manufacturing and

distribution restrictions
 
00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
these comments were
 
01:00:00.629 --> 01:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
were considered in preparing the united
 
01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:01.910 align:start position:0%
were considered in preparing the united

position on these proposals for a

meeting uh at the u.n
 
01:00:10.629 --> 01:00:10.639 align:start position:0%
regarding cbd preparations the who and
 
01:00:12.629 --> 01:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
its expert committee prepared a health
 
01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
hazard evaluation
 
01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.910 align:start position:0%
hazard evaluation
and

01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
cbd while founding cannabis and cannabis
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
resin is not found to have the same
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
psychoactive properties and results in
 
01:00:26.229 --> 01:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
no potential use for abuse and protect
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
potential to produce dependency
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
now what we've seen
 
01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
at the federal level
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
and this is one of the reasons why we
 
01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.149 align:start position:0%
and this is one of the reasons why we
support

01:00:36.149 --> 01:00:36.159 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
is that across the country the states
 
01:00:42.229 --> 01:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
are recognizing the gap that's been left
 
01:00:44.149 --> 01:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
by the fda
 
01:00:46.229 --> 01:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
and are developing their own regulatory
 
01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
standards currently right now there are
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
about 21 states throughout the country
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
that have introduced or passed similar
 
01:00:54.629 --> 01:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
legislation to what's being considered
 
01:00:54.639 --> 01:00:55.589 align:start position:0%
legislation to what's being considered
today

01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:00:58.709 --> 01:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
and while uh mpa's opinion is that we'd
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
like to see the fda establish
 
01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
one uniform national standard we
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
legislators like yourselves need to take
 
01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this public health
 
01:01:12.709 --> 01:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
issue and establish a regulatory
 
01:01:15.189 --> 01:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
framework for manufacturers
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
um and that would include establishing a
 
01:01:20.229 --> 01:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
safe daily level of consumption
 
01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
inspecting facilities testing products
 
01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.350 align:start position:0%
inspecting facilities testing products
for

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
uh impurities such as lead and
 
01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
pesticides as well as thc
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
um over the last several years over 3
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
000 products have come to the market
 
01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
without a consistent approach um by the
 
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.990 align:start position:0%
without a consistent approach um by the
fda

01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
fda
 
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.030 align:start position:0%
fda
and

01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
about a year and a half ago we
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
commissioned a poll
 
01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
that found
 
01:01:46.550 --> 01:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
a large number of americans currently
 
01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
believe that the fda
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
is overdue in establishing safety
 
01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
standards and unfortunately 41 of those
 
01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
surveyed assume that the fda has already
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
taken that responsibility and
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
established safety standards
 
01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.270 align:start position:0%
established safety standards
um

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
and as i've mentioned before
 
01:02:08.709 --> 01:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
because the fda has not determined that
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
cbd is generally recognized that's as
 
01:02:11.119 --> 01:02:12.070 align:start position:0%
cbd is generally recognized that's as
safe

01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
safe
 
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
um we support uh elements to the bill
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
that i have you know um
 
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:19.910 align:start position:0%
that i have you know um
would

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
call for testing products for heavy
 
01:02:24.709 --> 01:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
metals pesticides and thc
 
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
um currently the usda
 
01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
has about 37
 
01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
testing laboratories throughout the
 
01:02:31.119 --> 01:02:32.390 align:start position:0%
testing laboratories throughout the
country

01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately
 
01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
the volume of hemp produced
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
and the lack of facilities has led to an
 
01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
industry-wide concern
 
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.709 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
this is part of the reason why we've
 
01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
advocated at the federal level for
 
01:02:48.229 --> 01:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
providing an independent verification
 
01:02:48.239 --> 01:02:49.189 align:start position:0%
providing an independent verification
program

01:02:49.189 --> 01:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
for product analysis
 
01:02:54.149 --> 01:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
we would work with the university of
 
01:02:56.149 --> 01:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
mississippi to randomly select a
 
01:02:58.310 --> 01:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
thousand products that purport to
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
contain cbd and these products would be
 
01:03:03.189 --> 01:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
tested using known standards for their
 
01:03:05.189 --> 01:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
content impurities
 
01:03:05.199 --> 01:03:06.790 align:start position:0%
content impurities
um

01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:08.709 --> 01:03:08.719 align:start position:0%
you know pro when it comes to product
 
01:03:10.310 --> 01:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
labeling despite the fact that the
 
01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
market for cbd
 
01:03:17.189 --> 01:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
has grown significantly the fda and ftc
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
have done little enforcement actions on
 
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
these products
 
01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.390 align:start position:0%
these products
um

01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of their enforcement
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
actions have been uh what we would
 
01:03:30.229 --> 01:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
consider low-hanging fruit which
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
comes from unsupported health claims and
 
01:03:34.790 --> 01:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:03:38.149 --> 01:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
another reason as to why we support the
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
labeling elements to this bill
 
01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
if you were to look at what's being done
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
internationally in the united united
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
kingdom um
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
they've established a series of
 
01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
requirements including a recommended
 
01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
daily dose ensuring that amounts
 
01:03:58.070 --> 01:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
consume do not exceed 70 milligrams for
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
a healthy adult
 
01:04:02.149 --> 01:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
and they also have included
 
01:04:05.669 --> 01:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh product labeling requirements
 
01:04:05.679 --> 01:04:06.870 align:start position:0%
uh product labeling requirements
for

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
minors as well as
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
and you know that's kind of
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
where mpa's position is on this we
 
01:04:20.149 --> 01:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
strongly urge you guys to support this
 
01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and move it forward
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
because as the leading trade association
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
for natural products and dietary
 
01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
supplements what we've seen is a
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
marketplace that
 
01:04:35.189 --> 01:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
has allowed for
 
01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous actors to enter the
 
01:04:43.189 --> 01:04:43.199 align:start position:0%

you on hb 318 for the official status of

the daring jumping spider as the state's
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
the state spider of new hampshire
 
01:18:03.190 --> 01:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
this bill was introduced on behalf of my
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
constituents in the hollis primary
 
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:08.950 align:start position:0%
constituents in the hollis primary
school

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:18:12.549 --> 01:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
and the bill was first brought to me by
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
environmental science teacher mrs happy
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
who is going to speak after me
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
and before the expert witnesses from
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
team spider that you'll be hearing today
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
as i reviewed rsa3 on state symbols and
 
01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
emblems i realized that the purple lilac
 
01:18:32.309 --> 01:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
and the white potato may not be
 
01:18:35.589 --> 01:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
everyone's favorite flower or vegetable
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
but someone at some point found the
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
significance of these symbols to be
 
01:18:42.549 --> 01:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
applicable and important and significant
 
01:18:44.309 --> 01:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and so they brought
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
them to the legislature for
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
consideration of symbolic to the state
 
01:18:52.389 --> 01:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of giving them official status
 
01:18:55.190 --> 01:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
as i learned more about the process that
 
01:18:57.349 --> 01:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
these third graders
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
the witnesses you will be hearing from
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
today are eight years old
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
the process that they underwent to
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
determine which spider would be the
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate spider to be a state spider
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:19:10.629 --> 01:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
i think they have done their due
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
diligence that would make some of us
 
01:19:15.429 --> 01:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
feel bad that we don't do our homework
 
01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
as well as they do they're quite
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
impressive so
 
01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.709 align:start position:0%
impressive so
um

01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
so i think you know they
 
01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:24.830 align:start position:0%
have have their arguments together
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:25.990 align:start position:0%
have have their arguments together

01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
i think mrs happy and team spider
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
the team spider folks that are here that
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%

we're just using a different zoom
 
01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
platform that i'm used to teaching my
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
students with but let's start over
 
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
all right so my name is tara happy and
 
01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman pearl and members of
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
the environment and agriculture
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing us today
 
01:21:21.349 --> 01:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
i'm the environmental science teacher
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
here at hollis primary school and i
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
teach year-round outdoor education to
 
01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through third graders here
 
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
in hollis and this year as a result of
 
01:21:31.349 --> 01:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
an online new hampshire fish and game
 
01:21:33.670 --> 01:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
workshop that i attended i created a
 
01:21:36.469 --> 01:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
week-long spider unit for third graders
 
01:21:38.469 --> 01:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
i had found that after i had began to
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
learn more about spiders and all the
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
amazing things they can do that i was
 
01:21:44.309 --> 01:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
sincerely less afraid of them i'm not a
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
fan of spiders
 
01:21:48.710 --> 01:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
but as i went through this program i i
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
began to appreciate them and so knowing
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
that spiders are a common fear of
 
01:21:54.389 --> 01:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
children i hope that with some positive
 
01:21:56.150 --> 01:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
education on the topic i could do the
 
01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
same for my students and eliminate a
 
01:22:00.230 --> 01:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
learned fear that so many of us have
 
01:22:02.230 --> 01:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
and so this started off just as an
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
honest effort to make children more
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable with spiders but what i
 
01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:06.630 align:start position:0%
comfortable with spiders but what i
didn't

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:22:08.469 --> 01:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
happen was a school-wide movement to
 
01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
elect a new hampshire state spider
 
01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
after learning how important spiders are
 
01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
to our world the students were a little
 
01:22:16.230 --> 01:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
shocked to learn that such an important
 
01:22:18.230 --> 01:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
species wasn't recognized with a state
 
01:22:20.309 --> 01:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
symbol and the kids instantly declared
 
01:22:22.150 --> 01:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't fair and spiders deserve
 
01:22:24.630 --> 01:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
to be loved just as anyone else
 
01:22:27.349 --> 01:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
so the kids told me that small and scary
 
01:22:29.349 --> 01:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
things are still special to our world
 
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
and it was like watching a crowd unravel
 
01:22:33.190 --> 01:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
as they began to cheer on the underdog
 
01:22:35.190 --> 01:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
of a losing football game i really had
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
to admire the determination to help out
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
this spider in general so off we went
 
01:22:40.150 --> 01:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
with the idea
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
we researched some spiders we checked
 
01:22:44.309 --> 01:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
with two game in a local nature center
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we had all of the most
 
01:22:47.670 --> 01:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
important species represented in our
 
01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
election and then our election began we
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
had the web spinning spiders versus the
 
01:22:54.389 --> 01:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
hunter spiders
 
01:22:56.230 --> 01:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
and there were spider speeches from our
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
four candidates some very heated spider
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
debates placed in our formal forest
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
classroom but in the end a hunting
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
spider the daring jumping spider won
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
some students were happy and some were
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
sad but we all agreed to back up our
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
winning spider candidate
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
we felt that this spider represented the
 
01:23:15.349 --> 01:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
spirit of new hampshire
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
be brave and take bumps but hey leave a
 
01:23:19.429 --> 01:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
web as you fly through the air just in
 
01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
case be tough and survive these long
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
hard winters so you can eventually enjoy
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
the warmer weather and be adventurous
 
01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
hunt and explore and don't just sit in
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
one place and wait for food to come to
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
you go get it
 
01:23:32.469 --> 01:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
so all i know is that i started off with
 
01:23:34.389 --> 01:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
the class yelling ew
 
01:23:36.150 --> 01:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
and by the end of the week i had lined
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
them up in our garden and they were
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
literally waiting in line to hold a
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
little black spider with their bare
 
01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:42.070 align:start position:0%
little black spider with their bare
hands

01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
hands
 
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
so it's really all about how something
 
01:23:46.469 --> 01:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
is presented and today our students are
 
01:23:48.230 --> 01:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
going to explain how and why they love
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
this little daring jump rider thank you
 
01:23:52.469 --> 01:23:52.479 align:start position:0%

committee hi my name is chloe and we are
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
here from hollis primary school and we
 
01:25:15.349 --> 01:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
are here to prove our point on why we
 
01:25:17.349 --> 01:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
think the daring jumping spider should
 
01:25:19.670 --> 01:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
be new hampshire state spider
 
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
our environmental science teacher mrs
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
happy discovered that new hampshire does
 
01:25:27.190 --> 01:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
not have a state spider yet
 
01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.150 align:start position:0%
not have a state spider yet
and

01:25:28.150 --> 01:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:30.550 align:start position:0%
and
we

01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
and we all think we should mrs happy
 
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
talk to some state representatives and
 
01:25:36.389 --> 01:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
they thought it would be a good idea too
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of time learning about
 
01:25:40.150 --> 01:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
spiders and we even went outside in the
 
01:25:42.389 --> 01:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
woods and gardens to look for spiders we
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
hunted for spiders spider webs and any
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
traces of spiders we could find
 
01:25:49.349 --> 01:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
we found three in my class and i held
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
one on a stick and now eva will tell you
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%

hampshire state spider
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%

01:27:47.349 --> 01:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
of time this school year learning about
 
01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
spiders even finding some in our school
 
01:27:52.230 --> 01:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
gardens my friends got to hold them
 
01:27:54.389 --> 01:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
mrs happy taught us
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
about how spiders are such an important
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
part of the wildlife in new hampshire
 
01:28:01.190 --> 01:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire like most other states
 
01:28:04.469 --> 01:28:04.479 align:start position:0%
mislists many insects among their state

01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
these include honeybees butterflies
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
dragonflies and ladybugs however south
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
carolina is the only state to recognize
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
a spider as a state symbol it's the

carolina wolf spider
 
01:28:19.190 --> 01:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
in addition to a state insect
 
01:28:21.349 --> 01:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
interestingly this was the results of
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
the efforts of a third grader now new
 
01:28:25.349 --> 01:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire third graders like me want to
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
continue to build awareness of how
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
valuable spiders are and select one type
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
that is a good fit for state
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of people i know don't like
 
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.230 align:start position:0%
a lot of people i know don't like
spiders

01:28:36.230 --> 01:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
spiders
 
01:28:38.710 --> 01:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
some people think they're scary ugly and
 
01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:39.830 align:start position:0%
some people think they're scary ugly and
annoying

01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
annoying
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
this year i learned that spiders are
 
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
really helpful to our environment this
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
is because they eat mosquitoes flies and
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
bugs and other insects we might
 
01:28:50.309 --> 01:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
encounter when we spend time outside
 
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
they help keep those population balanced
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
which is for our gardens in the inside
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
of our homes if we didn't have spiders
 
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
it would just
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
change and the number of household cats
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
could skyrocket we wouldn't want that
 
01:29:04.469 --> 01:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
would we if new hampshire is nine state
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
spiders an official beverage the state
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
dog estate insects and nine state songs
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
and spiders should not be left out even
 
01:29:13.190 --> 01:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
though spiders might be small and look
 
01:29:15.190 --> 01:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
different from other creatures they are
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
really mighty and each one has its own
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
special talents and characteristics
 
01:29:22.309 --> 01:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire a great choice is the
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
jumping spider they're generally
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
friendly enjoy spending time in the
 
01:29:27.670 --> 01:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
garden and they have the super power
 
01:29:30.230 --> 01:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
they can jump 20 to 50 times their own
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
body size of all the spiders in new
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire the jumping spiders leaps and
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
bounds above the rest jeffrey can tell
 
01:29:50.150 --> 01:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to thank chairman pearl and the
 
01:29:55.429 --> 01:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
environmental committee for letting us
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
to be here today to speak on behalf of
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
our school
 
01:30:00.630 --> 01:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
i think we should have the daring
 
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
jumping spider as our state spider
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
because of the following reasons
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
one he's cute and colorful
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
like new hampshire's trees in autumn
 
01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.110 align:start position:0%
like new hampshire's trees in autumn
two

01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:30:15.190 --> 01:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
daring jumping spiders create parachutes
 
01:30:17.429 --> 01:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
when they are young so they can fly away
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
to a new home
 
01:30:20.309 --> 01:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
they like to be free just like the
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire believe in
 
01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:23.429 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire believe in
freedom

01:30:23.429 --> 01:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
01:30:23.439 --> 01:30:24.389 align:start position:0%
freedom
three

01:30:24.389 --> 01:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
daring dumpling spiders are very
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
resilient to the cold
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
they survive new hampshire's winter just
 
01:30:33.429 --> 01:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
like we survive our cold climates
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
four we can also make some money to
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
benefit from new hampshire there could
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
be state spider key chains refrigerator
 
01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.590 align:start position:0%
be state spider key chains refrigerator
magnets

01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
magnets
 
01:30:44.469 --> 01:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
t-shirts and maybe even put our hearing
 
01:30:47.349 --> 01:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
jumping spider on our on our new
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire license plate
 
01:30:51.670 --> 01:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
we have a state vegetable and i don't
 
01:30:53.190 --> 01:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
really like vegetables so i think we
 
01:30:54.630 --> 01:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
should have a steak spider to even it
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
out a bit
 
01:30:58.710 --> 01:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking our daring jumping
 
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
spider into consideration thank you for
 
01:31:04.230 --> 01:31:04.240 align:start position:0%

they have presented their findings uh
 
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
our pre-k to third grade students voted
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
on this and um everybody had a voice in
 
01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:31.990 align:start position:0%
on this and um everybody had a voice in
it

01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:32:34.389 --> 01:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
when we actually got to the final daring
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
jumping spider and when i announced it
 
01:32:38.309 --> 01:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
over the speaker i could hear the cheers
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
in the building that they were excited
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
that daring jumping spider won
 
01:32:44.469 --> 01:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
as you all know our school year just
 
01:32:46.469 --> 01:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
hasn't been the same although we are in
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
person learning our third graders have
 
01:32:50.150 --> 01:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
had to look for other options for
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
excitement um
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
activities such as this
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
we have focused on kindness and
 
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
compassion through our choose love
 
01:33:00.150 --> 01:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
lessons and how we support and love
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
everyone regardless
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
our students are supporting a small and
 
01:33:05.349 --> 01:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
somewhat scary
 
01:33:07.349 --> 01:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
creature and it's a really big deal
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
because it shows just that
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
and they understand that all living
 
01:33:13.190 --> 01:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
things have a purpose
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
i urge you to show these students that
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
their hard work their lessons learned
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
their compassion and understanding
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
and their reflection and their ability
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
to change
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't go unnoticed i hope that you can
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
support them thank you so much for
 
01:33:28.469 --> 01:33:28.479 align:start position:0%

they are super excited and i can't wait
 
01:33:31.670 --> 01:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
to share
 
01:33:33.190 --> 01:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
with our community and everybody with
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%

well thank you all that was quite a
 
01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:49.510 align:start position:0%
well thank you all that was quite a
presentation

01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
i learned a few things about the jumping
 
01:33:53.349 --> 01:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
spider that i did not know as i expect
 
01:33:55.190 --> 01:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
we all did
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
so um i'll open it up i guess at this
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
point to see if there's any questions of
 
01:34:02.309 --> 01:34:02.319 align:start position:0%
the kids and uh if you can
 
01:34:03.429 --> 01:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
pitch the questions and i guess if
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
you've got want to bring with the kids
 
01:34:06.309 --> 01:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
on and answer them yourself i'll leave
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
that up to you so uh representative
 
01:34:10.469 --> 01:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
aaron i'll recognize you for a question
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much and um
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
i absolutely
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
i'm so excited for the work that these
 
01:34:20.630 --> 01:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
kids put forth obviously
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
in this presentation
 
01:34:24.710 --> 01:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
i'm interested to know from each of the
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
children that spoke
 
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
what is their favorite
 
01:34:32.710 --> 01:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
fact about this particular spider just
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.110 --> 01:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:47.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
so my favorite fact about the during
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
jumping spider is that its dumping
 
01:34:54.630 --> 01:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
spider doesn't actually
 
01:35:03.429 --> 01:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
my favorite fact about the daring
 
01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
jumping spider is that in the winter it
 
01:35:09.349 --> 01:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't just curl up and die it stays
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
my favorite fact about the daring
 
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
jumping spider is that he can jump very
 
01:35:24.630 --> 01:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:26.309 --> 01:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
my favorite fact about the jarring
 
01:35:28.469 --> 01:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
jumping spider is that it can make a
 
01:35:28.479 --> 01:35:30.070 align:start position:0%
jumping spider is that it can make a
parachute

01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
parachute
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
those are all awesome
 
01:35:39.670 --> 01:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so much that was wonderful all
 
01:35:42.469 --> 01:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
right i will recognize uh rep perez for
 
01:35:45.429 --> 01:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
actually it's not a question but i want
 
01:35:48.710 --> 01:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:51.120 align:start position:0%

learned about the spider
um

01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:02.309 --> 01:36:02.319 align:start position:0%

01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
when i started learning about this
 
01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:08.160 align:start position:0%

and then
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%

information
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
especially the pictures of the spider
 
01:36:47.190 --> 01:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
with the pdf attachments to the news to
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%

class of hollis primary i wanted to ask
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
mrs happy
 
01:37:17.429 --> 01:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
if this was a project that was done by
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
the entire third grade i'm sorry i
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear it very clearly at the
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
beginning or just a one class of that
 
01:37:26.230 --> 01:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
and then i also wanted to comment and
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
say that i
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
learned a lot i really appreciate all
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
the work that you did nora your mom was
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
telling me about how hard your whole
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
class worked in this and i just want to
 
01:37:37.190 --> 01:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
say congratulations i'm just so glad
 
01:37:40.630 --> 01:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
you're here today but thank you
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um so this started
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
off as a project that was intended to be
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
just for the third graders um knowing
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
that spiders are a little scary and
 
01:37:51.429 --> 01:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
sketchy i didn't want to um
 
01:37:53.429 --> 01:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
traumatize any young kindergartners or
 
01:37:54.630 --> 01:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
anything like that so i thought i'd
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
break everybody in easy and just go with
 
01:37:59.110 --> 01:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
third grade um but then as it kind of
 
01:38:02.389 --> 01:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
expanded be a state spider event we
 
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that this was
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
something that our entire school got to
 
01:38:07.110 --> 01:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
01:38:10.309 --> 01:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
um we kind of took it as like we were
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
one big united states of our school and
 
01:38:15.110 --> 01:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
every class got to have their own winner
 
01:38:17.349 --> 01:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
and get all up together and we had to
 
01:38:19.670 --> 01:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
count the votes so and it kind of
 
01:38:21.349 --> 01:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
happened all along the same time so it
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
mirrored the election but was actually
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
it was great to have that kind of aspect
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
thrown into it as well so while we have
 
01:38:31.670 --> 01:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
students from two different third grade
 
01:38:33.110 --> 01:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
classes here
 
01:38:36.230 --> 01:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
it did indeed go across the entire third
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
graders even our remote class at home
 
01:38:41.349 --> 01:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
they had a lot of input as well and i
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
gave them a lot of at-home spiders
 
01:38:45.190 --> 01:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
probably a lot of fighters living in
 
01:38:46.710 --> 01:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
your basement addicts we found a lot
 
01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:47.510 align:start position:0%
your basement addicts we found a lot
there

01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
so i i do have a question
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
the uh as you're well aware we're in
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
sort of covert protocols and everything
 
01:39:02.309 --> 01:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
we do you are a school we are here at
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
the state house so one of the
 
01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
experiences that
 
01:39:08.150 --> 01:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
these types of bills that the school
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
classes usually bring is
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
they get to see it go through the
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
committee and they get to
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know tune in on the executive
 
01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
session when we move the bill forward to
 
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
the house floor and
 
01:39:18.309 --> 01:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
then they'll uh when it's on the house
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
floor they'll typically come and sit in
 
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
the gallery and get to you know be
 
01:39:24.150 --> 01:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
recognized by the speaker and you know
 
01:39:26.230 --> 01:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes we'll put an argument for and
 
01:39:28.230 --> 01:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
against you know on on the bill just so
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
they can see the whole experience
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
obviously under our coveted protocols
 
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to do that
 
01:39:34.150 --> 01:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
because we're not allowed to have any
 
01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
guests into the into the house sessions
 
01:39:39.110 --> 01:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
my question to you
 
01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:40.469 align:start position:0%
my question to you
is

01:39:40.469 --> 01:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:39:42.150 --> 01:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
we have an option as a committee to
 
01:39:44.630 --> 01:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
retain a bill and hold it and
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
we could recommend it for passage later
 
01:39:48.469 --> 01:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
in the year and it would come to the
 
01:39:51.110 --> 01:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
house floor in january by then it's my
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
hope as i think it is with all of us
 
01:39:54.309 --> 01:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
that we'll be back into our normal house
 
01:39:56.150 --> 01:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
sessions in the
 
01:39:58.309 --> 01:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh representatives hall and the children
 
01:39:59.670 --> 01:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
would be able to attend and be in the
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
gallery now i recognize that that may
 
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
cause a problem because they may be in
 
01:40:05.670 --> 01:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
another year of school and so i guess my
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's my question to you is if we were
 
01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
to do that in the children i guess then
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
would be fourth graders would would they
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
still be involved and still be able to
 
01:40:16.230 --> 01:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
come and enjoy the full process
 
01:40:17.670 --> 01:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
you know of being in reps hall and
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
seeing the bill come to the floor
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
oh i feel like if this um that these
 
01:40:25.429 --> 01:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
third graders they're pretty um set on
 
01:40:27.110 --> 01:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
following this through even if it was
 
01:40:29.110 --> 01:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
something that was turned down we're
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
just gonna try again as fourth graders
 
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
these guys are really really
 
01:40:35.910 --> 01:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
bent on having a state spider so i feel
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
like and i'll follow them too our school
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
ends at third grade but this is
 
01:40:41.349 --> 01:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
something that i will definitely help
 
01:40:43.670 --> 01:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
them continue to work towards
 
01:40:45.110 --> 01:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
well we certainly don't have to do that
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's an option my thought was getting
 
01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
them the full experience of because
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
because really the true experience is
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
coming to reps hall it's it's
 
01:40:53.349 --> 01:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
you know we we're one of the oldest
 
01:40:55.190 --> 01:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
serving legislators in the same building
 
01:40:56.469 --> 01:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
and it's it's just a real great
 
01:40:58.469 --> 01:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
experience for all the children so that
 
01:41:00.630 --> 01:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
was just a thought i had and i'm sorry
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
to see what works well for you guys you
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
do we have any further questions we do
 
01:41:14.230 --> 01:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
we still have a couple hands out but
 
01:41:18.469 --> 01:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
representative verville has a question
 
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
yeah not so much a question is uh but a
 
01:41:22.630 --> 01:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
statement so um thank you for the
 
01:41:24.630 --> 01:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
presentation today you guys did a great
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
job you should be very proud of
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
yourselves and i just wanted to commend
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
you um i know i received emails from
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
many of you uh advocating in favor of
 
01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
your bill
 
01:41:36.389 --> 01:41:36.399 align:start position:0%
before the committee
 
01:41:39.670 --> 01:41:39.680 align:start position:0%

01:41:42.230 --> 01:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
thing to do and you guys were very smart

to lay the groundwork for your for your
 
01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:47.510 align:start position:0%
to lay the groundwork for your for your
bill

i have a little bit of connection i used
 
01:41:51.349 --> 01:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
to be a high school science teacher in
 
01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
hollis at hollis brookline high school
 
01:41:56.070 --> 01:41:56.080 align:start position:0%

01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
hi thank you um mr chair and thank you
 
01:42:20.469 --> 01:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
to the third grade class and to mrs
 
01:42:20.479 --> 01:42:21.349 align:start position:0%
to the third grade class and to mrs
happy

01:42:21.349 --> 01:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
happy
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know who to address the question
 
01:42:26.309 --> 01:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
to um but i did notice in your pdf slide
 
01:42:29.349 --> 01:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
that the spider has very bright colors
 
01:42:32.070 --> 01:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
at its face area and i was curious to
 
01:42:35.349 --> 01:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
know um if there was a scientific reason
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
for that and if any of you uncovered
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
that in your studies as to why they're
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:44.550 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
i know
 
01:42:48.309 --> 01:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
so and and you're in you're correct in
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
noticing that so i do have a picture
 
01:42:51.670 --> 01:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
right here they do have a kind of a blue
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
teal green iridescence you can kind of
 
01:42:56.309 --> 01:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
see on his on those are his fangs
 
01:42:58.230 --> 01:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of what sets this guy
 
01:43:00.389 --> 01:43:00.399 align:start position:0%
apart from other jumping spiders and
 
01:43:02.190 --> 01:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
that this is one of the key
 
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
identifications that you can do with
 
01:43:07.429 --> 01:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
them and it just makes them look really
 
01:43:10.710 --> 01:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
pretty to a girl spider so
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
kind of helps in that regard and they
 
01:43:14.469 --> 01:43:14.479 align:start position:0%
dance a lot too
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and to the third
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
graders great job presenting you guys

next wednesday afternoon i believe
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me once our final bill is done my
 
01:43:51.429 --> 01:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
estimate is it will be
 
01:43:53.190 --> 01:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
at least three o'clock and maybe towards
 
01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:54.070 align:start position:0%
at least three o'clock and maybe towards
four

01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:43:56.389 --> 01:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh if if you'd like to be in attendance
 
01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
we can certainly try and get one of us
 
01:43:59.269 --> 01:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
to reach out and connect with you as
 
01:44:00.710 --> 01:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
we're getting close to the end of our
 
01:44:02.389 --> 01:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
last hearing so you could sign on if
 
01:44:04.469 --> 01:44:04.479 align:start position:0%
that's possible
 
01:44:06.710 --> 01:44:06.720 align:start position:0%

from today i believe that's february 3rd
okay

01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:12.389 --> 01:44:12.399 align:start position:0%

01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
ahead okay um just after thinking more
 
01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:21.670 align:start position:0%
ahead okay um just after thinking more
about

01:44:21.670 --> 01:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:44:23.349 --> 01:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
about all the hard work that these guys
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
have put into this and i'm looking at
 
01:44:26.389 --> 01:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
their little faces behind their little
 
01:44:26.399 --> 01:44:27.910 align:start position:0%
their little faces behind their little
masks

01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
masks
 
01:44:30.150 --> 01:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
they they could really use a win this
 
01:44:32.389 --> 01:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
year they could really we we could l
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
we'd love to have a little spider party
 
01:44:36.469 --> 01:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
have a reason to celebrate it's been a
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
rough year their whole world's upside
 
01:44:40.389 --> 01:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
down they eat lunch in their classrooms
 
01:44:43.190 --> 01:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
and it's just been kind of
 
01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.469 align:start position:0%
and it's just been kind of
so

01:44:44.469 --> 01:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
as far as waiting i don't want to say
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
that i'm ungrateful for that opportunity
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
because i i would be and i'm i'm patient
 
01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
and i try to teach kids about being
 
01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:53.990 align:start position:0%
and i try to teach kids about being
patient

01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
patient
 
01:44:56.309 --> 01:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
but we could really use it when
 
01:44:59.349 --> 01:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
the kids need this so if that's any if
 
01:45:01.269 --> 01:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
that's any kind of
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
something to take into consideration i
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted to throw that out there real
 
01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:05.750 align:start position:0%
just wanted to throw that out there real
quick

01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
quick
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you very much
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no other hands are
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
raised i will close the hearing on house

bill 318
 
01:45:17.269 --> 01:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
and we will
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
take up our next bill in
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
three minutes which will be house bill
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the reminder i believe
 
01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:43.830 align:start position:0%
thank you for the reminder i believe
that

01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.469 --> 01:45:46.479 align:start position:0%
oh there was one everybody testified and
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%

01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
pit my elegance uh my eloquence
 
01:48:14.950 --> 01:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
against the
 
01:48:18.309 --> 01:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
third graders from hollis
 
01:48:20.389 --> 01:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i will be found wanting at the
 
01:48:23.429 --> 01:48:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:26.230 --> 01:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee
 
01:48:28.150 --> 01:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me introduce house
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
bill 95 for the record
 
01:48:32.710 --> 01:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
i'm representative jim allard
 
01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.070 align:start position:0%
i'm representative jim allard
representing

01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
representing
 
01:48:36.710 --> 01:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
merrimack district 21 the towns of
 
01:48:39.349 --> 01:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
pittsfield and epsom
 
01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
and for many of you on the committee
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
this bill may appear familiar
 
01:48:48.389 --> 01:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
and that is because you have seen it uh
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
once before
 
01:48:53.269 --> 01:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
house bill 95 is identical uh in its
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
form and intent
 
01:48:56.830 --> 01:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
to house bill
 
01:49:00.230 --> 01:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
1234 which passed unanimously by your
 
01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:01.670 align:start position:0%
1234 which passed unanimously by your
committee

01:49:01.670 --> 01:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
last session and subsequently passed on
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar in the house
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it was one more victim of
 
01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:13.349 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it was one more victim of
colbit

01:49:13.349 --> 01:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
colbit
 
01:49:14.389 --> 01:49:14.399 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:49:17.110 --> 01:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
we're having to take it up again
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
what house bill 95 seeks to do is open
 
01:49:24.469 --> 01:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
wider the doors of opportunity for
 
01:49:27.429 --> 01:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
farmers in new hampshire specifically by
 
01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
adding ice cream to the list of approved
 
01:49:34.230 --> 01:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
products that may be made with raw milk
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
it is a bipartisan bill and has been
 
01:49:38.150 --> 01:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
from its inception
 
01:49:40.389 --> 01:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
it is coordinated with stakeholders at
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
services very specifically the food
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
safety folks
 
01:49:48.710 --> 01:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
as well as the farm bureau and the
 
01:49:50.469 --> 01:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
personal involvement of the commissioner
 
01:49:52.630 --> 01:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
of agriculture
 
01:49:54.710 --> 01:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
i certainly hope that you can support
 
01:49:57.190 --> 01:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
this initiative and i am ready to take
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have for me
 
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative allard i'll
 
01:50:06.150 --> 01:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
make one note uh for many of the
 
01:50:07.670 --> 01:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee members there's one section of
 
01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
this bill that
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
we'll need to edit that got in from a
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
different copy of last year
 
01:50:16.230 --> 01:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
and that is the part that says we need
 
01:50:18.389 --> 01:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
to remove the part that says or any
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
other product containing raw milk
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
because that created some issues and uh
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll certainly draft an amendment
 
01:50:26.309 --> 01:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
as a committee and i've spoken with
 
01:50:26.319 --> 01:50:27.670 align:start position:0%
as a committee and i've spoken with
representative

01:50:27.670 --> 01:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
i'll allow him to confirm that he's uh
 
01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:30.870 align:start position:0%
i'll allow him to confirm that he's uh
also

01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:50:34.469 --> 01:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
in agreement with removing that language
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes indeed sir
 
01:50:38.230 --> 01:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
all right are there any questions for
 
01:50:43.349 --> 01:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:52.630 --> 01:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
i do not see any hands raised so
 
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:05.670 --> 01:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
okay he's not on the committee so all
 
01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:06.389 align:start position:0%

representative thank you and uh we will
 
01:51:11.429 --> 01:51:11.439 align:start position:0%

01:51:13.269 --> 01:51:13.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:51:17.110 --> 01:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
next i will call representative woodcock
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh hopefully you
 
01:51:21.349 --> 01:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
can hear me as well we can
 
01:51:23.110 --> 01:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
i was one of the co-sponsors with
 
01:51:25.349 --> 01:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative allen last year
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:30.710 --> 01:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
let me first tell you that i represent
 
01:51:33.190 --> 01:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
conway chatham and eaton
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
which all have multiple small family
 
01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:37.510 align:start position:0%
which all have multiple small family
farms

01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
farms
 
01:51:39.269 --> 01:51:39.279 align:start position:0%
and the goat
 
01:51:42.150 --> 01:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
ice cream issue became relevant to me
 
01:51:44.469 --> 01:51:44.479 align:start position:0%
as it did gym last year we both have
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
small family farms in our
 
01:51:49.110 --> 01:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
in our representative area that have an
 
01:51:52.230 --> 01:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
excess of goat milk and the opportunity
 
01:51:54.309 --> 01:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
to use that for revenue particularly
 
01:51:57.110 --> 01:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
these last couple of years is uh been
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
critical to them
 
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
so on my side of the state uh a couple
 
01:52:03.190 --> 01:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
came approached me at the same time as
 
01:52:06.469 --> 01:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative alex uh issue uh of the
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
an additional revenue resource for them
 
01:52:13.590 --> 01:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
during their slow summer months
 
01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:14.389 align:start position:0%
during their slow summer months
and

01:52:14.389 --> 01:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
find a reasonable
 
01:52:18.309 --> 01:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
way to get rid of the excess goat milk
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
that they have versus just dumping it
 
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
um and i mean they already use it for
 
01:52:24.710 --> 01:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
milk products they always use it for go
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
for salt products but those things but
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
this is a small niche area it's small
 
01:52:30.710 --> 01:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
farms it's off their land
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
and it would be a real revenue help as a
 
01:52:35.269 --> 01:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
bridge to get them through the summers
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
um so i'm here in support of the bill as
 
01:52:40.630 --> 01:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
i was last year in support of the the
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
especially two goat farms in the
 
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
my area that uh look forward to uh and
 
01:52:48.309 --> 01:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
honestly we're disappointed last year we
 
01:52:50.230 --> 01:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
got hit by that final uh
 
01:52:53.429 --> 01:52:53.439 align:start position:0%
bill uh problem at the end wanted wanted
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
to inadvertently go out and get excited
 
01:52:58.710 --> 01:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:00.469 --> 01:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
mechanical device to help with it so
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
they still are uh hoping this year that
 
01:53:05.670 --> 01:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
this revenue bridge can be approved by
 
01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
the york committee and as well as the
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
house and move forward so that they have
 
01:53:12.710 --> 01:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
a chance to continue with the small
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
family farms which are as you all know
 
01:53:17.110 --> 01:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
very difficult to maintain and
 
01:53:18.389 --> 01:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
turn a profit
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
i'll be happy to take any questions
 
01:53:20.710 --> 01:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:22.389 --> 01:53:22.399 align:start position:0%

questions for representative woodcart
[Music]

01:53:30.230 --> 01:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%

welcome
 
01:53:39.590 --> 01:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
next i will call on jill fudala
 
01:53:41.190 --> 01:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
she's representing herself she is
 
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
actually a little history for those who
 
01:53:45.190 --> 01:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
aren't here she is um
 
01:53:47.110 --> 01:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
was sort of the main reason this bill
 
01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
was was drafted was she was selling some
 
01:53:51.670 --> 01:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
ice cream and
 
01:53:53.190 --> 01:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:53:55.670 --> 01:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
she ran into a situation where the law
 
01:53:57.590 --> 01:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
didn't permit her to do it so
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative allen drafted the statute
 
01:54:02.710 --> 01:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
last year statute change and uh
 
01:54:05.190 --> 01:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
so jill why don't you take it from there
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
sure can you hear me yes we can okay
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
perfect um
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
well first just thank you for allowing
 
01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
me to be here again and and uh tell the
 
01:54:16.309 --> 01:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
story once again uh
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
as we've already already touched on um
 
01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:20.389 align:start position:0%
as we've already already touched on um
kovid

01:54:20.389 --> 01:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
kovid
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
affected a lot of things including ice
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
cream apparently
 
01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:24.309 align:start position:0%
cream apparently
um

01:54:24.309 --> 01:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:24.319 --> 01:54:25.110 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:54:25.110 --> 01:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
just um to
 
01:54:30.469 --> 01:54:30.479 align:start position:0%
piggyback on what representative pearl
 
01:54:32.630 --> 01:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
was saying um
 
01:54:34.150 --> 01:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
that is basically the gist of what
 
01:54:36.070 --> 01:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
happened we had been selling our raw
 
01:54:39.429 --> 01:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
goat milk ice cream um and chuck metcalf
 
01:54:40.710 --> 01:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
had brought it to our attention that
 
01:54:43.110 --> 01:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
that really wasn't uh okay under the
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
current law and he suggested we try to
 
01:54:48.469 --> 01:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
change it so um here we are and um as
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative allard had said
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
this went through the the committee no
 
01:54:54.710 --> 01:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
problem last year with a couple
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
adjustments as far as adding i believe
 
01:54:58.950 --> 01:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
um representative pearl and i had
 
01:55:01.349 --> 01:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
chatted about adding a size limitation
 
01:55:03.349 --> 01:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
on the containers and uh certainly an
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
expiration date which was no problem um
 
01:55:09.190 --> 01:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:55:10.309 --> 01:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:55:11.349 --> 01:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
you know here
 
01:55:12.389 --> 01:55:12.399 align:start position:0%
here we are having to go through all
 
01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
this again
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:18.070 align:start position:0%
the uh
what

01:55:18.070 --> 01:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:55:19.590 --> 01:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock was talking
 
01:55:21.190 --> 01:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
about with the the revenue you know
 
01:55:23.590 --> 01:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
being a small farm for us that was a
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
pretty big impact you know we we sold
 
01:55:27.670 --> 01:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
about a hundred of these little six
 
01:55:30.150 --> 01:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
ounce cups a week
 
01:55:31.670 --> 01:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
which you know ends up for us being
 
01:55:34.309 --> 01:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
about 300 a week into our farm which
 
01:55:35.910 --> 01:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
isn't a big number but when you're a
 
01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
little farm like we are that adds up um
 
01:55:40.309 --> 01:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
for sure so
 
01:55:43.429 --> 01:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
it was definitely a loss for us um and i
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
can relate to uh representative
 
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
woodcock's farm that he was talking
 
01:55:50.230 --> 01:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
about where last year you know we were
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
so sure that this was going to go
 
01:55:53.349 --> 01:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
through everybody was kind of on the
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
same page we worked very closely with
 
01:56:00.150 --> 01:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
sean jasper and um dhhs and and the farm
 
01:56:02.070 --> 01:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
bureau to make sure the language was
 
01:56:04.630 --> 01:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
right in this and we were so sure that
 
01:56:06.389 --> 01:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
we of course had our custom ice cream
 
01:56:08.150 --> 01:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
labels made and bought an ice cream
 
01:56:10.230 --> 01:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
freezer for our farm stand and we were
 
01:56:13.190 --> 01:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
ready to rock so it was definitely a
 
01:56:15.269 --> 01:56:15.279 align:start position:0%
a sort of a kick in the stomach when
 
01:56:16.630 --> 01:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen
 
01:56:19.670 --> 01:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
um but anyway here we are and um
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
i'm confident that you know that we'll
 
01:56:24.469 --> 01:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
um succeed this time
 
01:56:27.110 --> 01:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:56:29.429 --> 01:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
really i mean i i emailed
 
01:56:32.150 --> 01:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
my testimony to all of you so everybody
 
01:56:34.309 --> 01:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
should have it um you know i don't think
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
we need to go through and i'm not gonna
 
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
read it to you but i mean basically um
 
01:56:40.710 --> 01:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
it is a revenue thing as a small farmer
 
01:56:43.190 --> 01:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
and and um being able to have that extra
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
product really makes a big difference
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
for us um and it i i think that you know
 
01:56:50.389 --> 01:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
we probably
 
01:56:52.389 --> 01:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
um exhausted
 
01:56:54.309 --> 01:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
last time talking about you know how
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
this doesn't ice cream certainly doesn't
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
pose any more health risks than any of
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
the other products that are already
 
01:57:03.670 --> 01:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
allowed under the current raw milk law
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
um so you know it seems
 
01:57:09.349 --> 01:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
seems like a a no-brainer to just change
 
01:57:11.110 --> 01:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
the verbiage and and speaking of the
 
01:57:14.230 --> 01:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
verbiage i want to just say too i'm 100
 
01:57:17.590 --> 01:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
on board with removing that all you know
 
01:57:19.190 --> 01:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
i think it says like any other product
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
containing raw milk that was not the
 
01:57:24.230 --> 01:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
intention i think that was the original
 
01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:25.429 align:start position:0%
intention i think that was the original
um

01:57:25.429 --> 01:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:27.670 --> 01:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
draft when we started this journey a
 
01:57:29.190 --> 01:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
long time ago and then together with
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
dhhs and and sean jasper and everybody
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
involved we changed that and paired it
 
01:57:35.349 --> 01:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
down to just adding ice cream and i'm
 
01:57:37.190 --> 01:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
i'm totally on board with that i have no
 
01:57:38.630 --> 01:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
objection to that
 
01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:40.230 align:start position:0%
objection to that
um

01:57:40.230 --> 01:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
you know i think that
 
01:57:44.230 --> 01:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
i think that's really probably all i
 
01:57:46.150 --> 01:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
need to say today i'm i'm more than
 
01:57:47.590 --> 01:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if anyone
 
01:57:50.710 --> 01:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
has any questions for me in particular
 
01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the testimony are
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%

more background on this when this when
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
the bill was introduced it was obviously
 
01:58:50.309 --> 01:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
something that we had an interest in uh
 
01:58:52.710 --> 01:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
miss fedular is a member
 
01:58:55.670 --> 01:58:55.680 align:start position:0%

convened a meeting at farm bureau and
 
01:59:00.230 --> 01:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
this would have been it was just a fall
 
01:59:02.230 --> 01:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
prior to the to the previous bill's
 
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
introduction and at that meeting we had
 
01:59:06.309 --> 01:59:06.319 align:start position:0%

01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
who misfidula mentioned earlier
 
01:59:16.389 --> 01:59:16.399 align:start position:0%
we obviously we had
 
01:59:18.309 --> 01:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative allard as as the prime
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor and we had represent aaron as as
 
01:59:23.110 --> 01:59:23.120 align:start position:0%

01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
and we also had our president dennis

and
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
farm bureau's concern again was as the
 
01:59:42.710 --> 01:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
bill was introduced initially it had
 
01:59:44.230 --> 01:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
that language that we're you're talking
 
01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:45.269 align:start position:0%
that language that we're you're talking
about

01:59:45.269 --> 01:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:59:47.590 --> 01:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
of uh adding or any other
 
01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:48.389 align:start position:0%
of uh adding or any other
uh

01:59:48.389 --> 01:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:50.150 --> 01:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
product um
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
our dairy our dairy farmers are
 
01:59:53.590 --> 01:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
commercial farmers they have a huge
 
01:59:58.710 --> 01:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:01.590 --> 02:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
they have concerns with uh if we if this
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
raw milk statute were wide open where
 
02:00:06.469 --> 02:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
there could be any any reasons for the
 
02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
public to doubt uh uh our milk supply so
 
02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:11.670 align:start position:0%
public to doubt uh uh our milk supply so
we're

02:00:11.670 --> 02:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
we're
 
02:00:13.590 --> 02:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh we're we're comfortable with this
 
02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:14.550 align:start position:0%
uh we're we're comfortable with this
edition

02:00:14.550 --> 02:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
edition
 
02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:15.510 align:start position:0%
edition
um

02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:17.590 --> 02:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh one thing that that miss fedular
 
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
didn't get into but she has a background
 
02:00:22.710 --> 02:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
in the in the health field she does
 
02:00:25.670 --> 02:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
things the right way she and and so it
 
02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
was a it was kind of an easy and easy
 
02:00:28.710 --> 02:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
call for us
 
02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:31.269 align:start position:0%
call for us
um

02:00:31.269 --> 02:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:34.150 --> 02:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
so again i i urge for full support with
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
the removal of that language and i'd be
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions

you know thank you rob for mentioning
 
02:01:08.630 --> 02:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:01:10.230 --> 02:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
that piece i did put that in the
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that i emailed to everybody i
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
actually outlined
 
02:01:15.670 --> 02:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
our process and how stringent it is as
 
02:01:16.630 --> 02:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
far as
 
02:01:18.870 --> 02:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
handling the milk and also
 
02:01:21.190 --> 02:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
our process for milking and our cleaning
 
02:01:22.710 --> 02:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
of everything and
 
02:01:24.150 --> 02:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
that's actually something we really
 
02:01:26.389 --> 02:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
really take a lot of pride in and it's
 
02:01:27.670 --> 02:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
something that we've actually offered
 
02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
our community
 
02:01:32.150 --> 02:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
we allow other small goat herds to come
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
here and see our process we have a
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
three-based stainless steel sink down
 
02:01:39.349 --> 02:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
here that we we wash we work with roy
 
02:01:41.349 --> 02:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
glines to get all of our chemicals for
 
02:01:41.359 --> 02:01:42.469 align:start position:0%
glines to get all of our chemicals for
cleaning

02:01:42.469 --> 02:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
cleaning
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
we take that very very seriously i'm a
 
02:01:45.670 --> 02:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
nurse so i understand
 
02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:46.550 align:start position:0%
nurse so i understand
that

02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know there are risks involved and
 
02:01:49.429 --> 02:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
how important it is to make sure that
 
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're handling the raw milk carefully
 
02:01:53.269 --> 02:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
you know again we're hoping to actually
 
02:01:56.469 --> 02:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
be holding some workshops for other
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
small dairies to really learn the ins
 
02:02:00.070 --> 02:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
and outs of how to make sure they're
 
02:02:01.670 --> 02:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
can't you know keeping that raw milk
 
02:02:03.269 --> 02:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
safe and that is something that's very
 
02:02:05.190 --> 02:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
important to us i thank you rob for uh
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
mentioning that
 
02:02:09.349 --> 02:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you jill
 
02:02:10.630 --> 02:02:10.640 align:start position:0%

02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:14.560 align:start position:0%

02:02:27.190 --> 02:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
02:02:29.590 --> 02:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for allowing me to
 
02:02:31.269 --> 02:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
speak today um
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
i did provide or abby rogers from our
 
02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
department had provided my testimony in
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
advance of this bill um so this will be
 
02:02:41.910 --> 02:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
sent to you if you don't have it already
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
we would just like to
 
02:02:46.469 --> 02:02:46.479 align:start position:0%
go on the record that as the bill is
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
currently presented we we are opposed we
 
02:02:52.309 --> 02:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
would like to see that language removed
 
02:02:55.030 --> 02:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
as previously stated about the other raw
 
02:02:58.309 --> 02:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
milk products we had worked very closely
 
02:03:00.469 --> 02:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor in the past session to
 
02:03:03.670 --> 02:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
limit that to just ice cream or frozen
 
02:03:07.349 --> 02:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
yogurt um and we have concerns if again
 
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
if this was expanded to allow all raw
 
02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
milk products in particular
 
02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
soft cheeses that are made with raw milk
 
02:03:17.349 --> 02:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
have been linked to several outbreaks
 
02:03:21.269 --> 02:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
with e coli listeria in in recent years
 
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
just important to note that
 
02:03:24.710 --> 02:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
certainly there is a risk
 
02:03:27.269 --> 02:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
consuming raw milk for for foodborne
 
02:03:27.279 --> 02:03:28.630 align:start position:0%
consuming raw milk for for foodborne
illness

02:03:28.630 --> 02:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
illness
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
our data in new hampshire shows that
 
02:03:32.950 --> 02:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
over the past several years we have seen
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
an increase in foodborne illness that
 
02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:35.910 align:start position:0%
an increase in foodborne illness that
has

02:03:35.910 --> 02:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
food raw milk mentioned in their food
 
02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:39.110 align:start position:0%
food raw milk mentioned in their food
history

02:03:39.110 --> 02:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
history
 
02:03:41.349 --> 02:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
so that is a concern
 
02:03:43.190 --> 02:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
and we want to also acknowledge that
 
02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
while the current law allows for
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
raw milk to be sold at retail
 
02:03:50.550 --> 02:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
under certain
 
02:03:52.469 --> 02:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
certain quantities in certain locations
 
02:03:54.150 --> 02:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
is that there isn't currently a
 
02:03:56.309 --> 02:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
registration process for producers to
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
register or disclose on-farm or on-farm
 
02:04:02.230 --> 02:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
sales and as
 
02:04:05.110 --> 02:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
mrs fadalla mentioned
 
02:04:07.030 --> 02:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
there are some best practices that
 
02:04:08.710 --> 02:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
should be considered and the department
 
02:04:11.269 --> 02:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
would certainly support and see value in
 
02:04:13.269 --> 02:04:13.279 align:start position:0%
requiring raw milk producers to attend
 
02:04:15.590 --> 02:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
educational programs on food safety
 
02:04:18.070 --> 02:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
should funding be available so
 
02:04:19.429 --> 02:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
folks can learn
 
02:04:22.070 --> 02:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
best practices such as she incorporates
 
02:04:24.070 --> 02:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
on her farm
 
02:04:26.710 --> 02:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
that would be definitely something
 
02:04:28.550 --> 02:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
as as other stakeholders i believe would
 
02:04:30.630 --> 02:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
be in support of as well
 
02:04:32.150 --> 02:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to take any
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
questions and also want to acknowledge
 
02:04:36.230 --> 02:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
that mr chuck metcalf from our dairy
 
02:04:38.309 --> 02:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
program is also on the line if there are
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
detailed questions about the regulatory
 
02:04:43.670 --> 02:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
process for dairy farms and dairy plants
 
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%

all right thank you i don't see any
 
02:05:00.070 --> 02:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
questions appreciate your testimony
 
02:05:01.349 --> 02:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else that would like to
 
02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:11.349 --> 02:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
all right i don't see any raised hands
 
02:05:13.190 --> 02:05:13.200 align:start position:0%

so i'm presenting this build again today
 
02:18:23.510 --> 02:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
because this was one of the bills that
 
02:18:26.550 --> 02:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
ended up in an omnibus senate bill
 
02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:27.590 align:start position:0%
ended up in an omnibus senate bill
that

02:18:27.590 --> 02:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:28.630 align:start position:0%
that
got

02:18:28.630 --> 02:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
got
 
02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
killed last turn
 
02:18:33.590 --> 02:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
this was passed through our committee
 
02:18:35.590 --> 02:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
unanimously and then
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
also went through the senate and it's
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
basically very very simple
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
to update it what this uh stat what this
 
02:18:45.990 --> 02:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh proposed legislation does
 
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
is update our statutes having to do with
 
02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
noticing requirements by the department
 
02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
of environmental service
 
02:18:54.630 --> 02:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
to include electronic noticing with
 
02:18:56.469 --> 02:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
regard to giving the public timely
 
02:18:58.630 --> 02:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
information about solid waste management
 
02:18:58.640 --> 02:18:59.910 align:start position:0%
information about solid waste management
permits

02:18:59.910 --> 02:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
permits
 
02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
it provides a wider opportunity for
 
02:19:03.990 --> 02:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
public participation in significant
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
permitting decisions with potentially
 
02:19:11.429 --> 02:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:11.439 --> 02:19:13.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:19:13.030 --> 02:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
not everybody reads the newspapers these
 
02:19:16.630 --> 02:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
days but they do
 
02:19:18.630 --> 02:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
pay attention to websites and they can
 
02:19:20.309 --> 02:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
access them from their electronic
 
02:19:20.319 --> 02:19:21.910 align:start position:0%
access them from their electronic
devices

02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
devices
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
and apparently at this time the minimum
 
02:19:26.229 --> 02:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
requirements and des rules
 
02:19:28.389 --> 02:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
don't reflect the change in how public
 
02:19:30.389 --> 02:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
accesses information
 
02:19:32.550 --> 02:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
so it's time to update the statutes to
 
02:19:33.910 --> 02:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
include the way in which people are
 
02:19:36.150 --> 02:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
getting their information
 
02:19:38.309 --> 02:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
and i believe that currently des does
 
02:19:40.550 --> 02:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
voluntarily post permitting notices on
 
02:19:42.790 --> 02:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
its website but there's not as far as i
 
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
know a consistent practice spelled out
 
02:19:47.349 --> 02:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
within agency procedures rules or
 
02:19:47.359 --> 02:19:48.550 align:start position:0%
within agency procedures rules or
statutes

02:19:48.550 --> 02:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
02:19:50.309 --> 02:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
so with this addition to statute there
 
02:19:51.590 --> 02:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
will be
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
and this will be to the benefit of new
 
02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens
 
02:19:58.229 --> 02:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
so that's pretty much
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
all there is about this bill and uh
 
02:20:08.389 --> 02:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:10.389 --> 02:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
02:20:17.110 --> 02:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:19.269 --> 02:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
this may be a record for the fastest
 
02:20:24.300 --> 02:20:24.310 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:24.310 --> 02:20:28.389 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:30.790 --> 02:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else that would like to testify
 
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
if you're in the
 
02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:44.950 --> 02:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
all right i see no hands
 
02:20:48.630 --> 02:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
i will read the blue sheet we have
 
02:20:49.990 --> 02:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
four members
 
02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
reporting three in support and one
 
02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:54.070 align:start position:0%
reporting three in support and one
neutral

02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
and i will close the hearing on house
 
02:20:58.950 --> 02:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
bill 73
 
02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
our next hearing will be at 3 45 which
 
02:21:06.229 --> 02:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
will be house bill 199
 
02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
so um just a question that's not related
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
to the bill howard do you have a sense
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
of um
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
when we're likely to be doing the execs
 
02:21:17.190 --> 02:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
on these bills
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
i'll turn my mic back on sure
 
02:21:21.990 --> 02:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
i have scheduled some executive
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
session work next week at the end of our
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh hearing schedule
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh the hearing schedule will be out in
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
the calendar but i've got the uh
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
the landfill bill for the afternoon
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
starting at one and i estimate that will
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
be two to three hours of testimony based
 
02:21:40.229 --> 02:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
upon the amount of
 
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that we had last year when we
 
02:21:43.110 --> 02:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
heard it
 
02:21:45.429 --> 02:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
so as soon as that testimony is complete
 
02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
we will be picking up checking on
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
most if not all hopefully all of these
 
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
bills that we heard today
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
as long as we're able to do it
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
so that that's the general plan
 
02:21:58.870 --> 02:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you you're welcome
 
02:22:00.550 --> 02:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
any other committee questions while we
 
02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
i don't see any other hands all right
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
then we will uh
 
02:44:53.189 --> 02:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:53.199 --> 02:45:08.550 align:start position:0%
 
because

02:45:08.550 --> 02:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
i cut wood so i'm outside all day by
 
02:46:05.189 --> 02:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:05.199 --> 02:46:10.469 align:start position:0%
 
this

02:46:10.469 --> 02:46:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:10.479 --> 02:46:24.469 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:46:24.469 --> 02:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:24.479 --> 02:47:10.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:47:10.630 --> 02:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:30.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:42.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:47:42.389 --> 02:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:45.830 --> 02:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
all right cena's is 3 45 i'm going to
 
02:47:49.750 --> 02:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on house bill 199 an
 
02:47:52.150 --> 02:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
act including soil health and soil
 
02:47:54.309 --> 02:47:54.319 align:start position:0%

02:47:56.309 --> 02:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
conservation plan
 
02:47:59.030 --> 02:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
and i will call on representative bixty
 
02:48:01.910 --> 02:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
to introduce the bill
 
02:48:04.389 --> 02:48:04.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for the record i'm
 
02:48:06.550 --> 02:48:06.560 align:start position:0%

house environment and agriculture
committee

02:48:16.630 --> 02:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:18.309 align:start position:0%
committee
so

02:48:18.309 --> 02:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:21.110 --> 02:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
this bill was voted otpa by our
 
02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:22.229 align:start position:0%
this bill was voted otpa by our
committee

02:48:22.229 --> 02:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:48:24.469 --> 02:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
and by the house last year after
 
02:48:26.389 --> 02:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative pearl and roger noonan of
 
02:48:28.229 --> 02:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire farmers new england
 
02:48:30.389 --> 02:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
farmers union worked out mutually
 
02:48:32.630 --> 02:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
agreeable language it was then tabled in
 
02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
02:48:33.680 --> 02:48:34.710 align:start position:0%
the senate
and

02:48:34.710 --> 02:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:36.550 --> 02:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
what i have done is simply
 
02:48:38.389 --> 02:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
taken the version that was tabled in the
 
02:48:40.830 --> 02:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
senate and resubmitted it
 
02:48:43.990 --> 02:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
um so a little bit of
 
02:48:46.309 --> 02:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh i just wanted i wanted to cover what
 
02:48:48.070 --> 02:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
for those who weren't here last year i i
 
02:48:49.429 --> 02:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
want to cover
 
02:48:50.950 --> 02:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
a bit of history and what the bill does
 
02:48:52.309 --> 02:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
and doesn't do
 
02:48:54.150 --> 02:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
first of all what the bill does not do
 
02:48:56.070 --> 02:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
this bill does not tell farmers what to
 
02:48:56.080 --> 02:48:57.750 align:start position:0%
this bill does not tell farmers what to
do

02:48:57.750 --> 02:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:49:00.389 --> 02:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
and it also does not impose new
 
02:49:02.309 --> 02:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
requirements on the soil conservation
 
02:49:02.319 --> 02:49:03.590 align:start position:0%
requirements on the soil conservation
districts

02:49:03.590 --> 02:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:49:05.990 --> 02:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh that being said i'd just like to go
 
02:49:08.309 --> 02:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
back to um give a little bit of history
 
02:49:10.469 --> 02:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
about where soil conservation districts
 
02:49:12.550 --> 02:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
came from and
 
02:49:14.870 --> 02:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
how we've ended up here so
 
02:49:16.950 --> 02:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
back in the 1930s
 
02:49:18.630 --> 02:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
as a result of
 
02:49:21.349 --> 02:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
severe drought and
 
02:49:23.750 --> 02:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
problematic farming practices
 
02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
there was a massive wind erosion event
 
02:49:27.510 --> 02:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
called the dust bowl
 
02:49:29.830 --> 02:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
clouds of dust traveled
 
02:49:32.710 --> 02:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
from as far as oklahoma to
 
02:49:35.110 --> 02:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
washington dc where they blocked out the
 
02:49:37.429 --> 02:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
sun in dc
 
02:49:39.269 --> 02:49:39.279 align:start position:0%
the federal government figured out that
 
02:49:41.750 --> 02:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
this was a problem and they required
 
02:49:44.469 --> 02:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
states to create uh state soil
 
02:49:48.070 --> 02:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
conservation plans and they also created
 
02:49:50.550 --> 02:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
the soil conservation service which was
 
02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
later renamed to the natural resources
 
02:49:56.070 --> 02:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
conservation service or nrcs and you
 
02:49:58.309 --> 02:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
have probably seen reference to nrcs
 
02:50:02.630 --> 02:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:05.510 --> 02:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
so soil conservation districts are
 
02:50:07.750 --> 02:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
essentially the working arm of the state
 
02:50:09.429 --> 02:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
soil plan
 
02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
and they provide
 
02:50:13.110 --> 02:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
education and technical assistance to
 
02:50:16.309 --> 02:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
farmers and to landowners
 
02:50:18.469 --> 02:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
the last revision of the
 
02:50:20.309 --> 02:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire soil conservation plan
 
02:50:23.910 --> 02:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
took place in 1985 uh with some minor
 
02:50:27.349 --> 02:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
changes in 1995 and at that point
 
02:50:30.070 --> 02:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh it was essentially bringing the idea
 
02:50:32.229 --> 02:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
of um
 
02:50:35.030 --> 02:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
making making sure that uh soil
 
02:50:37.030 --> 02:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
conservation was done in a way to
 
02:50:39.670 --> 02:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
minimize impact on waterways
 
02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:40.630 align:start position:0%
minimize impact on waterways
uh

02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:41.510 align:start position:0%
uh
and

02:50:41.510 --> 02:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh in the 1980s one of the main focuses
 
02:50:47.830 --> 02:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
of soil science was the physical soil
 
02:50:49.830 --> 02:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
structure and the and soil nutrient
 
02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:51.189 align:start position:0%
structure and the and soil nutrient
chemistry

02:50:51.189 --> 02:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
chemistry
 
02:50:54.229 --> 02:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh since that time especially since
 
02:50:56.309 --> 02:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
around 2000
 
02:50:58.550 --> 02:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
a lot more attention has been paid to
 
02:51:00.710 --> 02:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
soil biological activity and soil
 
02:51:02.469 --> 02:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
organic matter
 
02:51:02.479 --> 02:51:04.389 align:start position:0%
organic matter
and

02:51:04.389 --> 02:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:51:06.710 --> 02:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
the understanding of how
 
02:51:10.309 --> 02:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
the microorganisms in soil
 
02:51:12.229 --> 02:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
profoundly affect the nutrient
 
02:51:13.590 --> 02:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
capacities of the soil the
 
02:51:16.389 --> 02:51:16.399 align:start position:0%
nutrient-holding ability of soil the
 
02:51:19.590 --> 02:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:22.550 --> 02:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
holding ability of soil and the general
 
02:51:24.309 --> 02:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
resilience of soil
 
02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
have really
 
02:51:28.870 --> 02:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
changed the way that we understand how
 
02:51:31.030 --> 02:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
we need to work with soils
 
02:51:32.870 --> 02:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
and how we need to
 
02:51:34.950 --> 02:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
particularly work with soils to
 
02:51:38.389 --> 02:51:38.399 align:start position:0%
improve that biological activity
 
02:51:40.070 --> 02:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
and the term that
 
02:51:42.550 --> 02:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
has been given to resilient soils with a
 
02:51:44.710 --> 02:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
lot of biological activity
 
02:51:46.389 --> 02:51:46.399 align:start position:0%
is healthy soils
 
02:51:50.950 --> 02:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
the ag ag school at cornell university
 
02:51:56.150 --> 02:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
but it's all it's something that is
 
02:51:57.750 --> 02:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
being broadly
 
02:51:59.750 --> 02:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
investigated throughout the country and
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
it is something that
 
02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of major agricultural producers
 
02:52:06.150 --> 02:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
are also really starting to pay
 
02:52:08.950 --> 02:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:12.150 --> 02:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
so what the bill does is it brings the
 
02:52:14.630 --> 02:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
science in the state soil conservation
 
02:52:16.550 --> 02:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
plan up to date
 
02:52:18.150 --> 02:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
to include
 
02:52:20.150 --> 02:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
soil that the term soil health and
 
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
related concepts
 
02:52:24.070 --> 02:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
it also recognizes the good work that
 
02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
our soil conservation districts are
 
02:52:29.110 --> 02:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
already doing uh related to soil health
 
02:52:29.120 --> 02:52:29.830 align:start position:0%
already doing uh related to soil health
so

02:52:29.830 --> 02:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:31.189 align:start position:0%
so
uh

02:52:31.189 --> 02:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:33.269 --> 02:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of the work that
 
02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
many soil conservation districts in new
 
02:52:37.670 --> 02:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire are doing at this point uh
 
02:52:39.910 --> 02:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
involves things like
 
02:52:43.349 --> 02:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
helping farmers with cover cropping
 
02:52:43.359 --> 02:52:44.469 align:start position:0%
helping farmers with cover cropping
providing

02:52:44.469 --> 02:52:44.479 align:start position:0%
providing
 
02:52:46.710 --> 02:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
low-cost rental for equipment such as
 
02:52:50.229 --> 02:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
aeration equipment seed drills
 
02:52:50.239 --> 02:52:52.710 align:start position:0%
aeration equipment seed drills
and

02:52:52.710 --> 02:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:54.389 --> 02:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
cover crop crimpers
 
02:52:54.399 --> 02:52:55.269 align:start position:0%
cover crop crimpers
uh

02:52:55.269 --> 02:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:56.950 --> 02:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
and because
 
02:52:59.030 --> 02:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
these pieces of require of equipment are
 
02:53:00.790 --> 02:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
expensive and
 
02:53:02.870 --> 02:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
only get used two or three times a year
 
02:53:04.070 --> 02:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
at most
 
02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh by having a a rental pool of them in
 
02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
the county it means that a lot of small
 
02:53:11.349 --> 02:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
landowners and farmers can take
 
02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
advantage of them without that capital
 
02:53:13.040 --> 02:53:16.790 align:start position:0%
advantage of them without that capital
expense

02:53:16.790 --> 02:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:20.790 --> 02:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
and uh so uh another so
 
02:53:23.429 --> 02:53:23.439 align:start position:0%
um so we're basically recognizing that
 
02:53:25.349 --> 02:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
they are already working on these things
 
02:53:28.070 --> 02:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
and uh it should be recognized in what
 
02:53:30.870 --> 02:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
is essentially their charter uh
 
02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
document which is this the state soil
 
02:53:32.880 --> 02:53:35.269 align:start position:0%
document which is this the state soil
statute

02:53:35.269 --> 02:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:53:37.269 --> 02:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
the other thing uh another key thing
 
02:53:39.510 --> 02:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
this bill will do is it will provide
 
02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:40.710 align:start position:0%
this bill will do is it will provide
language

02:53:40.710 --> 02:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:53:44.070 --> 02:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
essentially in their in the statute
 
02:53:46.550 --> 02:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
that they can point to and say
 
02:53:48.870 --> 02:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
when we're applying for this grant
 
02:53:50.389 --> 02:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
we are fulfilling the
 
02:53:53.670 --> 02:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
the requirements of um the state
 
02:53:55.349 --> 02:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
statutes and
 
02:53:58.469 --> 02:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
the state is behind us on on uh in this
 
02:54:00.309 --> 02:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
project and
 
02:54:01.910 --> 02:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
that makes for much stronger grant
 
02:54:05.269 --> 02:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
application uh and which brings me to
 
02:54:07.510 --> 02:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
another topic which is you know
 
02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
how are soil conservation districts
 
02:54:09.520 --> 02:54:10.870 align:start position:0%
how are soil conservation districts
funded

02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
funded
 
02:54:12.389 --> 02:54:12.399 align:start position:0%
they are largely
 
02:54:12.399 --> 02:54:14.070 align:start position:0%
they are largely
um

02:54:14.070 --> 02:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
one part of their co of their funding
 
02:54:17.269 --> 02:54:17.279 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
02:54:19.189 --> 02:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:54:21.670 --> 02:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
what the counties decide to give them
 
02:54:22.790 --> 02:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
each county
 
02:54:25.349 --> 02:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
has a soil conservation
 
02:54:27.670 --> 02:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
district line in this budget
 
02:54:27.680 --> 02:54:28.870 align:start position:0%
district line in this budget
and

02:54:28.870 --> 02:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:30.630 --> 02:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
the what the counties provide is
 
02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
generally the fundamental support for
 
02:54:37.269 --> 02:54:37.279 align:start position:0%
staff and administrative costs
 
02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of
 
02:54:42.550 --> 02:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
the projects the education and technical
 
02:54:45.110 --> 02:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
assistance projects that they do
 
02:54:48.630 --> 02:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
they the districts generally
 
02:54:50.309 --> 02:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
apply for grants in order to get the
 
02:54:54.550 --> 02:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
money to do that and uh the more
 
02:54:56.309 --> 02:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
the better the more and better grants
 
02:54:58.389 --> 02:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
they can get the more they can do for
 
02:55:01.510 --> 02:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
our farmers
 
02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:02.950 align:start position:0%
our farmers
so

02:55:02.950 --> 02:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:06.070 --> 02:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of the the nrcs is one of the main
 
02:55:08.070 --> 02:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
granting agencies
 
02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:09.189 align:start position:0%
granting agencies
but

02:55:09.189 --> 02:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:55:13.189 --> 02:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
with a broader interest in soil
 
02:55:14.389 --> 02:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
soil health
 
02:55:15.990 --> 02:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:55:18.389 --> 02:55:18.399 align:start position:0%
becoming apparent throughout the
 
02:55:18.399 --> 02:55:19.510 align:start position:0%
becoming apparent throughout the
um

02:55:19.510 --> 02:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:22.950 --> 02:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
multination the the
 
02:55:26.309 --> 02:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
farming community across the country
 
02:55:29.110 --> 02:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
organ organizations like cargill general
 
02:55:30.870 --> 02:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
mills walden family foundation
 
02:55:32.389 --> 02:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
foundation for food and agriculture
 
02:55:34.710 --> 02:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
research these organizations have taken
 
02:55:36.550 --> 02:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
an interest in soil health
 
02:55:39.429 --> 02:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
and uh they
 
02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
are probably
 
02:55:44.389 --> 02:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh establishing grants that would
 
02:55:44.399 --> 02:55:45.349 align:start position:0%
uh establishing grants that would
be

02:55:45.349 --> 02:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:55:47.189 --> 02:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
that our conservation districts could
 
02:55:48.469 --> 02:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
apply for
 
02:55:52.070 --> 02:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh having this language in this statute
 
02:55:53.349 --> 02:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh will
 
02:55:57.510 --> 02:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
strengthen their case um
 
02:55:57.520 --> 02:55:59.750 align:start position:0%
strengthen their case um
so

02:55:59.750 --> 02:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:56:01.189 --> 02:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:56:02.710 --> 02:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
um the key
 
02:56:04.870 --> 02:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh the core ideas in this bill are
 
02:56:06.870 --> 02:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
providing a definition of soil health
 
02:56:10.229 --> 02:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
and providing some uh
 
02:56:10.239 --> 02:56:11.349 align:start position:0%
and providing some uh
information

02:56:11.349 --> 02:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:56:14.469 --> 02:56:14.479 align:start position:0%
some guiding ideas about the benefits of
 
02:56:17.670 --> 02:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
since

02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
since
 
02:56:20.550 --> 02:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
the person who
 
02:56:22.309 --> 02:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
did the primary drafting of this
 
02:56:25.910 --> 02:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
language uh was roger noonan of the
 
02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:26.790 align:start position:0%
language uh was roger noonan of the
um

02:56:26.790 --> 02:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:29.189 --> 02:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
new england farmers union who is
 
02:56:32.469 --> 02:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
also a small farmer himself has been uh
 
02:56:34.710 --> 02:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
and are a certified organic farmer for
 
02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:35.590 align:start position:0%
and are a certified organic farmer for
years

02:56:35.590 --> 02:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:56:36.870 --> 02:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh i will
 
02:56:38.870 --> 02:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
turn more of the explanation of the bill
 
02:56:41.110 --> 02:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
over to him uh if
 
02:56:42.870 --> 02:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
i'd be willing to take questions but in
 
02:56:44.870 --> 02:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
many cases i might just bump those
 
02:56:48.070 --> 02:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:49.590 --> 02:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:56:51.429 --> 02:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
02:56:53.510 --> 02:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative bixby or i might suggest
 
02:56:55.750 --> 02:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
honestly that we hold off and let uh mr
 
02:56:57.269 --> 02:56:57.279 align:start position:0%
noon into his testimony and then we'll
 
02:57:00.150 --> 02:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
ask questions of both if that's okay
 
02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:01.030 align:start position:0%
ask questions of both if that's okay
sure

02:57:01.030 --> 02:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:02.070 align:start position:0%
sure
but

02:57:02.070 --> 02:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:57:04.309 --> 02:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
i'm going to call up roger noonan from
 
02:57:06.950 --> 02:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
the new england farmers union
 
02:57:09.030 --> 02:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman pearl
 
02:57:10.950 --> 02:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
and ranking member bixby members of the
 
02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:12.070 align:start position:0%
and ranking member bixby members of the
committee

02:57:12.070 --> 02:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:57:14.469 --> 02:57:14.479 align:start position:0%
i'm roger noonan i'm a small family
 
02:57:16.070 --> 02:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
farmer in new boston new hampshire
 
02:57:18.389 --> 02:57:18.399 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county
 
02:57:20.070 --> 02:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
served as a president of the new england
 
02:57:22.150 --> 02:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
farmer's union farm bureau member nofa
 
02:57:23.830 --> 02:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire member member of more
 
02:57:25.830 --> 02:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
things and i can shake a stick at a
 
02:57:28.630 --> 02:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
former conservation district supervisor
 
02:57:31.269 --> 02:57:31.279 align:start position:0%
in hillsborough county
 
02:57:33.349 --> 02:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
we worked with nofa new hampshire and a
 
02:57:36.150 --> 02:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
couple of other uh stakeholders in
 
02:57:37.830 --> 02:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
looking at ways to address some of the
 
02:57:39.910 --> 02:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
challenges that we were seeing relative
 
02:57:41.670 --> 02:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
to climate change and extreme weather
 
02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:42.710 align:start position:0%
to climate change and extreme weather
events

02:57:42.710 --> 02:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
events
 
02:57:44.309 --> 02:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh i think any of you that are involved
 
02:57:46.070 --> 02:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
in agriculture know we had a we had a
 
02:57:47.269 --> 02:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
drought last year and we had another
 
02:57:49.590 --> 02:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
drought in 2016 we
 
02:57:51.349 --> 02:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
we can get too much rain in the same
 
02:57:53.510 --> 02:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
year we're not having enough rain
 
02:57:55.030 --> 02:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of challenges and when
 
02:57:56.870 --> 02:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
you're a small farm as peter pointed out
 
02:57:59.110 --> 02:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
you know some of this these
 
02:58:00.870 --> 02:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
this equipment you know you really can't
 
02:58:02.550 --> 02:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
justify the cost of purchasing some of
 
02:58:04.469 --> 02:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
this stuff when you're only running 10
 
02:58:06.710 --> 02:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
20 30 40 acres you know
 
02:58:08.630 --> 02:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
so the fact that we can share this
 
02:58:11.429 --> 02:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
equipment amongst a bunch of uh
 
02:58:13.349 --> 02:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
farms in the county is is a real
 
02:58:15.830 --> 02:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
multiplier for us
 
02:58:17.990 --> 02:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
more importantly i think what as peter
 
02:58:20.229 --> 02:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
also laid out this is just an update of
 
02:58:21.910 --> 02:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
the bill you know this started out with
 
02:58:24.309 --> 02:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
a dust bowl addressing soil loss
 
02:58:26.550 --> 02:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
from erosion wind and water erosion then
 
02:58:27.990 --> 02:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
in the 80s
 
02:58:29.830 --> 02:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
it was addressing some water quality
 
02:58:29.840 --> 02:58:30.870 align:start position:0%
it was addressing some water quality
issues

02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:58:33.510 --> 02:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh soil health sort of pulls all of the
 
02:58:35.590 --> 02:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
above together into a into a broad
 
02:58:37.510 --> 02:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
bucket now that we're recognizing that
 
02:58:38.870 --> 02:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
the soil is
 
02:58:40.309 --> 02:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
where it all starts
 
02:58:41.910 --> 02:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
um and we've got to maintain good
 
02:58:43.269 --> 02:58:43.279 align:start position:0%
quality soil
 
02:58:45.349 --> 02:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
and the other uh
 
02:58:47.830 --> 02:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
and the other part is the adaptation and
 
02:58:50.309 --> 02:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
mitigation of a change in climate and
 
02:58:52.229 --> 02:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
adaptation is probably the most
 
02:58:53.750 --> 02:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
important thing for those of us in new
 
02:58:55.750 --> 02:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire we don't i don't i mean there
 
02:58:57.429 --> 02:58:57.439 align:start position:0%
may be some farms and especially some of
 
02:58:58.630 --> 02:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
our dairy farms that can get into
 
02:59:00.630 --> 02:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
digesters and that'll have some there'll
 
02:59:03.030 --> 02:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
be some mitigation uh opportunities
 
02:59:04.389 --> 02:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
there where they can get paid for
 
02:59:06.630 --> 02:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
sequester and carbon in different ways
 
02:59:08.950 --> 02:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
but for a lot of our small farms that's
 
02:59:11.670 --> 02:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be a real uh
 
02:59:14.950 --> 02:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
goal but adapting you know providing uh
 
02:59:17.830 --> 02:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
improving our soil health our practices
 
02:59:20.070 --> 02:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
to make our land more resilient to
 
02:59:22.150 --> 02:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
excess moisture or
 
02:59:24.790 --> 02:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
these extreme droughts um that's the the
 
02:59:27.349 --> 02:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
real crux of this uh bill
 
02:59:29.269 --> 02:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh it provides it's just providing
 
02:59:32.550 --> 02:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
explicit statutory language uh to allow
 
02:59:35.110 --> 02:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
for these things and peter made another
 
02:59:37.830 --> 02:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
great point about grant writing when if
 
02:59:39.590 --> 02:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
anyone's been involved in non-profits
 
02:59:41.269 --> 02:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
when you put in for a grant you know the
 
02:59:42.870 --> 02:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
the key thing that most funders look at
 
02:59:44.550 --> 02:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
would you be doing this anyway are you
 
02:59:47.189 --> 02:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
just putting in for this because there's
 
02:59:49.189 --> 02:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of money out in the uh
 
02:59:51.030 --> 02:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
the grant a sphere
 
02:59:52.630 --> 02:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
for that particular action so this
 
02:59:54.550 --> 02:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
provides explicit language
 
02:59:55.670 --> 02:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:59:57.510 --> 02:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
help our conservation districts get out
 
02:59:59.830 --> 02:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
there and get the the public and the
 
03:00:02.630 --> 03:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
private money to help our small farms
 
03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
cope with this work thanks and i'll be
 
03:00:06.830 --> 03:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
03:00:09.670 --> 03:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
questions you roger uh representative
 
03:00:12.710 --> 03:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
aaron has a question for you
 
03:00:14.870 --> 03:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
03:00:20.830 --> 03:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:23.189 --> 03:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh help our conservation districts but
 
03:00:26.550 --> 03:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'm curious to know a little bit more
 
03:00:29.189 --> 03:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
i see the definition of soil health in
 
03:00:29.199 --> 03:00:30.710 align:start position:0%
i see the definition of soil health in
this

03:00:30.710 --> 03:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:00:32.469 --> 03:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
in this language here
 
03:00:34.870 --> 03:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
but i'm interested to know is is there
 
03:00:34.880 --> 03:00:36.389 align:start position:0%
but i'm interested to know is is there
more

03:00:36.389 --> 03:00:36.399 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:00:36.399 --> 03:00:37.590 align:start position:0%
more
to

03:00:37.590 --> 03:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:00:40.790 --> 03:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
soil health and so far as
 
03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:41.670 align:start position:0%
soil health and so far as
um

03:00:41.670 --> 03:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:43.830 --> 03:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
more measurable
 
03:00:45.910 --> 03:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
statistics of
 
03:00:45.920 --> 03:00:46.950 align:start position:0%
statistics of
uh

03:00:46.950 --> 03:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:00:49.510 --> 03:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know how much organic matter and the
 
03:00:51.349 --> 03:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
holding capacity of the soil and so
 
03:00:54.229 --> 03:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
forth and if so do do you look at that
 
03:00:54.239 --> 03:00:55.030 align:start position:0%
forth and if so do do you look at that
or

03:00:55.030 --> 03:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:00:57.189 --> 03:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
is that looked at
 
03:00:57.199 --> 03:00:58.150 align:start position:0%
is that looked at
uh

03:00:58.150 --> 03:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:01:00.150 --> 03:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
from an average standpoint throughout
 
03:01:03.189 --> 03:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
the state or in specific areas of the
 
03:01:05.110 --> 03:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
state i mean
 
03:01:08.309 --> 03:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
our soil health is different from
 
03:01:09.910 --> 03:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know town to town district to
 
03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:11.269 align:start position:0%
you know town to town district to
district

03:01:11.269 --> 03:01:11.279 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:01:11.279 --> 03:01:12.229 align:start position:0%
district
so

03:01:12.229 --> 03:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:01:13.750 --> 03:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
how is this
 
03:01:15.510 --> 03:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
how does this help
 
03:01:17.670 --> 03:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
so the the definition of soil health
 
03:01:20.070 --> 03:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
care is sort of a broad one
 
03:01:22.950 --> 03:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
as as anyone that's that's involved in
 
03:01:24.950 --> 03:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
natural resources
 
03:01:27.590 --> 03:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
we know that you know there's a lot of
 
03:01:29.750 --> 03:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
specificity related to any particular
 
03:01:32.309 --> 03:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
site uh i've got fields even small
 
03:01:34.790 --> 03:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
fields 10 acres or less that i can go i
 
03:01:36.070 --> 03:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
can probably find three or four
 
03:01:38.229 --> 03:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
different very radically different soil
 
03:01:41.030 --> 03:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
types you know glacial till to sandy
 
03:01:43.910 --> 03:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
stuff down by the riverbank and you know
 
03:01:46.070 --> 03:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
heavy clay a little clay patch where we
 
03:01:47.429 --> 03:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
used to make bricks a couple hundred
 
03:01:49.910 --> 03:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
years ago uh so it doesn't really
 
03:01:51.750 --> 03:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
address it's not
 
03:01:54.070 --> 03:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
a soil typology as opposed to a set of
 
03:01:54.080 --> 03:01:55.189 align:start position:0%
a soil typology as opposed to a set of
conditions

03:01:55.189 --> 03:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
03:01:55.199 --> 03:01:56.389 align:start position:0%
conditions
um

03:01:56.389 --> 03:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:56.399 --> 03:01:57.670 align:start position:0%
um
that

03:01:57.670 --> 03:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:59.990 --> 03:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
that indicate good soil health you know
 
03:02:01.110 --> 03:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
you want you know you want good
 
03:02:01.120 --> 03:02:02.950 align:start position:0%
you want you know you want good
permeability

03:02:02.950 --> 03:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
permeability
 
03:02:04.229 --> 03:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
organic matter and that's going to be
 
03:02:05.590 --> 03:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
real you know
 
03:02:07.269 --> 03:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
organic matter is
 
03:02:08.630 --> 03:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
you know some soils will have higher
 
03:02:10.950 --> 03:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
organic matter than others naturally and
 
03:02:13.110 --> 03:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
others will be depleted either through
 
03:02:16.550 --> 03:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
human or other interventions as well so
 
03:02:18.710 --> 03:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's not um
 
03:02:20.630 --> 03:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
this isn't sort of a thing where you say
 
03:02:23.110 --> 03:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
this is good soil health and and here's
 
03:02:24.950 --> 03:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
your you know here's your merit badge
 
03:02:26.150 --> 03:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
for your good soil health and there's
 
03:02:27.830 --> 03:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
one standard that fits all but it's sort
 
03:02:30.150 --> 03:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
of a set of parameters that many
 
03:02:33.670 --> 03:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
different soil types can fit into
 
03:02:35.990 --> 03:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
i can also pick up a little bit on that
 
03:02:38.229 --> 03:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
cornell university has actually come up
 
03:02:39.910 --> 03:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
with a
 
03:02:41.910 --> 03:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
broad set of different soil
 
03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:43.269 align:start position:0%
broad set of different soil
characteristics

03:02:43.269 --> 03:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
characteristics
 
03:02:45.670 --> 03:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
including things like cation exchange
 
03:02:48.630 --> 03:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
capacity organic matter content
 
03:02:50.790 --> 03:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
and the organic matter content divided
 
03:02:52.469 --> 03:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
into several different categories of
 
03:02:53.910 --> 03:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
organic matter
 
03:02:55.830 --> 03:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
03:02:59.269 --> 03:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
different nutrient holding capacities
 
03:03:01.349 --> 03:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
levels of
 
03:03:02.790 --> 03:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
humic and
 
03:03:04.229 --> 03:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
fulvic acid
 
03:03:04.239 --> 03:03:05.750 align:start position:0%
fulvic acid
uh

03:03:05.750 --> 03:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:03:07.269 --> 03:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
and they have
 
03:03:09.750 --> 03:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
made a very broad panel of all of these
 
03:03:12.389 --> 03:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
characteristics and
 
03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
you can send your soil a soil test
 
03:03:16.389 --> 03:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
sample off to cornell and they will give
 
03:03:17.910 --> 03:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
you a very
 
03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:19.269 align:start position:0%
you a very
detailed

03:03:19.269 --> 03:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
detailed
 
03:03:21.510 --> 03:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
analysis of what the soil health looks
 
03:03:23.510 --> 03:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
like i think another element of that
 
03:03:25.590 --> 03:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
might also be the the types of
 
03:03:27.510 --> 03:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
microorganisms found
 
03:03:30.229 --> 03:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
and and fungi found within the soil uh
 
03:03:30.239 --> 03:03:31.750 align:start position:0%
and and fungi found within the soil uh
so

03:03:31.750 --> 03:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:03:34.630 --> 03:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh there are uh actually
 
03:03:36.870 --> 03:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
um sort of physically
 
03:03:40.710 --> 03:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
measurable uh parameters for this and
 
03:03:43.110 --> 03:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
beyond what i've just told you uh it's a
 
03:03:47.189 --> 03:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:50.710 --> 03:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you i appreciate that
 
03:03:51.910 --> 03:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank you both uh
 
03:03:55.349 --> 03:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
representative hamola has a question
 
03:03:58.150 --> 03:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr noonan for coming in and uh
 
03:04:00.550 --> 03:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
and presenting this to us today i'm i'm
 
03:04:02.150 --> 03:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
actually very interested in this i'm a
 
03:04:03.910 --> 03:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
natural hazard mitigation planner in my
 
03:04:06.229 --> 03:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
day job and i've actually had my hand in
 
03:04:08.710 --> 03:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
statement mitigation plans so i
 
03:04:11.269 --> 03:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate the enormity of this uh the
 
03:04:12.790 --> 03:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
one i have two questions the first
 
03:04:15.349 --> 03:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
question is on page two
 
03:04:23.670 --> 03:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:25.110 --> 03:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
definition for this that's more
 
03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:26.229 align:start position:0%
definition for this that's more
generally

03:04:26.229 --> 03:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
generally
 
03:04:28.389 --> 03:04:28.399 align:start position:0%
um universally accepted in this
 
03:04:30.710 --> 03:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
definition is a little bit more tailored
 
03:04:32.070 --> 03:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering if this
 
03:04:35.030 --> 03:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
definition is tailored specifically
 
03:04:36.229 --> 03:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
so that
 
03:04:38.389 --> 03:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
the state plan has a
 
03:04:41.189 --> 03:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
kind of a better chance at getting
 
03:04:41.199 --> 03:04:43.110 align:start position:0%
kind of a better chance at getting
grants

03:04:43.110 --> 03:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
grants
 
03:04:46.309 --> 03:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
so i i'm i'm sorry representative um i
 
03:04:49.110 --> 03:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
did not uh you were a little
 
03:04:51.910 --> 03:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
sort of soft i couldn't quite hear you
 
03:04:51.920 --> 03:04:54.630 align:start position:0%
sort of soft i couldn't quite hear you
um

03:04:54.630 --> 03:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:59.269 --> 03:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you can you hear me better now
 
03:05:03.590 --> 03:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
very well thank you thank you so much um
 
03:05:05.189 --> 03:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
i was saying that i'm actually a hazard
 
03:05:07.670 --> 03:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
mitigation planner my day job and so i
 
03:05:10.469 --> 03:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate the um what you're trying to
 
03:05:13.510 --> 03:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
do here very much uh page two on the
 
03:05:13.520 --> 03:05:14.309 align:start position:0%
do here very much uh page two on the
bill

03:05:14.309 --> 03:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:05:17.189 --> 03:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
was giving the definitions of things and
 
03:05:19.269 --> 03:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
it gave a definition for mitigation that
 
03:05:21.349 --> 03:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
is is not a generally universally
 
03:05:23.510 --> 03:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
accepted definition of mitigation it's a
 
03:05:25.349 --> 03:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
more tailored version and i'm just
 
03:05:28.790 --> 03:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if that was by design to allow
 
03:05:32.870 --> 03:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
the um the agency to apply to grants
 
03:05:35.030 --> 03:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
that are more tailored towards climate
 
03:05:35.040 --> 03:05:36.389 align:start position:0%
that are more tailored towards climate
change

03:05:36.389 --> 03:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:05:39.269 --> 03:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
um well i would defer to your
 
03:05:41.510 --> 03:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
professional experience on on broader
 
03:05:43.590 --> 03:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
terms of mitigation but
 
03:05:45.429 --> 03:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
this one we basically lifted from the
 
03:05:46.950 --> 03:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
u.s department of agriculture's natural
 
03:05:49.110 --> 03:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
resource conservation service
 
03:05:51.189 --> 03:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
in so far as it applies
 
03:05:52.790 --> 03:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know to those things that they're
 
03:05:55.830 --> 03:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
working on and have been working on um
 
03:05:55.840 --> 03:05:56.630 align:start position:0%
working on and have been working on um
in

03:05:56.630 --> 03:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:05:58.469 --> 03:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
you know since the uh the boy shoot i
 
03:06:00.790 --> 03:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
think this original definition was
 
03:06:04.070 --> 03:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
developed uh under uh the previous
 
03:06:06.870 --> 03:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
iteration of secretary vilsack's term um
 
03:06:08.790 --> 03:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
that's been the working definition i'm
 
03:06:10.830 --> 03:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
involved with some national groups
 
03:06:13.910 --> 03:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
um that are working with industry
 
03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
partners and these are sort of the
 
03:06:20.790 --> 03:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
the terms that were being used okay
 
03:06:22.710 --> 03:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and um the second question i
 
03:06:25.590 --> 03:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
had is there anything in the state plan
 
03:06:28.710 --> 03:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
currently that prohibits a discussion on
 
03:06:33.670 --> 03:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:35.269 --> 03:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
03:06:37.510 --> 03:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's a great question i
 
03:06:39.990 --> 03:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
would like to see the state plan i don't
 
03:06:41.990 --> 03:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i've ever seen one
 
03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:43.429 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i've ever seen one
so

03:06:43.429 --> 03:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:45.110 --> 03:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay i just i'm asking the reason i'm
 
03:06:47.189 --> 03:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
asking is just because i'm trying to
 
03:06:49.429 --> 03:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
understand i know that when i i do plans
 
03:06:52.790 --> 03:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
there's the the plan writer has the
 
03:06:54.469 --> 03:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
ability to write
 
03:06:57.349 --> 03:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that needs to be to cover
 
03:06:59.750 --> 03:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
how they want to talk about
 
03:07:02.229 --> 03:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
um talk about the subject and it's not
 
03:07:03.670 --> 03:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that prevents it so i'm
 
03:07:04.950 --> 03:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
just wondering
 
03:07:07.110 --> 03:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
maybe what the need is to add that
 
03:07:09.910 --> 03:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
language in if unless it it's sort of to
 
03:07:12.469 --> 03:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
remove some prevention that that climate
 
03:07:14.150 --> 03:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
change can't be talked about it i know
 
03:07:16.229 --> 03:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
when i when i work on uh i've worked on
 
03:07:18.710 --> 03:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
a state plan in oklahoma we absolutely
 
03:07:20.469 --> 03:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
had the freedom to include it if we
 
03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to or not include that if we
 
03:07:24.229 --> 03:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
didn't want to so i'm just kind of
 
03:07:25.510 --> 03:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if you knew anything about the
 
03:07:28.229 --> 03:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
state plan in that regard right so in
 
03:07:30.150 --> 03:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
terms of the
 
03:07:33.269 --> 03:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
the term the state soil uh conservation
 
03:07:36.229 --> 03:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
plan this statute act is effectively
 
03:07:37.750 --> 03:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
that plan
 
03:07:40.070 --> 03:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
so uh and it was the this is the plan
 
03:07:42.150 --> 03:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
that was ordered that the federal
 
03:07:43.990 --> 03:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
government ordered states to have back
 
03:07:46.150 --> 03:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
in the 1930s and
 
03:07:48.870 --> 03:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh the progression the sort of
 
03:07:50.790 --> 03:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
gradual progression of
 
03:07:52.710 --> 03:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
minor changes to the plan
 
03:07:55.030 --> 03:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh has um
 
03:07:57.910 --> 03:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
has gone on since then uh and i as i
 
03:08:00.070 --> 03:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier the last significant
 
03:08:02.150 --> 03:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
change was back in the 1980s
 
03:08:03.429 --> 03:08:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
03:08:05.429 --> 03:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:08:07.670 --> 03:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
the reason so there's nothing in this in
 
03:08:09.910 --> 03:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
this statute that says anything about
 
03:08:12.150 --> 03:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
climate change whatsoever
 
03:08:15.110 --> 03:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh and so and there's no sort of state
 
03:08:18.229 --> 03:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
prohibition on saying anything about it
 
03:08:18.239 --> 03:08:19.110 align:start position:0%
prohibition on saying anything about it
it's

03:08:19.110 --> 03:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:08:22.150 --> 03:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
the the main thrust here is that
 
03:08:25.429 --> 03:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of the grants that
 
03:08:26.950 --> 03:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
are now
 
03:08:29.189 --> 03:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
likely to become available
 
03:08:31.429 --> 03:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh in response to current world
 
03:08:31.439 --> 03:08:33.429 align:start position:0%
uh in response to current world
conditions

03:08:33.429 --> 03:08:33.439 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
03:08:37.750 --> 03:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
may make reference to climate change and
 
03:08:40.610 --> 03:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
the having that as a specific
 
03:08:40.620 --> 03:08:42.150 align:start position:0%
the having that as a specific
[Music]

03:08:42.150 --> 03:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:08:45.110 --> 03:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
goal of our state soil conservation plan
 
03:08:47.990 --> 03:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
is something that uh would strengthen
 
03:08:49.990 --> 03:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
any grant that we that someone from a
 
03:08:52.710 --> 03:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
conservation district would write
 
03:08:52.720 --> 03:08:53.510 align:start position:0%
conservation district would write
and

03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:08:55.349 --> 03:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
thereby increase the the chances of
 
03:08:56.469 --> 03:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
getting it
 
03:08:58.070 --> 03:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
03:08:59.910 --> 03:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i'll remind the
 
03:09:01.750 --> 03:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative that
 
03:09:03.269 --> 03:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
the all questions should be directed
 
03:09:04.710 --> 03:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
through the chair rather than having a
 
03:09:04.720 --> 03:09:06.229 align:start position:0%
through the chair rather than having a
conversation

03:09:06.229 --> 03:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
03:09:08.950 --> 03:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:11.110 --> 03:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
all right do we have any other questions
 
03:09:13.030 --> 03:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
03:09:15.910 --> 03:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative stapleton
 
03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh mr chair thank you for
 
03:09:20.150 --> 03:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
i'm having difficulty with uh page 2
 
03:09:26.710 --> 03:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
line 22
 
03:09:28.790 --> 03:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
roman two
 
03:09:28.800 --> 03:09:29.910 align:start position:0%
roman two
um

03:09:29.910 --> 03:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:32.630 --> 03:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
the mitigation um
 
03:09:35.110 --> 03:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
of course i've not heard of this before
 
03:09:38.630 --> 03:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
um or seen this kind of thing before but
 
03:09:41.670 --> 03:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
are we really focused on the sources or
 
03:09:43.830 --> 03:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
the effects
 
03:09:46.309 --> 03:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
of climate change
 
03:09:49.750 --> 03:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
and and preventing um damage or harm
 
03:09:51.030 --> 03:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
from those
 
03:09:54.229 --> 03:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
effects rather than perhaps trying to
 
03:09:57.990 --> 03:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
change climate and reverse climate
 
03:09:59.349 --> 03:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to give you an example
 
03:10:01.349 --> 03:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
where i'm asking this
 
03:10:03.110 --> 03:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
we've noticed in the past couple of
 
03:10:03.120 --> 03:10:04.229 align:start position:0%
we've noticed in the past couple of
years

03:10:04.229 --> 03:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:10:06.870 --> 03:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
torrential rains
 
03:10:09.269 --> 03:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
much heavier than we typically
 
03:10:12.630 --> 03:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
have been used to in decades past
 
03:10:14.630 --> 03:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they're washing out
 
03:10:16.150 --> 03:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
roads so
 
03:10:16.160 --> 03:10:17.189 align:start position:0%
roads so
to

03:10:17.189 --> 03:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
mitigate the effect of that
 
03:10:23.189 --> 03:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
towns and cities are increasing the size
 
03:10:25.510 --> 03:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
and the expense and the expanse of rip
 
03:10:25.520 --> 03:10:26.950 align:start position:0%
and the expense and the expanse of rip
rap

03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
rap
 
03:10:31.030 --> 03:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
so that it prevents the war road warship
 
03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:32.150 align:start position:0%
so that it prevents the war road warship
um

03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:34.710 --> 03:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
and and the the other part of this that
 
03:10:36.790 --> 03:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
confuses me is
 
03:10:39.990 --> 03:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
the words enhance the sinks
 
03:10:42.550 --> 03:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
of greenhouse gases
 
03:10:45.030 --> 03:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
i i'm not in that industry uh are
 
03:10:47.429 --> 03:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
familiar with that can you explain that
 
03:10:49.910 --> 03:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases
 
03:10:53.429 --> 03:10:53.439 align:start position:0%
what you're driving at it is that for
 
03:10:58.309 --> 03:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:59.670 --> 03:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
03:11:01.990 --> 03:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
i guess who i would like to answer it oh
 
03:11:04.469 --> 03:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
i'm fine with taking it so in the in the
 
03:11:04.479 --> 03:11:06.309 align:start position:0%
i'm fine with taking it so in the in the
context

03:11:06.309 --> 03:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
context
 
03:11:06.319 --> 03:11:07.429 align:start position:0%
context
of

03:11:07.429 --> 03:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:11:09.110 --> 03:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
of agriculture
 
03:11:11.349 --> 03:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
and that's that that's where that's my
 
03:11:13.670 --> 03:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
foundation here uh
 
03:11:16.630 --> 03:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
what you described relative to a town
 
03:11:18.830 --> 03:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
in the agricultural sense would be an
 
03:11:21.189 --> 03:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
adaptation it's not that we're not
 
03:11:22.710 --> 03:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:11:26.309 --> 03:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
modify or do things that uh
 
03:11:26.319 --> 03:11:29.349 align:start position:0%
modify or do things that uh
reduce

03:11:29.349 --> 03:11:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:31.189 --> 03:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
the conditions that are making these
 
03:11:33.110 --> 03:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events happen reducing
 
03:11:34.950 --> 03:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases now sometimes
 
03:11:37.189 --> 03:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
adaptation practices
 
03:11:37.199 --> 03:11:38.309 align:start position:0%
adaptation practices
are

03:11:38.309 --> 03:11:38.319 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
this are similar or the same as
 
03:11:42.309 --> 03:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
mitigation practices but i'll give you
 
03:11:44.070 --> 03:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
an example of mitigation practice and
 
03:11:45.750 --> 03:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's why i said this
 
03:11:48.309 --> 03:11:48.319 align:start position:0%
is probably limited to only our largest
 
03:11:50.870 --> 03:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
farms because right now there is uh
 
03:11:53.910 --> 03:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
there are existing markets for carbon
 
03:11:56.550 --> 03:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
sequestration in ag soils also in forest
 
03:11:59.830 --> 03:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
soils and so what when an industry say
 
03:12:01.349 --> 03:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
cargill says
 
03:12:03.030 --> 03:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay farmers to sequester
 
03:12:04.469 --> 03:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
carbon and the farmers are going to
 
03:12:06.950 --> 03:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
adopt no-till practices or put cover
 
03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
crops on and then they're going to get
 
03:12:11.590 --> 03:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know 15 to 20 per acre for the
 
03:12:13.269 --> 03:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
carbon that they sequester after it's
 
03:12:15.269 --> 03:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
you know measured and quantified
 
03:12:18.309 --> 03:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
the that's what the mitigation uh is
 
03:12:20.550 --> 03:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
addressing and to reduce the sources or
 
03:12:22.469 --> 03:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
enhance the sinks and greenhouse gases
 
03:12:24.229 --> 03:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
you know if you re if you every time you
 
03:12:25.910 --> 03:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
till the soil you're releasing carbon
 
03:12:27.349 --> 03:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
into the atmosphere
 
03:12:29.429 --> 03:12:29.439 align:start position:0%
so the more that you can keep that
 
03:12:31.349 --> 03:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
carbon in the soil
 
03:12:33.429 --> 03:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
that is a mitigating effect and there
 
03:12:34.950 --> 03:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
are other things like i mentioned
 
03:12:37.910 --> 03:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
digesters for our larger dairy farms may
 
03:12:40.070 --> 03:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
prove to be something that will
 
03:12:40.080 --> 03:12:41.269 align:start position:0%
prove to be something that will
provide

03:12:41.269 --> 03:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:12:44.389 --> 03:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
power revenue power revenue for the farm
 
03:12:47.349 --> 03:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
as well as perhaps a mitigating carbon
 
03:12:50.150 --> 03:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh payment as well um
 
03:12:51.110 --> 03:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
but again
 
03:12:53.189 --> 03:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
given the smallness of our agriculture
 
03:12:56.950 --> 03:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
in general mitigation is is not uh
 
03:12:59.429 --> 03:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh probably the the first and foremost
 
03:13:01.110 --> 03:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
thing it's really those adaptive things
 
03:13:02.710 --> 03:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
representative like you mentioned about
 
03:13:04.309 --> 03:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
what the town's doing to deal with you
 
03:13:06.790 --> 03:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
know 100 year storms every 20 years or
 
03:13:08.389 --> 03:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
whatever the frequency is we're having
 
03:13:09.990 --> 03:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
them now
 
03:13:11.189 --> 03:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
is that does that answer your question
 
03:13:11.199 --> 03:13:12.790 align:start position:0%
is that does that answer your question
sir

03:13:12.790 --> 03:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
sir
 
03:13:15.429 --> 03:13:15.439 align:start position:0%
it begins to draw my attention to where
 
03:13:17.349 --> 03:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
i have to go to learn a little bit more
 
03:13:19.750 --> 03:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
about this these are strange terms but
 
03:13:21.990 --> 03:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
that that is helpful thank you for the
 
03:13:23.670 --> 03:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
answer you're welcome thank you for the
 
03:13:23.680 --> 03:13:26.149 align:start position:0%
answer you're welcome thank you for the
question

03:13:26.149 --> 03:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:13:28.389 --> 03:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions
 
03:13:30.149 --> 03:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
representative control
 
03:13:32.070 --> 03:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
03:13:33.990 --> 03:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:13:38.830 --> 03:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
um i remember this bill from last term
 
03:13:42.070 --> 03:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
and we discussed a lot about climate
 
03:13:44.309 --> 03:13:44.319 align:start position:0%
change and then at the time i don't
 
03:13:46.070 --> 03:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
believe the term technology
 
03:13:48.229 --> 03:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
environmental change was in there
 
03:13:50.469 --> 03:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
and we had suggested taking climate
 
03:13:52.149 --> 03:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
change and putting in environmental
 
03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
change because and i'm just trying to
 
03:13:56.550 --> 03:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
wonder why we have both now in there i
 
03:13:59.030 --> 03:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
think you said because of grants but i
 
03:14:04.149 --> 03:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:07.189 --> 03:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative bixby i think
 
03:14:08.870 --> 03:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:14:08.880 --> 03:14:10.710 align:start position:0%
so uh
the

03:14:10.710 --> 03:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:14:10.720 --> 03:14:11.830 align:start position:0%
the
uh

03:14:11.830 --> 03:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:14:13.670 --> 03:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discussion about this
 
03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
in terms and and
 
03:14:15.359 --> 03:14:16.710 align:start position:0%
in terms and and
essentially

03:14:16.710 --> 03:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:14:19.429 --> 03:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
that phrasing of um
 
03:14:21.750 --> 03:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
the uh client
 
03:14:23.750 --> 03:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
the climate ending uh climate and
 
03:14:26.389 --> 03:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
environmental change was a
 
03:14:26.399 --> 03:14:28.469 align:start position:0%
environmental change was a
uh

03:14:28.469 --> 03:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:14:31.189 --> 03:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
language that i i believe that that
 
03:14:32.870 --> 03:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
might have been what was negotiated
 
03:14:32.880 --> 03:14:34.149 align:start position:0%
might have been what was negotiated
between

03:14:34.149 --> 03:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:14:35.510 --> 03:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh chairman
 
03:14:39.349 --> 03:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
pearl and uh roger noonan uh
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
03:14:43.510 --> 03:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
sort of um iron out some differences in
 
03:14:46.950 --> 03:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
language preference uh the
 
03:14:49.349 --> 03:14:49.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of um
 
03:14:51.189 --> 03:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
the importance of keeping the climate
 
03:14:52.870 --> 03:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
there is
 
03:14:55.750 --> 03:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
definitely that that will strengthen uh
 
03:14:55.760 --> 03:14:56.710 align:start position:0%
definitely that that will strengthen uh
the

03:14:56.710 --> 03:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:14:56.720 --> 03:14:57.670 align:start position:0%
the
um

03:14:57.670 --> 03:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:59.189 --> 03:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
the ability for
 
03:15:02.830 --> 03:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
districts to get grants uh the
 
03:15:05.750 --> 03:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
um having the environmental change in
 
03:15:07.030 --> 03:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
there as well
 
03:15:10.229 --> 03:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
is an indication that uh soil health
 
03:15:10.239 --> 03:15:12.309 align:start position:0%
is an indication that uh soil health
doesn't

03:15:12.309 --> 03:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
03:15:13.830 --> 03:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
there are other environmental
 
03:15:15.429 --> 03:15:15.439 align:start position:0%
environmental changes that may be
 
03:15:15.439 --> 03:15:16.550 align:start position:0%
environmental changes that may be
happening

03:15:16.550 --> 03:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
happening
 
03:15:19.110 --> 03:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
that are not strictly climate related
 
03:15:21.590 --> 03:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
that soil health would also help
 
03:15:22.950 --> 03:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
offset or
 
03:15:24.149 --> 03:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
re or
 
03:15:25.429 --> 03:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
adapt to
 
03:15:27.590 --> 03:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman if i could just sort of
 
03:15:29.830 --> 03:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
tag on to that uh just a couple of
 
03:15:32.469 --> 03:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
examples you know invasive insects
 
03:15:34.389 --> 03:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh and those are coming in from changing
 
03:15:36.070 --> 03:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
weather patterns they're they come in on
 
03:15:37.830 --> 03:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
shipping crates uh you know so we're
 
03:15:40.070 --> 03:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
getting uh invasive species all kinds
 
03:15:43.349 --> 03:15:43.359 align:start position:0%
insects plants there's a there's a wide
 
03:15:46.149 --> 03:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
range of new challenges uh that we're
 
03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:52.149 --> 03:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative murray has
 
03:15:54.469 --> 03:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
her hand up did i recognize her for a
 
03:15:54.479 --> 03:15:55.590 align:start position:0%
her hand up did i recognize her for a
question

03:15:55.590 --> 03:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:15:57.110 --> 03:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for
 
03:15:59.269 --> 03:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
recognizing my question uh mr noonan i
 
03:16:00.790 --> 03:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
did have a question
 
03:16:03.269 --> 03:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
uh i guess regarding terminology as well
 
03:16:04.870 --> 03:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
i was thinking about the terminology
 
03:16:06.710 --> 03:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
that i've heard called regenerative
 
03:16:09.670 --> 03:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
soils is that similar to anything we're
 
03:16:11.429 --> 03:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
talking about i'm just trying to come up
 
03:16:13.590 --> 03:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
to speed myself
 
03:16:15.910 --> 03:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
so regenerative is um
 
03:16:18.389 --> 03:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
it's the new sustainable uh a few years
 
03:16:21.189 --> 03:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
ago sustainable was the the term du jour
 
03:16:24.229 --> 03:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh for all things that were uh
 
03:16:24.239 --> 03:16:25.670 align:start position:0%
uh for all things that were uh
not

03:16:25.670 --> 03:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:16:27.510 --> 03:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
what we currently do and now it's
 
03:16:29.429 --> 03:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
regenerative so regenerative includes
 
03:16:30.550 --> 03:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
things like
 
03:16:33.189 --> 03:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
no-till with gmo crops and and
 
03:16:35.030 --> 03:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know spraying glyphosate because
 
03:16:36.950 --> 03:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
you're not tilling the soil so therefore
 
03:16:38.389 --> 03:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
that's for general organic farming like
 
03:16:39.830 --> 03:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
i practice is regenerative because we
 
03:16:41.670 --> 03:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
use cover crops and incorporate green
 
03:16:44.229 --> 03:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
manures so it's a it's a broad catch-all
 
03:16:45.670 --> 03:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
term it has
 
03:16:45.680 --> 03:16:46.550 align:start position:0%
term it has
uh

03:16:46.550 --> 03:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:16:49.030 --> 03:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
varying definitions i think uh that
 
03:16:51.189 --> 03:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
whatever company monsanto is part of now
 
03:16:54.950 --> 03:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
since uh has a has a regenerative ag
 
03:16:57.750 --> 03:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
terminology right down to you know you
 
03:17:00.870 --> 03:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
can find it on most organic
 
03:17:03.670 --> 03:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
companies websites so
 
03:17:05.269 --> 03:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
but it generally refers to those same
 
03:17:06.630 --> 03:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
things you're going to improve your soil
 
03:17:08.149 --> 03:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
health you're going to store carbon in
 
03:17:10.309 --> 03:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
the soil you're going to reduce tillage
 
03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
those those are sort of foundational
 
03:17:14.229 --> 03:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
practices they're foundational practices
 
03:17:16.790 --> 03:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
to the soil conservation movement uh
 
03:17:20.550 --> 03:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
going back to the to the 1940s
 
03:17:21.910 --> 03:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:17:23.429 --> 03:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:17:25.590 --> 03:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
all right any further questions i don't
 
03:17:28.630 --> 03:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
see any more hands any representation
 
03:17:28.640 --> 03:17:29.590 align:start position:0%
see any more hands any representation
yes

03:17:29.590 --> 03:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:17:31.590 --> 03:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
we'll give you one more
 
03:17:31.600 --> 03:17:32.630 align:start position:0%
we'll give you one more
sorry

03:17:32.630 --> 03:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:17:34.950 --> 03:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
so sorry i'm learning all this right now
 
03:17:37.030 --> 03:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
um i did have a question hopefully you
 
03:17:38.550 --> 03:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
can hear me now or if not i'll jump up
 
03:17:38.560 --> 03:17:39.510 align:start position:0%
can hear me now or if not i'll jump up
but

03:17:39.510 --> 03:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:17:41.750 --> 03:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
the question i did have is on page 4
 
03:17:43.590 --> 03:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
line 22 just
 
03:17:46.710 --> 03:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
in sentence for landowners
 
03:17:48.149 --> 03:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
can you uh
 
03:17:50.309 --> 03:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
can you speak to what what's inferred on
 
03:17:50.319 --> 03:17:52.469 align:start position:0%
can you speak to what what's inferred on
incentives

03:17:52.469 --> 03:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
incentives
 
03:17:54.309 --> 03:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
sure so i'll give you i'll give you a
 
03:17:57.030 --> 03:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
personal example a couple of years ago
 
03:17:58.630 --> 03:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
somebody from the conservation district
 
03:18:00.070 --> 03:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
pulled up with a pickup truck and handed
 
03:18:02.550 --> 03:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
me four bags of cover crop seed uh you
 
03:18:04.229 --> 03:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
know that's an incentive for me to put
 
03:18:07.030 --> 03:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
cover crops in my ground um
 
03:18:10.389 --> 03:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh their other incentives could be
 
03:18:11.830 --> 03:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
i mean that's
 
03:18:13.510 --> 03:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
i think that's a prime example and
 
03:18:15.189 --> 03:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
really what i think we're trying to do
 
03:18:15.199 --> 03:18:16.149 align:start position:0%
really what i think we're trying to do
here

03:18:16.149 --> 03:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:18:18.389 --> 03:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
you know we've got a federal agency nrcs
 
03:18:19.910 --> 03:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
that does a great job working with
 
03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
farmers helping them put these practices
 
03:18:23.030 --> 03:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
on the ground but
 
03:18:25.189 --> 03:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
if any of you folks have worked with
 
03:18:27.189 --> 03:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
them you know they're for a smaller farm
 
03:18:29.349 --> 03:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
they can kind of have a high bar of
 
03:18:31.750 --> 03:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
participation there's paperwork and
 
03:18:33.110 --> 03:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that a small farmer
 
03:18:34.389 --> 03:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
especially one that may be farming
 
03:18:36.870 --> 03:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
part-time uh may find
 
03:18:38.469 --> 03:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
that the juice isn't worth the squeeze
 
03:18:39.670 --> 03:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
so the more we can empower our
 
03:18:41.349 --> 03:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
conservation districts
 
03:18:43.910 --> 03:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh just to get those funds from wherever
 
03:18:45.990 --> 03:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
to do this work i think the the more
 
03:18:49.189 --> 03:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have small farmers
 
03:18:51.670 --> 03:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
be able to adopt these practices and try
 
03:18:53.830 --> 03:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
them out and see if there is a economic
 
03:18:55.590 --> 03:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
return and
 
03:18:56.870 --> 03:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
and i'll tell you an
 
03:18:59.030 --> 03:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
economic return would be i'll tell you
 
03:19:00.950 --> 03:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
last year we had a drought but you know
 
03:19:02.550 --> 03:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
we we had a pretty we had a pretty good
 
03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
crop because we've got high organic
 
03:19:06.389 --> 03:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
matter we're able to hold our soil we're
 
03:19:08.630 --> 03:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
using the drip irrigation we're doing
 
03:19:10.790 --> 03:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
those things um
 
03:19:13.510 --> 03:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
that help us adapt uh to the
 
03:19:15.990 --> 03:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
increasingly unpredictable
 
03:19:17.670 --> 03:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
weather and i know those of us that
