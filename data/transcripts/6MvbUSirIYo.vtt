00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
we don't want to get too far behind
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
today so why don't we go ahead and get
 
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
going I apologize we don't have full
 
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
attendance for you Senator but we'll at
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
least get started I see these bills
 
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
aren't nearly as exciting as yesterday's
 
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.150 align:start position:0%
aren't nearly as exciting as yesterday's
bills

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
title is throwing us off because we have
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
no idea what it means so that's the time
 
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
being 9 35 I will now open the public
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill 190 and recognize
 
00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:42.419 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor Senator Tim Lang thank
 
00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
you for joining us thank you very much
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair it feels like just
 
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday I was here
 
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.529 align:start position:0%
yesterday I was here
um

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
so uh Advanced deposit wagering it's
 
00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
horse racing in simple terms it's horse
 
00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:55.129 align:start position:0%
horse racing in simple terms it's horse
racing

00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
racing
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
um there was some confusion in the
 
00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
lottery so this bill is brought at the
 
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
behest of the New Hampshire lottery as
 
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
well as the New Hampshire Attorney
 
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
General's office there was some
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
confusion as to whether or not uh say
 
00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:08.759 align:start position:0%
when the Kentucky Derby is running and
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
you pick up the phone and you call and
 
00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
place a bet on a horse whether that was
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
legal or not
 
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
um and it's it there's a there's a
 
00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
provision it's called we'll see if I can
 
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
find there's a federal provision that
 
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
allows it's the interstate horse racing
 
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
Act of 17 of 1978 which legalizes at a
 
00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
federal level that Interstate action but
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
at the state level we have a little bit
 
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
weird rules with charitable gaming
 
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
online gaming and those kind of things
 
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
and so the question was whether or not
 
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
it was legal in New Hampshire and so
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
when the lottery went to
 
00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
um the Attorney General's office and
 
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
asked for a legal opinion basically the
 
00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
Attorney General General said well we're
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
not sure and they weren't sure whether
 
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
it was legal or not so they asked us to
 
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
submit a bill to make it clear that
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
we're in compliance with the interstate
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
horse racing gaming act and it is a
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
legal function within the state of New
 
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's the short version of
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
the bill there are some other things in
 
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
here that just provide consumer
 
00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
protections bonding for the gaming
 
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
operators as well as things like cyber
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
security requirements and that kind of
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
stuff for these online for these uh
 
00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
horse racing outfits that are going to
 
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
be working in New Hampshire
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
there are a lot smarter people behind me
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
that probably can answer detailed
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
questions but if you have questions
 
00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
about the words on the bill I can
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
is this a phone app what are we talking
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
about so it's it's a it's a combination
 
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
of both again like a lot of horse racing
 
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
is done literally by phone you know call
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
into you know Churchill Downs and place
 
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
your bet for the Kentucky Derby right
 
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
and so you can have an account put in
 
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
your account make and make the BET and
 
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
the question was again whether that was
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
legal it also involves a gaming app so
 
00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:52.019 align:start position:0%
you can twin spiers or Churchill Downs
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh their app
 
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
um it also legalizes that as an
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
interstate action that goes on as well
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
so that's what that Interstate horse
 
00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
racing Act of 1978 allows for interstate
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
commerce like including horse racing so
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
this just clarifies that New Hampshire
 
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
says yeah it's legal in New Hampshire
 
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
too and not in violation of one of our
 
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator other would you take
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
questions sure absolutely okay uh other
 
00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:22.019 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
uh representative again
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.750 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
is there a limit on um
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
how large these deposits are
 
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
so again I I defer to Senator Bragdon
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
over here the former Senate President
 
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
who's going to be testifying who has a
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
lot more detail about the inner
 
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
operations of how things like Churchill
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
Downs works all right thank you
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
yes representative Orson thank you madam
 
00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:52.970 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
so

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
Advance deposit account wagering so
 
00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
somebody has an account on file like an
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
e-account and so they can place bets at
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
any time but even during the race
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
again I'd defer that to Mr Bragdon I'm
 
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
not an expert in horse racing by any
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
stretch of the imagination again I
 
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
brought this because of lotteries
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
statement the fact that it was
 
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
questionable whether or not it was legal
 
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
or not and so we wanted to make it
 
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
absolutely clear in statue that it was a
 
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
legal activity and we were in compliance
 
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
with the interstate horse racing Act of
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
1978. okay very good let's follow up
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
and so I guess it's just the word event
 
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
so all the advanced means is the money's
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
on file somewhere right again usually
 
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
it's again you open an account you may
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
deposit some money in and then you use
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
that money for your betting and then you
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
either renew it with more money if you
 
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
lose and if you don't lose then you get
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
to continue to use the money or withdraw
 
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
it for your bank account very good thank
 
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.110 align:start position:0%
it for your bank account very good thank
you

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh just because of that does this bill
 
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
go to Commerce at all or no this is just
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
this bill it did not in the in the house
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
in the Senate okay thank you
 
00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
uh representative thank you madam chair
 
00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:02.839 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking my question
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
I missed the very beginning and you
 
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
might have just touched on it you filed
 
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
this legislation at at whose request
 
00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
sorry both the New Hampshire lottery as
 
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
well as the Attorney General's office
 
00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:17.579 align:start position:0%
there was a question on legality and we
 
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:21.620 align:start position:0%
wanted to clear clarify the legality
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
a question on the legality can you
 
00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:28.019 align:start position:0%
expand on that okay sure so New
 
00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are even our horse racing um
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
language is pretty Antiquated
 
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
um and so it didn't anticipate whether
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
you could pick up the phone and call or
 
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
whether you could
 
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
um place a bet online uh using an app
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
um it didn't clarify that we have brick
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
and mortar type locations in New
 
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think there's two or three
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
that allow for simulcast and horse
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
betting races at Brick and Mortar but
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
there was nothing to find so we
 
00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:53.579 align:start position:0%
legalized horse betting uh betting on
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
horse races but we didn't have a an
 
00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
off-site mechanism for it and yet the
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
federal government did allow for that
 
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
follow okay and this is probably better
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
for legal counsel for lottery but you
 
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
had mentioned the app TwinSpires that's
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
one of the apps I know about there's
 
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
several of them and you can ask again
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert by any stretch I file
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
this bill again at the request of
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
Lottery and are you aware that that app
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
has been in use in the state of New
 
00:13:22.079 --> 00:13:22.970 align:start position:0%
has been in use in the state of New
Hampshire

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
I know maybe illegally for decades again
 
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
I know that and that's why the question
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
came up was that the app was in use and
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
the question came forward whether or not
 
00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:34.519 align:start position:0%
it was legal or not and there was an
 
00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:37.139 align:start position:0%
inconclusive uh determination and so
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make it a conclusive
 
00:13:38.579 --> 00:13:44.210 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make it a conclusive
determination

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much senator okay the
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
chair will now recognize I'm sorry madam
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
chair one more thing please so you're
 
00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
um so uh Senator Bragdon is going to be
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
giving you some ideas for change that
 
00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
have been vetted through Lottery and I
 
00:13:59.210 --> 00:13:59.220 align:start position:0%
know that and if the committee were to
 
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
adopt these changes the Senate ways it
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
means committee would concur with those
 
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
adoptions of changes okay it's clarified
 
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
language thank you for the heads up on
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
that uh we'll recognize Sean Thomas from
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
express bet
 
00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much for this
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity my name is Sean Thomas I'm
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
with Demers and praisal here in Concord
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
and here today representing express bit
 
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
in support of Senate Bill 190. let me
 
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
first tell you quickly about express bet
 
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
and then why we support this bill
 
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
express bet is an ADW or Advanced
 
00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
deposit wagering or online horse
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
wagering provider and has been since
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
2002 it offers online horse betting so
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
you can make your picks and place your
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
bets at over 400 race tracks whether on
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
your computer your phone or other
 
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
electronic device and express bet is
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
completely dedicated to horse racing
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
that's all they do online horse betting
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's really a commitment they are
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
heavily invested in the technology and
 
00:15:23.329 --> 00:15:23.339 align:start position:0%
in providing the industry's safest most
 
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
secure and most reliable experience and
 
00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
that's really what this bill is all
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
about and why we ask for your support I
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
think the bill probably reads a little
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
more complicated than it actually is
 
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
online horse betting already takes place
 
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire this wouldn't be an
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
expansion of gambling the question when
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
it comes to Senate Bill 190 is whether
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
the industry should continue unregulated
 
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
or whether it should be regulated and
 
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
licensed through lottery so I know it
 
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
seems unusual that we would support
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
regulation but we really view it as a
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
good thing one it clarifies the law you
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
heard there are you know there's some
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
there's some question there's a gray
 
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
area call it we currently operate under
 
00:16:04.569 --> 00:16:04.579 align:start position:0%
federal law and pursuant to a
 
00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
multi-jurisdictional license
 
00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:08.389 align:start position:0%
multi-jurisdictional license
um

00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire doesn't specifically
 
00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:12.779 align:start position:0%
address that federal law and that's
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
really the gray area but we have
 
00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
so that's so it clarifies the law that's
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
a good thing and two it really comes
 
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
down to and has to do a lot with
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
consumer protection
 
00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
um and so I I guess what I'll say about
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
that is so expressbed is already
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
committed to providing a secure legal
 
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
experience but that should be guaranteed
 
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
to all New Hampshire residents whether
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
through express bet or another provider
 
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
and how this compares to other states so
 
00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
we currently operate in 38 States in 22
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
we have a license and so it would be
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
great to add New Hampshire as number 23.
 
00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:49.139 align:start position:0%
also a side note about the bill so this
 
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
is generally supported by industry
 
00:16:53.569 --> 00:16:53.579 align:start position:0%
obviously by Lottery is that the request
 
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
of Lottery it came out of Senate Ways
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
and Means with unanimous ought to pass
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation recommendation past the
 
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
Senate on a Voice vote there was no
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
opposition in the Senate and I'm still
 
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
not aware of any opposition at this
 
00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.270 align:start position:0%
not aware of any opposition at this
point

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
um so again thank you very much for this
 
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to testify and I also
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
provided or passed up written testimony
 
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
with more information about express bet
 
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
and that's from Gene chabreira Express
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
vice president of Regulatory Affairs so
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
would you be open to questions from the
 
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959 align:start position:0%
committee sure would awesome
 
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:29.660 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative Giuseppe yeah just a
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
quick question have you
 
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
and do you at present have you been
 
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
taken online bets on horse racing since
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
2002. I believe that's correct yes okay
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
a super question how do you ensure
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
someone's over 18 how do you verify that
 
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
um so express bet uses a third party to
 
00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
verify identity age residence
 
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
and that's really robust technology so
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
that that's a very important piece of
 
00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:06.620 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
you know when the user comes when the
 
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.070 align:start position:0%
you know when the user comes when the
user

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
user
 
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
someone comes onto the app wants to use
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
the system that is the very first thing
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
that takes place we need to verify their
 
00:18:18.409 --> 00:18:18.419 align:start position:0%
identity make sure they are who they say
 
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
Peter Bragdon who is representing
 
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:01.860 align:start position:0%

Downs and a thing you may not know about
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
me is I for a number of years taught
 
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
high school math and one thing I learned
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
was you never hand out what you want to
 
00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:18.059 align:start position:0%
deal with uh before you want to deal
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
with it because then people spend all
 
00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:21.299 align:start position:0%
their time looking at it so um I with
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
great trepidation handout my my
 
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
suggestions before I actually say
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
anything but I'll get to that in a
 
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
moment so uh here today representing
 
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:30.900 align:start position:0%

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
today I was home with the Kentucky Derby
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
and live video from all major race
 
00:20:18.409 --> 00:20:18.419 align:start position:0%
courses in the United States and abroad
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
including tracks from the United Kingdom
 
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
Sweden Japan New Zealand Australia and
 
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
South Africa
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh here this morning in support of
 
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 190 with some suggested
 
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
changes to consider I would say that we
 
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
feel sb190 would give certainty and
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
predictability to the state's regulation
 
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
Advance deposit wagering as was
 
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there is some gray
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
area I guess it seems as to whether it's
 
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
legal or not
 
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
um or at least whether it's covered by
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
federal law or state law and we feel
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
it's best to get that resolved we do
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
operate in more than 30 States and it
 
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
would certainly be good to have the
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure clarified we do ask
 
00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
the committee consider a few changes and
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
I didn't keep a copy of that for myself
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
but I believe the first one is to take
 
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
out the um maybe could I uh get a copy
 
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
oh yeah now I remember so uh the first
 
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
change is a relatively simple removing
 
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
uh some words so at the end of the last
 
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:28.220 align:start position:0%
sentence of a proposed new paragraph uh
 
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
22-c3 uh remove the everything after the
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
word chapter so on line 21 uh would
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
enter the word chapter and I put the
 
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
explanation there basically the goal of
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
this whole paragraph is to allow
 
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
evidence of Surety bonds used in other
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions to be allowed to be
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
submitted in New Hampshire as well one
 
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
of the goals is to make it so that uh
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
all the various vendors of ADW Services
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
aren't doing different things in every
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
single state so there's pretty much
 
00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
everybody does it the same way uh except
 
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
this language about payments due to the
 
00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539 align:start position:0%
account holders is not something that I
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
believe appears in other states so it
 
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
would make it a little more difficult we
 
00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
do believe however that the account
 
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
holders are still protected because if
 
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:12.299 align:start position:0%
you look at the bill on line 28 just a
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
little bit further down from that
 
00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.110 align:start position:0%
little bit further down from that
um

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission will require a
 
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
plan of operation to be submitted that
 
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
has to be approved by the Lottery
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
Commission and line 28 says that that
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
plan of operation has to include
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
procedures to protect the security of
 
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
account holders accounts and their
 
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
information so we believe it's covered
 
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
by that and I will say that these have
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
all been run uh changed Auburn run by
 
00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:36.059 align:start position:0%
Lottery who has approved them in Senator
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
Lang also indicated he would be
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
acceptable with them as well the second
 
00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:42.299 align:start position:0%
suggests the change is to add some
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
language to uh paragraph F on page two
 
00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.610 align:start position:0%
language to uh paragraph F on page two
line

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
four and that deals with a financial
 
00:22:51.409 --> 00:22:51.419 align:start position:0%
audit and as I mentioned before
 
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
Churchill Downs is a publicly traded
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
Corporation TwinSpires as a division uh
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
so there's a number of financial audits
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
that we already go through and submit to
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
the Securities and Exchange Commission
 
00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:03.539 align:start position:0%
so we asked there was some gray area as
 
00:23:06.169 --> 00:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
to whether that might be considered uh
 
00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
suitable for f and we thought it'd be
 
00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:09.539 align:start position:0%
better if it was clearly spelled out
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
that it would and again lotteries agreed
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
to that and then last but not least add
 
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
the words for cause uh onto that
 
00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
paragraph five which appears on line
 
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
nine of page two the
 
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
um this involves the lottery revoking
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
the plan of operation so we just
 
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
requested that it before cause not that
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
we have any dispute with the Lottery
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
Commission or the folks at Lottery now
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
they've been uh very gracious and
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
flexible so don't anticipate a problem
 
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
but I'll say the lawyers pointed that
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
out so I'm not a lawyer so
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
um so those are the changes we would
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
suggest and
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
um there may be others that other
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
vendors have suggested but uh I'll speak
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
for these and I'm happy to answer any
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
questions that uh you only oh I'm sorry
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
one other thing I should mention is I
 
00:23:59.450 --> 00:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
almost forgot this the line 12 on page
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
two uh and then I will say Lottery has
 
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
agreed with the changes I handed out to
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
you uh a lot I've not uh Lottery has not
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
agreed that I know I'm going to be
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
bringing this up have not agreed with
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
anything on that I'm about to say line
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
12 indicates that there'll be a a
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
revenue sharing if you will of 2.25
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
percent of everything all wagers
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
accepted uh we have a simulcast
 
00:24:24.649 --> 00:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
provision in state law that has a
 
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
similar structure but the rate there is
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
only one and a quarter percent so in our
 
00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
mind these are two different forms of
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
betting on horse races and maybe be
 
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
better if those two numbers were the
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
same but that's for you folks to to
 
00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.909 align:start position:0%
same but that's for you folks to to
consider

00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
and having said that I'll be happy to
 
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
though I will say people have uh made it
 
00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:45.419 align:start position:0%
out like I'm an expert on horse racing
 
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
and can answer any questions that come
 
00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
up I may not be able to
 
00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
yes questions from the community and
 
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Stringham nice to
 
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
see you uh you too yes well thank you
 
00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
for inviting me uh question on on your
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
amendment number two uh you say the
 
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
wagering provider is a subsidiary uh
 
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
would it be acceptable to say a wholly
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
owned subsidiary or rather than one
 
00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
that's only partially owned by the
 
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
parent company
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't know enough to comment on
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
that uh but uh I can understand why that
 
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
might be a reasonable request on your
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
part uh secondly publicly traded company
 
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
um you know there's some publicly traded
 
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
companies and not not yours in
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
particular but uh they're just bulletin
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
boards there's not not the same degree
 
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
of public uh auditing and rigor uh would
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
it be acceptable to say publicly traded
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
company on a major Stock Exchange
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
I would think so okay thank you
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative Doucette did I see your
 
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
I'm Jan thank you for taking my question
 
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.210 align:start position:0%
I'm Jan thank you for taking my question
um

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
I've got two questions one is how long
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
has TwinSpires been taking bets in New
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for the question
 
00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
represent I'm not sure how long I
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
understand it's been quite some time
 
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:02.940 align:start position:0%
although I will say Churchill uh
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
TwinSpires no longer operates in New
 
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as of last year as of last
 
00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
year yeah partly due to the issue of the
 
00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
gray area of regulatory and everything
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
else okay and during the time that they
 
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
were operating I know the the one
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
remaining license in the state to take
 
00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
simulcast betting is the brook now and
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
they're paying 1.25 on gross wages uh
 
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
what did twin spies pay to the state of
 
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire during that time uh thank
 
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
you for the question represent I'm not
 
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
100 sure but I'm going to guess the
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee yes
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative orrs
 
00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
taking my questions so does Churchill
 
00:26:48.409 --> 00:26:48.419 align:start position:0%
Downs plan to reimburse the state of New
 
00:26:48.419 --> 00:26:49.430 align:start position:0%
Downs plan to reimburse the state of New
Hampshire

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
for the operation at Randall legally for
 
00:26:54.289 --> 00:26:54.299 align:start position:0%
a number of years I think uh thank you
 
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
for the question representative I think
 
00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
the dispute is whether it ran illegally
 
00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:00.539 align:start position:0%
or not and as pointed out by Senator
 
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
Lang the Attorney General's office
 
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
requested this specific statute so
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
there's a regular structure in place
 
00:27:08.279 --> 00:27:08.870 align:start position:0%
there's a regular structure in place
um

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539 align:start position:0%
Advanced deposit wagering is permitted
 
00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:15.059 align:start position:0%
by the interstate horse racing act and
 
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in New Hampshire statute
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
that uh prohibits it so in in our view
 
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
it was something that was allowed and
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
the state could tax it if they chose to
 
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
it was I you tapered off at the end
 
00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:30.419 align:start position:0%
uh that the um it was allowed by federal
 
00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:33.059 align:start position:0%
law wasn't proven by state law uh and if
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
the state had chosen to tax it then it
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
would have been taxable but at the time
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
I would just remind committee members we
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
are not here to debate people who are
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
testifying and we are definitely not
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
here to suggest motives or anything like
 
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
that so just be
 
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
professional please thank you
 
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you so you may not be aware of it
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
but are you willing to look into it and
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
get back to us with an answer uh and
 
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
look into what I'm sorry whether or not
 
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
the operation was running illegally well
 
00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:06.539 align:start position:0%
I can tell you uh The Churchill Downs
 
00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:09.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean it wasn't illegal
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's you that's enough
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh
 
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:22.020 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair members of the

the chief compliance officer for the New
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lottery Commission
 
00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
um thank you for
 
00:28:39.169 --> 00:28:39.179 align:start position:0%
um having my testimony here today
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
um as Senator Lang indicated
 
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
um lawyer commission asked for this bill
 
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
to be put forward
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
um and the to give a little bit of
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
background on this and I know it's it's
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
been spoken about
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
um a bit
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
um Advanced positive wagering has been
 
00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
going on for quite some time uh multiple
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
decades I believe and and primarily at
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
this point in time it's done online I
 
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
think traditionally there was the
 
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
ability to actually call into the track
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
have a we have an account uh on hand at
 
00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
the track and be able to bet over the
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
phone and obviously as
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
um as we've gone into the era of
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
smartphones that has uh migrated to
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
online apps and several online apps are
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
currently operating in New Hampshire
 
00:29:27.889 --> 00:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
um and have been for some time and um as
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned TwinSpires which is
 
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh probably the largest in the industry
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
was operating for quite some time in New
 
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and voluntarily ceased
 
00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:39.860 align:start position:0%
operations in the fall of this year
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
after uh discussions with the Lottery
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
Commission and the Department of Justice
 
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
um to give a background on
 
00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
the legality of this activity
 
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
um there is as was mentioned a federal
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
law the interstate horse racing act
 
00:29:55.679 --> 00:29:57.110 align:start position:0%
law the interstate horse racing act
which

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
um permits
 
00:29:58.919 --> 00:29:59.510 align:start position:0%
um permits
um

00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
this type of activity to happen across
 
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
state lines for example sports betting
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
cannot happen across state lines it has
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
to happen within the boundaries of each
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
particular state where it's either
 
00:30:12.889 --> 00:30:12.899 align:start position:0%
authorized or not horse racing has broad
 
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
ability to cross state lines however
 
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:18.860 align:start position:0%
states have the ability to then either
 
00:30:21.289 --> 00:30:21.299 align:start position:0%
approve of that activity or disapprove
 
00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
of that activity so a number of these
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
operators operate in New Hampshire under
 
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
a license issued by the state of Oregon
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
um and and Oregon is the common state
 
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
for licensure for a number of them and
 
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
then the 50 states and territories
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
fall into sort of three different
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
buckets there are states that authorize
 
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
this activity specifically
 
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
and regulated and and uh and collect
 
00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:51.539 align:start position:0%
money from it there are those that
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
strictly forbid it and then there's a
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
gray area in between
 
00:30:59.450 --> 00:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
until now New Hampshire has laid in the
 
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
gray area and certainly the Lottery
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
Commission was concerned that some of
 
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
these activities may be in conflict with
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
some of our our gaming statutes we asked
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice to take a look
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
at this and they were as Senator Lang
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
indicated and I don't speak for the
 
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice but I used to work
 
00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
there I do not speak for them now and
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
when I worked there they didn't let me
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
speak for them so they certainly won't
 
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
do it now
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
um but there was you know essentially
 
00:31:30.409 --> 00:31:30.419 align:start position:0%
there was an inconclusive decision and
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately with respect to Churchill
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
Downs and twin spiers there was a
 
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:37.460 align:start position:0%
voluntary decision made
 
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
to to exit the market while it remained
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
in the gray area until we could operate
 
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
in the white area this is this bill is
 
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
essentially what we're trying to do is
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
bring this in to regulate the state to
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
buy the state directly so that we're not
 
00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
reliant on the regulations of Oregon or
 
00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
the oversight of Oregon
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
um and certainly we want to make sure
 
00:31:59.690 --> 00:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire players are protected
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
that the best practices of the industry
 
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
in terms of protection of personal
 
00:32:09.769 --> 00:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
account information responsible gaming
 
00:32:12.409 --> 00:32:12.419 align:start position:0%
um and and making sure that Wagers are
 
00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
protected and paid out properly uh is
 
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
all done in New Hampshire in in
 
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
accordance with New Hampshire rules so
 
00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
that is why we asked for this to come
 
00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
forward and we appreciate Senator Lang
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
uh taking that up for us one other thing
 
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
and then I'll certainly open up for
 
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.230 align:start position:0%
and then I'll certainly open up for
questions

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:30.889 align:start position:0%
questions
um

00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
Churchill Downs obviously brought
 
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
forward a number of uh revisions we do
 
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
not agree with the uh revision of the
 
00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:42.179 align:start position:0%
tax structure or the mark the the um
 
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
the market share agreement that is in
 
00:32:48.409 --> 00:32:48.419 align:start position:0%
there obviously it is different than the
 
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
um the rate that the tracks uh pay but
 
00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:54.539 align:start position:0%
certainly different
 
00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:55.549 align:start position:0%
certainly different
um

00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
different types of gaming are subject to
 
00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:00.419 align:start position:0%
different structures all the time tracks
 
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
obviously have a significant investment
 
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and significant uh
 
00:33:09.169 --> 00:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
cost basis in terms of the Personnel
 
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
that they employ here
 
00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:12.299 align:start position:0%
um and certainly that comes into effect
 
00:33:14.169 --> 00:33:14.179 align:start position:0%
when we look at what the appropriate
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
market share agreement for New Hampshire
 
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
is but with respect to the other uh
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
changes that are suggested those have
 
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
been discussed not just with Churchill
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
Downs but with other members of the
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
industry and the Lottery Commission
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
feels comfortable with the language that
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
has been proposed and would endorse that
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
that change and then one last thing and
 
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
then I will stop talking and answer
 
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.409 align:start position:0%
then I will stop talking and answer
questions

00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:39.419 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:40.860 align:start position:0%
um I understand that some of the local
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
tracks May
 
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
um be concerned about the
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
differentiation in uh in rate that
 
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
because they also to advance the
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
positive wagering we do not want to set
 
00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:54.539 align:start position:0%
up a situation where
 
00:33:54.539 --> 00:33:55.549 align:start position:0%
up a situation where
um

00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
local actors who are doing ADW are
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
treated differently I think that that
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
could lead to significant problems from
 
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
a legal perspective certainly Wagers at
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
the track will remain
 
00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
um main subject to the same tax
 
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
um but we're asking that all ADW
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
activities whether it be done by
 
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
national companies or done by New
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire companies be subject to this
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
new legislation if you were to pass it
 
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll end my remarks my I'm
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
sorry lengthy remarks
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:33.419 align:start position:0%
thank you very much a lot to learn uh
 
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
representative Platt I did not catch
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
what you do not agree with and perhaps
 
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
you could point out where it is on this
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
street uh so I do not have a copy of
 
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.430 align:start position:0%
street uh so I do not have a copy of
that

00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
it changes yes so that's those are the
 
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
changes they're asking for and then
 
00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:51.669 align:start position:0%
changes they're asking for and then
obviously

00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
they're yeah they're concerned about
 
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
that okay so it is uh page two line 12
 
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
the 2.25 they would like that reduced to
 
00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:02.339 align:start position:0%
one and a quarter
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
um and that is the only change that we
 
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
might take us a minute if you could just
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
give us a second to absorb all that
 
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
fabulous information
 
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.050 align:start position:0%
fabulous information
[Laughter]

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
I apologize I tend to run on very long
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
and with a lot of words we're also
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
taking notes so sometimes it takes a
 
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative Doucette
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question also uh
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
what Mr bragden offered was a change to
 
00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
the uh the bond at present
 
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
uh I know the one operator has to be
 
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
bonded would would Lottery be in
 
00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:47.339 align:start position:0%
opposition to removing that Bond
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
so so representative set thank you for
 
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
the question I as I read the language
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
and as we agree to it it does not remove
 
00:35:56.089 --> 00:35:56.099 align:start position:0%
the bonding requirement it makes the
 
00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
bond applicable to the payments to the
 
00:35:59.950 --> 00:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
state as opposed to
 
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
the accounts themselves the player
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
accounts themselves being bonded for the
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
player counts and that is similar to how
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
we do do it with tracks and with sports
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
betting right now essentially we protect
 
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
the player accounts by doing an overview
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
of we we ensure monthly that there's
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
enough money in the reserve account to
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
handle to cover all of the player
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
accounts so there is no need to bond on
 
00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
that we did uh when we drafted this
 
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:28.790 align:start position:0%
that we did uh when we drafted this
language

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
um that was an oversight on our part
 
00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
um we would not normally have gaming
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
bonds apply to player funds we again we
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
protect player funds through other means
 
00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:43.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
representative Rushford yes thank you
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for the coming
 
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
in today and I apologize that this was
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
um I was late myself but as I understand
 
00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
this the the operations right now or in
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
a gray area no one's really sure what's
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
going on what's you know the legislation
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
would clearly Define the activity so
 
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
skipping to the the last page on the
 
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
um you're estimating or assuming there's
 
00:37:14.089 --> 00:37:14.099 align:start position:0%
17 million dollars in this type of
 
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
wagering going on if this is
 
00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:20.339 align:start position:0%
kind of off the Record uh and and no one
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
really knows what really is happening
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
how did you come up with these numbers
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
to assume that level of wagering so
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
representative we we have had a very
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
robust conversation with the industry
 
00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
and the industry's actually been quite
 
00:37:37.609 --> 00:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
um receptive to regulation
 
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
um and these are these are discussions
 
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
that have happened over the last few
 
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
years along with our legal review with
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
um and so that number was based partly
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
on uh information that is known from
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
other states and doing a per capita
 
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
analysis but also from some direct
 
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
information that was provided by the
 
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
industry itself so we feel fairly
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
comfortable that that is a reasonable
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
effort at what is currently uh Happening
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative Janine
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
um there's been there's been ongoing
 
00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:17.339 align:start position:0%
concern that how do we prevent people
 
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
who are 18 years of age or younger than
 
00:38:22.849 --> 00:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
18 from betting and I see that
 
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
um on line 23 the commission will not
 
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.230 align:start position:0%
um on line 23 the commission will not
license

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:27.829 align:start position:0%
license
um

00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:29.750 align:start position:0%
um
a

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
Advanced deposit wagering um
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
place unless you have verified your
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
department is verified those methods
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
found how
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
how confident or how how is that done I
 
00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
I think a third-party app was mentioned
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
before do you know what that 30 party
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
app is and how confident are we that
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
that works yes so
 
00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.109 align:start position:0%
that works yes so
um

00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
different uh operators use different
 
00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
third parties so
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
um you know uh most of them actually use
 
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
multiple third parties to verify
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
um that an individual who signs up is a
 
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
um in a database and they they check
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
with their social security number their
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
date of birth their address and checking
 
00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
against public uh the the databases that
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
they use we have a very high degree of
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
confidence that um that those users are
 
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.650 align:start position:0%
confidence that um that those users are
verifiable

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
verifiable
 
00:39:27.609 --> 00:39:27.619 align:start position:0%
um also another piece of this is that
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
when they fund their accounts that
 
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
account also has to be tied to the
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
person who is
 
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
um who has signed up for the account
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
um in those instances where the database
 
00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.670 align:start position:0%
um in those instances where the database
doesn't

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:39:43.609 --> 00:39:43.619 align:start position:0%
because there are instances of that then
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
the person is prompted to put to
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
actually upload a picture of themselves
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
with their photo ID and again with
 
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
respect to gaming across the industry
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
whether it be sports betting or horse
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
racing or other eye gaming that is the
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
industry standard our experience with
 
00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
this is that there is a very very low
 
00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
rate of fraud online in fact these
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
databases are incredibly
 
00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:11.510 align:start position:0%
databases are incredibly
um

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:14.339 align:start position:0%
incredibly effective at identifying who
 
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
is opening the account
 
00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
and the data that is associated with the
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
account again both the the what we call
 
00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
kyc or know your customer uh information
 
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
that comes from the databases along with
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
geographic information that comes and
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
banking information that comes we have a
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
very very high degree of confidence in
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
who is coming in to uh to uh to to open
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
an account and operate an account
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
um and so those would all be things that
 
00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
would be would be fleshed out in the
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
plan of operation
 
00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
um and certainly we have an
 
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the what the
 
00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
highest level of Industry standards are
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
and we would hold operators to that
 
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.010 align:start position:0%
and we would hold operators to that
level

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative Rutherford yes thank you
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
madam chairs I apologize I made a note
 
00:41:07.609 --> 00:41:07.619 align:start position:0%
of this and didn't ask you so some of
 
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
the guidelines that it you know it sets
 
00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:11.339 align:start position:0%
out on page one
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
um starts on on line 22. the it it the
 
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
legislation uh defines at minimum that
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
the operator
 
00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.050 align:start position:0%
the operator
um

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
shall essentially submit a plan of
 
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.650 align:start position:0%
shall essentially submit a plan of
operation

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
for operating their their
 
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.089 align:start position:0%
for operating their their
business

00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:32.099 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
um and it and it defines six or seven
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
things that uh
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
that it requires legislative by
 
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
legislation and the last thing it says
 
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:44.220 align:start position:0%
other requirements established by the
 
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
commission enroll that seems pretty
 
00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:48.500 align:start position:0%
open-ended to me so I mean what other
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
requirements could you conceivably
 
00:41:52.079 --> 00:41:52.910 align:start position:0%
requirements could you conceivably
um

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
ask for that maybe we could tighten this
 
00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.109 align:start position:0%
ask for that maybe we could tighten this
up

00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:41:59.450 --> 00:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
rather than give a blank check to assist
 
00:42:02.089 --> 00:42:02.099 align:start position:0%
the commission so I I appreciate the
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
question I I certainly understand I
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
think if we knew specifically what we
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
were what other issues might arise
 
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
um that we would have enumerated them
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
um and so I certainly understand that
 
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
the legislature's hesitancy to provide
 
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
that open-ended or rulemaking authority
 
00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.210 align:start position:0%
that open-ended or rulemaking authority
um

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
what I would say is that often what we
 
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
don't this is a this is online gaming is
 
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
still a relatively new industry
 
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
um and the things that we see at that
 
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
come up as risks or things that we want
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
operators to do
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
um does change uh you know over a three
 
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
to six month time period we may see an
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
exploit that happens in another state
 
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
and it may be something that we would
 
00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
ask I'm certainly cyber security is
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
something that we have put into this
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
bill but in the past it's not something
 
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
that has been
 
00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:53.710 align:start position:0%
that has been
um

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
forward-facing in the legislation or in
 
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
the rule making but obviously that is of
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
the utmost importance right now we've
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
learned that so I guess the the my very
 
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:07.140 align:start position:0%
long answer is I don't know what would
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
come up
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
um I do think uh I understand the
 
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
reticence of the legislature I do think
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
from my perspective that having the
 
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
ability in rule making to be a little
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
more Nimble to address items as they
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
come up as opposed to coming back to the
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
full legislature and obviously the
 
00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
rulemaking does go through uh jailcar
 
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
um is necessary given the the state of
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
changes that happen in the industry and
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
the the tempo of those changes
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
um so I can't tell you right now what we
 
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
might be asking for
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
um but certainly if we if we did come up
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
with something we would want to address
 
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
it with jail car within a three to six
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
month period as opposed to the
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
legislature depending on the legislature
 
00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:56.050 align:start position:0%
legislature depending on the legislature
schedule

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:56.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up all right thank you and I get
 
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
that I mean especially in and I think
 
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
probably and I and I I understand and I
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
can appreciate the desire to be nimble
 
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
and especially in an industry that is so
 
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
Tech oriented I mean you look at what we
 
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
carry around in our pockets versus what
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
we carried around two years ago is a
 
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
huge difference but I I but I I hope you
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
can appreciate you know my concern in
 
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.710 align:start position:0%
can appreciate you know my concern in
that

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
um you know it's open-ended and you know
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
so I think we have some we see we see
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
each other's so what kind of language
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
could we put in there that would maybe
 
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.390 align:start position:0%
could we put in there that would maybe
um

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
um satisfy maybe some of my concerns
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
where we're giving an agency a blank
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
check to take technology and who knows
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
what with it I mean is there something
 
00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
that we could add there to approve by
 
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
legislature approved by Ways and Means
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
um not to exceed uh uh something like
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
that or is the or or is that the only
 
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
way that we could achieve what you're
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
you're looking for what it's written
 
00:45:05.809 --> 00:45:05.819 align:start position:0%
right now in number letter H line eight
 
00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
so I I think you know perhaps tying it
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
back to an already existing statutory
 
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
requirement say another uh other
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
requirements that would fulfill the
 
00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:20.099 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements as written
 
00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
um would make sure that we are not
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
wandering outside of your original
 
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.010 align:start position:0%
wandering outside of your original
intent

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
um I do appreciate the question and
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
understand the concern
 
00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:32.220 align:start position:0%
um it's just that I can't see the future
 
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
but I I do think that that would perhaps
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
um give you some
 
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.130 align:start position:0%
um give you some
um

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:39.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
uh assurance that we are not going to go
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
outside of what you you intended as you
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
approve this
 
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
um and obviously there are also the
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
controls in place of going through gel
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
car and ensuring and OLS is very
 
00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.349 align:start position:0%
car and ensuring and OLS is very
um

00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh very good about making sure that we
 
00:45:58.609 --> 00:45:58.619 align:start position:0%
don't wander outside of the statutes uh
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
Four Corners
 
00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
um so uh perhaps language to that effect
 
00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
thank you okay I do not have any more
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
pink cards on SB 190 is there anyone
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
else here who would like to speak
 
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
none we will close the public hearing on
 
00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.619 --> 00:46:34.069 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
okay we will now open up the peering on
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 189 and the chair recognizes
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor senator timley
 
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair it's been as long
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
as I've been here
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the opportunity to do
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
the spell but I do want to just take a
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
sight diversion to answer a question
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
that came up about rules and do
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
understand the rules I serve as the vice
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
chair of jalcar for freshman legislators
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
that may not understand what jail car is
 
00:47:08.809 --> 00:47:08.819 align:start position:0%
the joint legislative committee on
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and so anytime a
 
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner an agency wants to submit a
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
rule or rule change there are three
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
forms that the rules can take they can
 
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
do an emergency one which means that we
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
have an immediate issue that is Public
 
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:22.140 align:start position:0%
Safety related so a lot of times with
 
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
these coming out of DHHS in the
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
department of safety and because it has
 
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
a direct impact on citizen safety we
 
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
have an interim rule which is here's a
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
set of temporary rules we want to run by
 
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
while we run through rule making process
 
00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:35.579 align:start position:0%
and the last one is a final rule
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
proposal which is here's the rule we
 
00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
adopted after having public hearings and
 
00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
vetting it out so that comes before it's
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
a 10-member committee that's made up of
 
00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
both senators and legisl and house house
 
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
members that have to approve those rules
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
so in the case so what we just heard
 
00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:52.859 align:start position:0%
where we're granting a rule-making
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
authority to an agency just understand
 
00:47:56.089 --> 00:47:56.099 align:start position:0%
that's not a blank check it still has to
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
come back to the legislature and get
 
00:47:59.089 --> 00:47:59.099 align:start position:0%
approval from the legislature
 
00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
just to make sure you know it goes so
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
we'll go back onto this bill sorry for
 
00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
my little diversion there
 
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
um so this this bill was brought forward
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
at a constituent request
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
um the short version of this bill is as
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
members of ways and means you know that
 
00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
we've always have a concern about credit
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
carry forward how much money are we
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
holding on on to the state where um a a
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
person can take a deduction and we hold
 
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
it and we've we've made legislative
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
changes to reduce that credit carry
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
forward that dra holds from we're down I
 
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
think to 500 percent this year than 250
 
00:48:35.089 --> 00:48:35.099 align:start position:0%
percent in a future year and then it
 
00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
finally goes to we can only hold a
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
maximum of 100 of credit carry forward
 
00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
for a business liability what this bill
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
seeks to do is is address one of those
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
issues and it's it's relative to the
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
business interest expenses that a
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
business has currently a business can
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
has to take that deduction over four
 
00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
years so they're allowed to take 30 in
 
00:48:58.550 --> 00:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
the first year of that deduction and 30
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
percent than 30 in the third year and
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
then the end they can take the final 10
 
00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
to get 100 deduction out of their
 
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
business profit Stacks what this bill
 
00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:08.579 align:start position:0%
seeks to do is accelerate that and so we
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
don't have these carry forwards that are
 
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
going forward it says that 100 of what
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
they incur in the first year can be
 
00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
taken in the first year so we don't have
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
this carry forward of 30 30 percent
 
00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
10 in the next years forward that's the
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
short version of this bill
 
00:49:26.329 --> 00:49:26.339 align:start position:0%
um it just allows them to take that
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
understand that there are times when our
 
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
especially on multi-state businesses
 
00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
here in the state compete with other
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
states for the for the manufacture of a
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
product so I'm going to use things like
 
00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
freudenberg Anheuser-Busch that have
 
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
plants outside the state of New
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and when a business has to
 
00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:46.970 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and when a business has to
um

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
when a business has to compete for that
 
00:49:50.809 --> 00:49:50.819 align:start position:0%
product to make it in New Hampshire so
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
again a can of beer at Anheuser-Busch
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
can be made just as equally over in Ohio
 
00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
or down in New Jersey and so each each
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
plant basically bids or for lack of a
 
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
better phrase competes for who gets to
 
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
make that those you know 100 000 cases
 
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:08.099 align:start position:0%
of of beer or or makes the widget in the
 
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
manufacturing in the case of freudenberg
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
right they can just easily make it one
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
of their outside New Hampshire plants
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
and so New Hampshire is competing to do
 
00:50:17.569 --> 00:50:17.579 align:start position:0%
that so one of the ways we can help them
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
is to clean up this language to make it
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
so that second and third year they're
 
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
more profitable and be able to take care
 
00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:26.099 align:start position:0%
of that understanding that New Hampshire
 
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
still gets a hundred percent of its
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
revenue and none of this the only
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
difference is instead of taking it over
 
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
four years we take the hit in the first
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
year then we our rate our business
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
profits tax are raised in sec in year
 
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
two three and four because we're not
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
taking this deduction off the business
 
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.349 align:start position:0%
taking this deduction off the business
profits

00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
profits
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
um I I I'll happily take questions but
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest with you I am by no
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
stretch an expert in the IRS code 163j
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
but there are some people here who are
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
basically we're decoupling this from the
 
00:50:55.849 --> 00:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
federal government that allows this 30
 
00:50:58.609 --> 00:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
30 10 deduction and taking it all up
 
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
front that deduction all up front so
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
again I think the big thing for revenues
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
is ways and means we're talking about is
 
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
just understand that we still get all
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
the money we're supposed to get the only
 
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
difference is it's in the years that we
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
take it so
 
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator is this going your
 
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
bill lets us go back to what we were
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
just doing a few years ago is that
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
correct I believe it does we adopted
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
that we adopted the IRS code a while
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
back and then they changed the IRS code
 
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
and so we're still stuck with that
 
00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339 align:start position:0%
change and so we're looking to bring it
 
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
back to the way it was so businesses can
 
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
better compete this would let us
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
decouple from that yeah make you New
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.809 --> 00:51:41.819 align:start position:0%
representative play thank you my only
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
question Senator Lang is do you do
 
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.609 --> 00:51:49.619 align:start position:0%
um I I I believe in constituent service
 
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
and servicing our agencies so I tend to
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
get a lot of phone calls
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
representative almie thank you uh I am
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
really confused here because the
 
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
language that
 
00:52:03.609 --> 00:52:03.619 align:start position:0%
you've got
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
is totally different from that 30 30 10
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
can you explain how you get 30 30 10 out
 
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
of the that formula
 
00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.290 align:start position:0%
of the that formula
um

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.910 align:start position:0%
um
that

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
caps the business expense deduction to
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
the sum of business interest income 30
 
00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
percent of the adjusted taxable income
 
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
and floor plan financing expense
 
00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you so again I I my understanding
 
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
is this is a credit carry forward issue
 
00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:46.140 align:start position:0%
so again a business can
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
they have a hundred percent of the
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
deduction in the first year but they're
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
only allowed to claim 30. in the next
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
year they can claim the balance of the
 
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
30 in the next year because we only we
 
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
cap it at 30 percent so they can cap
 
00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
each year they can keep applying for
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
that credit carry forward of the
 
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
interest charge
 
00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:02.339 align:start position:0%
um against the business profits tax but
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
they have to take it over four years to
 
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
get the full hundred percent so thirty
 
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
percent thirty percent thirty percent
 
00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
and then 10 in the last year this just
 
00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099 align:start position:0%
moves 100 all the way up to the front
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
00:53:12.359 --> 00:53:16.010 align:start position:0%
that's all
foreign

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
I heard that
 
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
that the other parts of that formula
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
that I read are from our specific kinds
 
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
of businesses that maybe usually
 
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
wouldn't come into it I'm hoping someone
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
in in back is going to be able to help
 
00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
us figure out sure so again I I I'll ask
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
you to ask that question uh I think
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
Simon's going to speak Mr Thompson is
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
probably a good one to ask that question
 
00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
all right other questions over here yes
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth
 
00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
I'm Sharon thank you for taking my
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
question I didn't find the word in here
 
00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
is this in some ways enabling it or is
 
00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
it forcing them I was looking for kind
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
of the breakdown if it was better for
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
their business to still do the old
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
system can they
 
00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
I actually don't know the answer to that
 
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
question I know I know uh dra is here
 
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
and they maybe I'll answer it again
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
because it says allow businesses it
 
00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't say they must
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
I would argue that's enabling language
 
00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
it's not mandatory different needs thank
 
00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:19.670 align:start position:0%
it's not mandatory different needs thank
you

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna oh representative fellows
 
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
um yes I'm just wondering if you can um
 
00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
tell me the year or the bill number so I
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
could find the bill that changed it I
 
00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:32.579 align:start position:0%
honestly don't have that information
 
00:54:32.579 --> 00:54:36.650 align:start position:0%
honestly don't have that information
okay

00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee we
 
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
have other people presenting just so you
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
knows that may be able to get more
 
00:54:44.329 --> 00:54:44.339 align:start position:0%
technical on this uh representative
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
almond did you have another question are
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
you okay okay great thank you Senator
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:52.140 align:start position:0%
we will now recognize David Juve from
 
00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
I think it might be best for the
 
00:55:01.329 --> 00:55:01.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:08.329 --> 00:55:08.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:11.339 align:start position:0%

these handouts or information previously
 
00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
submitted to the committee but we
 
00:55:39.049 --> 00:55:39.059 align:start position:0%
thought it would be good to have it in
 
00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:45.660 align:start position:0%

chair Sanborn Vice chair jinnegan and

members of the House Ways and Means
 
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
Committee my name is Alan passetsky and
 
00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
I'm a tax consultant for the global
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
business Alliance or GBA and I'm
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
testifying today in support of sb189
 
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
GBA proudly represents nearly 200
 
00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
American companies with a global
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
Heritage and Advocates on issues that
 
00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
impact the U.S subsidiaries of
 
00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
international companies which employ
 
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:14.339 align:start position:0%
over 50 000 people in the state
 
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:16.140 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire employment and
 
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
international companies has increased by
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
22 percent over the past five years
 
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
while the state's overall private sector
 
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
employment has decreased by one percent
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire makes third in the nation
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of the concentration of jobs
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
created by foreign direct investment
 
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
with nine percent of the state's private
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
sector Workforce being employed by
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
International companies additionally out
 
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
of the state's entire International
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
based Workforce nearly half of the jobs
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
in the manufacturing sector and you'll
 
00:56:44.569 --> 00:56:44.579 align:start position:0%
find more of this information in the
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
materials we submitted before and that
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
you have in front of you now
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
so GBA supports 189 because it drives
 
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
business growth and employment in the
 
00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:56.339 align:start position:0%
state by decoupling from the interest
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
expense limitations imposed by the
 
00:57:00.829 --> 00:57:00.839 align:start position:0%
federal Internal Revenue code section
 
00:57:00.839 --> 00:57:02.450 align:start position:0%
federal Internal Revenue code section
163j

00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
163j
 
00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
let me explain a little further the
 
00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
federal and state income tax purposes
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
corporations determine their taxable
 
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
income simply by calculating the gross
 
00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:14.819 align:start position:0%
income subtracting their allowable
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
deductions one of the typical allowable
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
deductions for corporations is interest
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
expense the results from loans or debt
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
taken out to finance their operations or
 
00:57:24.839 --> 00:57:26.150 align:start position:0%
taken out to finance their operations or
expansion

00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
like ordinary business expenses interest
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
expense has always been deductible
 
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
but this deduction was severely limited
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
back in 2018 federally
 
00:57:41.089 --> 00:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
because of the tax cuts and jobs act as
 
00:57:43.069 --> 00:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
a trade-off for other items such as a
 
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
much lower Federal corporate rate
 
00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
when New Hampshire
 
00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
decided to follow and conform with the
 
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
federal code in 2020 they were two years
 
00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
behind which was good here New Hampshire
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
employers faced an inadvertent automatic
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
tax increase because they now conformed
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
sadly this tax escalates the cost for
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
companies who want to expand their
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
operations and increase employment in
 
00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:14.579 align:start position:0%
the state but thankfully SB 8189 New
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now has the opportunity to
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
join a growing number of states that
 
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
have realized this Conformity creates
 
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
bad policy for investment
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
in fact there are 18 states that
 
00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
certainly currently right now do not
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
impose any such limitation on interest
 
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
expense including Connecticut which
 
00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
decoupled a few years ago
 
00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
SB 189 would Finance would encourage the
 
00:58:38.809 --> 00:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
financing of new Investments which is
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
especially critical in this time of
 
00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
interest rate escalation
 
00:58:44.329 --> 00:58:44.339 align:start position:0%
so allowing for this full deductibility
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
by decoupling as SB 189 would do would
 
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
enable businesses to devote more
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
resources to Workforce Development
 
00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
initiatives research and development and
 
00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:55.430 align:start position:0%
initiatives research and development and
expansion

00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we urge the passage of
 
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
SB 189 to ensure New Hampshire remains a
 
00:59:02.329 --> 00:59:02.339 align:start position:0%
competitive destination for
 
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
international companies to create high
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
quality jobs I thank you representative
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
Moffett for sponsoring the bill and
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
chair Sanborn for the committee's time
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
and consideration and I'd like to answer
 
00:59:15.049 --> 00:59:15.059 align:start position:0%
any questions right now
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your
 
00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
presentation representative has a
 
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you madam chair thank
 
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
you for coming and explaining this and
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
just to break it down into to layman's
 
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
terms here so when I file my taxes
 
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:29.579 align:start position:0%
personally I can write a hundred percent
 
00:59:33.289 --> 00:59:33.299 align:start position:0%
of my mortgage interest off but as a
 
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
business I can't write 100 of my
 
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
business interest off because we've
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
coupled now with 163. yeah we have to
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
spread it out which then ultimately as
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding it creates a liability
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
for the state because we've got this
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
this deduction that's hang we're
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
carrying carrying forward
 
00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:55.260 align:start position:0%
correct thank you good question let me
 
00:59:56.809 --> 00:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
try to clarify sure because I think
 
00:59:58.370 --> 00:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
there's been some misunderstanding based
 
00:59:59.809 --> 00:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
on what I heard earlier
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
so like you said personal level you can
 
01:00:03.849 --> 01:00:03.859 align:start position:0%
deduct your mortgage interest in full
 
01:00:06.049 --> 01:00:06.059 align:start position:0%
businesses have this interest expense
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
limitation now it's a formula and you
 
01:00:11.089 --> 01:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
may not be able to deduct all of it
 
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
for the amount you cannot deduct it
 
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
carries forward into the following year
 
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
and now we run the calculation again and
 
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
see how much you can deduct if you can't
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
deduct all of that now it carry forward
 
01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
to another year
 
01:00:28.849 --> 01:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
so what this bill would do is it would
 
01:00:31.609 --> 01:00:31.619 align:start position:0%
say we're going to decouple and
 
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
beginning in 2024 you can fully deduct
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking about it as a small
 
01:00:47.569 --> 01:00:47.579 align:start position:0%
business owner who I have an LLC
 
01:00:47.579 --> 01:00:49.250 align:start position:0%
business owner who I have an LLC
versus

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
my brother who has who's Incorporated
 
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
this uh are there differentiations in
 
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire based on how you've
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
Incorporated so could I write as an LLC
 
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
my business right off 100 but his
 
01:01:04.849 --> 01:01:04.859 align:start position:0%
business only would carry right off
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
thirty percent thirty percent thirty
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
percent good question the provision
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
section 163j that's the code provision
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
only applies to corporations with
 
01:01:16.609 --> 01:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
receipts in excess of a certain amount
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
which I believe currently is 25 million
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
dollars it might be a little bit higher
 
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
if it was index for inflation but that's
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
the range so corporations that have less
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
than that number of receipts or operate
 
01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:30.059 align:start position:0%
differently as you said in a different
 
01:01:31.849 --> 01:01:31.859 align:start position:0%
form they're not a corporation they
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
might be an LLC they might be an
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:47.339 align:start position:0%
version of All Me yes uh that would be C
 
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
corpse C Corps correct
 
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
not escorts
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
on and
 
01:01:59.089 --> 01:01:59.099 align:start position:0%
we have no no way decent way of
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
estimating how much money we're talking
 
01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.870 align:start position:0%
estimating how much money we're talking
about

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:04.700 align:start position:0%
might hit
 
01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:07.150 align:start position:0%
might hit
the

01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
fy24 fy25 budget
 
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
on and I guess it would depend a lot on
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
whether a bunch of businesses decided
 
01:02:21.049 --> 01:02:21.059 align:start position:0%
okay we've been putting off making this
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
investment but now we're all going to
 
01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:25.140 align:start position:0%
make it in the same year
 
01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if there's any way
 
01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
given the huge numbers of oddities that
 
01:02:37.849 --> 01:02:37.859 align:start position:0%
we've found in on
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
that we've got in our tax code right now
 
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
around the business profits tax that we
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
could smooth this out
 
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
okay so to answer your question as you
 
01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:50.339 align:start position:0%
said and as we heard in the Senate
 
01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
hearing the dra determined this was an
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
indeterminate Revenue number because it
 
01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:57.059 align:start position:0%
just depends on so many facts like you
 
01:02:58.849 --> 01:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
said companies could decide to invest
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
more it also depends how much the income
 
01:03:02.569 --> 01:03:02.579 align:start position:0%
they have because when you run that
 
01:03:04.609 --> 01:03:04.619 align:start position:0%
calculation I mentioned you don't know
 
01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:07.220 align:start position:0%
all of those variables for every company
 
01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
so to your question about leveling and
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
it goes to your question as well
 
01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative Roche Ford is remember we
 
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
said that some interest is disallowed
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
and it carries forward to the next year
 
01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
and then you run the calc and it could
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
go forward so if we make this bill
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
effective 1 124 as proposed as you're
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
pointing out representative Almighty you
 
01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
have this carry forward perhaps for a
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
company from prior years now this was
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
effective 2020 so you'd have four years
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
potentially of carry forwards and I see
 
01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
your concern would be that not only
 
01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
would you be deducting your interest
 
01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
from 2024 but some of the interest that
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
came forward from the prior years and
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
turned about the revenue one way to fix
 
01:03:51.049 --> 01:03:51.059 align:start position:0%
that concern if people have that concern
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
on this committee is to provide that
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
that carry forward amount
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
prior years instead of being deductible
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
entirely in 2024 would be deductible
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
over a certain number of years say four
 
01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
years so in 2024 you would only deduct
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
your 2024 interest
 
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
and then you would take one quarter of
 
01:04:14.569 --> 01:04:14.579 align:start position:0%
your carry forward
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
2025 you would take the second quarter
 
01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:20.099 align:start position:0%
2026 the third 2027 the fourth and now
 
01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
you would be done you'd leveled it and
 
01:04:24.490 --> 01:04:24.500 align:start position:0%
now you'd be on a go forward only basis
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
we have actually drafted an amendment if
 
01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
the committee desires that would be a
 
01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
thank you representative janikian thank
 
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for taking my
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
question so in the scenario I just said
 
01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:47.579 align:start position:0%
if we leveled it over four years but but
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
in 2024 if a company made a new
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
investment that would be deductible the
 
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
whole thing immediately it's 2024
 
01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
interest yes would be fully deductible
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
it just the things coming from prior
 
01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
years you wouldn't get all in one shot
 
01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:04.619 align:start position:0%
which creates this potential Revenue
 
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
issue that representative Alma mentioned
 
01:05:11.289 --> 01:05:11.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
excellent are you local if we had a work
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
session on this uh to join us again I am
 
01:05:20.569 --> 01:05:20.579 align:start position:0%
not but I can be here very quickly thank
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
you wonderful and I do have a copy of
 
01:05:25.329 --> 01:05:25.339 align:start position:0%
the amendment I could circulate please
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
we tried to make it as simple as
 
01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
possible by just adding it on to the
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
current provision to expedite the
 
01:05:32.569 --> 01:05:32.579 align:start position:0%
process here so I'll pass that out on my
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
way out that would be helpful thank you
 
01:05:36.289 --> 01:05:36.299 align:start position:0%
very much oh representative fellows has
 
01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:38.819 align:start position:0%
a question thank you madam chair um can
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
you give me some kind of sense of the
 
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
federal restriction is does it only come
 
01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:47.900 align:start position:0%
into play when like a large percentage
 
01:05:51.549 --> 01:05:51.559 align:start position:0%
of their expenditures are are interest
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
interest payments it's actually a
 
01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
complicated calculation but to simplify
 
01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:56.750 align:start position:0%
complicated calculation but to simplify
it

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
you look at your total interest expense
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
from everything that's a number and then
 
01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
you look at your total taxable income
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
with some adjustments
 
01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
and you could take 30 of that taxable
 
01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:12.299 align:start position:0%
income as your deduction so if your
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
adjusted income is a hundred
 
01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
you can only deduct thirty dollars of
 
01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:18.170 align:start position:0%
you can only deduct thirty dollars of
Interest

01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
Interest
 
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
if you happen to have 40
 
01:06:23.569 --> 01:06:23.579 align:start position:0%
10 of it would not be allowed
 
01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
if you had 20 it would all be allowed
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's a percentage of your income
 
01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:36.299 align:start position:0%
that you're limited to in taking a
 
01:06:36.299 --> 01:06:37.609 align:start position:0%
that you're limited to in taking a
deduction

01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:37.619 align:start position:0%
deduction
 
01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:41.270 align:start position:0%
deduction
follow-up

01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about gross income or
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's taxable no it's taxable income with
 
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
special adjustments but we could just
 
01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:54.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.089 --> 01:06:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
we're trying to simplify it um although
 
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative Platt thank you for
 
01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
taking the question I assume that's a
 
01:07:10.849 --> 01:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
taxable not really taxable income it was
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
its income that would have been taxable
 
01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
except you have to add all the interest
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
back in so that you can do the
 
01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
calculation that is one of the
 
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
adjustments to add the interest back in
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Juve did you want to come up now
 
01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:33.059 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you because the only
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
other pink cards I have just FYI are
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
from the dra and I'm sure they'll be
 
01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
here to help us technically on things
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
uh Juve
 
01:07:44.809 --> 01:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the record my
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
name is Dave Juve I'm a senior vice
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
president for public policy with the
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association we are
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
here in support of Senate Bill 189. I'm
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
I want to actually take more of a 30 000
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
foot view level of this issue and the
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
first thing I think it's important to
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
understand is because this deals with a
 
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
decoupling from the federal tax code why
 
01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:12.299 align:start position:0%
States choose to couple in the first
 
01:08:15.789 --> 01:08:15.799 align:start position:0%
place and the answer is for businesses
 
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
in general it's helpful if state tax
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
laws mirror federal tax laws they're
 
01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
familiar with federal tax laws and it
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
makes state tax laws easier to
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
understand and follow
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
in 2020 if I remember back correctly
 
01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
when we chose to update our coupling
 
01:08:41.209 --> 01:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
with the federal tax code I believe
 
01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
up until that point we were coupled with
 
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
I think the 2012 IRS tax code so we were
 
01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
pretty out of date in terms of newer
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
federal tax regulations so the decision
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
was made to couple and as I said in
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
general that is something that's
 
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
beneficial for businesses
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
what happened in the specific instance
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
is with the tax reform acts the federal
 
01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
tax reform acts in 2017.
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
the federal government gave some things
 
01:09:15.289 --> 01:09:15.299 align:start position:0%
in the federal government took us away
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
some things one of the things they gave
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
was was lower overall Federal corporate
 
01:09:22.729 --> 01:09:22.739 align:start position:0%
tax rates
 
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
one of the things that they took us away
 
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that's proper grammar but
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
in order to make up for that lost
 
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue was reducing some deductions
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
that businesses previously were able to
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
take and this interest deduction was one
 
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
of those examples
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire is now coupled
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
and it makes sense on the federal level
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
because companies got to take advantage
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
of the newer lower tax rate at the
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
federal level and there was you know
 
01:09:58.250 --> 01:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
something that wasn't as robust as it
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
was but it all balanced out or maybe
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
worked out to their benefit
 
01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
what happened in terms of this specific
 
01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
provision at the state level though is
 
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
we were caught up in that deduction but
 
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
there was no corresponding benefit to
 
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
companies at the state tax level so
 
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I think you were correct in
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
in uh your statement earlier what this
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
bill is essentially doing or the result
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
of this would be to give back to
 
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
companies at the state level something
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
that they already had previous to that
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
federal tax reform
 
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I I want that was
 
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
mentioned but I want to emphasize is
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
that companies here in New Hampshire
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
um do compete with other companies
 
01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
around the country and they even compete
 
01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
within their own companies for other
 
01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
locations around the company and as the
 
01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
previous testifier noted a number of
 
01:10:58.729 --> 01:10:58.739 align:start position:0%
states have already moved to decouple on
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
this issue and many many other states
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
are considering doing so so we would
 
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to look
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
positively on this bill I would be happy
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
to try and address any questions that
 
01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
you might have
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
100 babies
 
01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
yeah just a uh maybe you can help me out
 
01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:19.910 align:start position:0%
yeah just a uh maybe you can help me out
here

01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
um it was mentioned that there's a
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
divide between big companies above 25
 
01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
million on
 
01:11:29.689 --> 01:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
and smaller companies and uh could you
 
01:11:29.699 --> 01:11:31.550 align:start position:0%
and smaller companies and uh could you
clarify

01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
how that the big companies the bigger
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
companies versus the smaller companies
 
01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
that are affected are not affected by
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
this change
 
01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
the the first of all it was the previous
 
01:11:45.729 --> 01:11:45.739 align:start position:0%
testifier that mentioned that not myself
 
01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
and I will take him at his word I don't
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
I am assuming that that is incorrect I'm
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
sure it is
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
um the change is that those larger
 
01:11:59.570 --> 01:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
companies are ones that have to comply
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
with that new change in the federal tax
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
code if you're if you have less revenue
 
01:12:09.370 --> 01:12:09.380 align:start position:0%
or you're structured differently uh
 
01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
according to the previous test fire and
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
I believe he is probably correct you
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
don't need to comply with those specific
 
01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
Provisions there may be others that that
 
01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:22.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
I was
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
so my understanding then is that
 
01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
this change
 
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
is helpful to those companies that are
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
above that 25 million dollar assuming
 
01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
all that's correct
 
01:12:41.330 --> 01:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
um are the ones that are helped the
 
01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
bigger companies and the smaller
 
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
companies are simply not not affected by
 
01:12:48.649 --> 01:12:48.659 align:start position:0%
this yeah they are not hurt by it but
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
but I if we can assume that all that is
 
01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.729 align:start position:0%
but I if we can assume that all that is
correct

01:12:52.729 --> 01:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
um that's correct this would benefit
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
companies that are above that threshold
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
but I would add those are also the
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
companies that are providing a huge
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
amount of employment in the state and we
 
01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:06.659 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that they receive that
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
help especially if it's just going back
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
to the way things were before and it's
 
01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
something that other states are already
 
01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:23.149 align:start position:0%
something that other states are already
implementing

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
us what the other
 
01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
States received that we didn't
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
you said that on
 
01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.229 align:start position:0%
you said that on
when

01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:13:33.239 --> 01:13:34.970 align:start position:0%
when
we

01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:36.470 align:start position:0%
we
um

01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
went into conf week went into Conformity
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
with what the tax jobs and uh tax cuts
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
and jobs act had done on that other
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
states got a benefit
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
on four
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
on that balance this provision whereas
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
we didn't no I I thought I must have
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
been unclear
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
all states
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
this would have impacted all states that
 
01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
were coupled to the federal tax code
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
what I meant to say and was I guess
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
unclear because of this negative
 
01:14:22.729 --> 01:14:22.739 align:start position:0%
ramification on at the state level a
 
01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
number of states around the country I
 
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
believe the number was 18 that the
 
01:14:29.209 --> 01:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
previous testifier said have already
 
01:14:31.810 --> 01:14:31.820 align:start position:0%
decoupled from the federal tax code
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
going back to whatever their previous uh
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
law was I don't if it was a hundred
 
01:14:39.649 --> 01:14:39.659 align:start position:0%
percent the way it was in New Hampshire
 
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
then it would have gone back to 100
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
percent I don't know what all the
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
individual state taxes were that they
 
01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
went back to but my point is
 
01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:51.900 align:start position:0%
they saw the ramifications of remaining
 
01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
coupled on this one provision and and
 
01:14:58.610 --> 01:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
implemented a decoupling for that
 
01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:00.229 align:start position:0%
implemented a decoupling for that
yeah

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:02.460 align:start position:0%
do you have followed yes
 
01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
um yes a second question
 
01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
if you remember it again related to that
 
01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
one uh
 
01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
isn't it so that on
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
if a large corporation
 
01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
moved here or stayed here they would a
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
number of them at any rate would be
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
using subcontractors inside New
 
01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:31.310 align:start position:0%
using subcontractors inside New
Hampshire

01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.630 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
I

01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:15:34.729 --> 01:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
well see I don't I don't really have a
 
01:15:37.810 --> 01:15:37.820 align:start position:0%
way of of answering that
 
01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
I perhaps I don't know but there might
 
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
be some Fallout that would help someone
 
01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:47.689 align:start position:0%
be some Fallout that would help someone
else

01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:15:47.699 --> 01:15:49.750 align:start position:0%
else
I

01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:52.820 align:start position:0%
you don't know I'm not sure okay
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis uh thank you this
 
01:15:57.649 --> 01:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
is a just a follow-up to representative
 
01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:00.500 align:start position:0%
Ames question do you have any idea about
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
how many companies fall into that above
 
01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
25 million here in New Hampshire that's
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
a that's a a good question I don't know
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
the answer to it but I know there is
 
01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
someone here from dra and in their
 
01:16:18.169 --> 01:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
um reluctant well they're they're
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
prohibited from talking about individual
 
01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
companies but they can talk about
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
companies in the Aggregate and they
 
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
might be able to help you with that I I
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question among the states
 
01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:37.820 align:start position:0%
this is a follow-up on representative
 
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
almie's question
 
01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there are about 18
 
01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:45.140 align:start position:0%
states that decoupled from the federal
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh regulations
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
what kinds of uh ramifications if any
 
01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
have there been either to
 
01:16:57.169 --> 01:16:57.179 align:start position:0%
companies choosing to or not to do
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
business in those States and on the
 
01:17:03.649 --> 01:17:03.659 align:start position:0%
revenues that those states are receiving
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
I I'm it's a great question I don't know
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
the answer to it I suspect some of those
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
changes are so recent that that we may
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
not know the answer but but I personally
 
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
can't answer that I don't know is there
 
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
anyone who does
 
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
and how do we get that information
 
01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:26.330 align:start position:0%
and how do we get that information
I

01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
I guess I would ask the dra if they
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
might be able to query uh their
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
counterparts in other states
 
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I'm trying to throw
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
dra under the bus but
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
representative all me yeah just
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
isn't on
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
would you agree that it's
 
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
um that this state depends a great deal
 
01:17:53.209 --> 01:17:53.219 align:start position:0%
more on our business profits tax than
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
any other state depends on their
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
01:17:59.930 --> 01:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
I would agree and have often made that
 
01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
point to the committee but I would also
 
01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
remind the committee what Senate Bill
 
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
189 is essentially doing is going back
 
01:18:12.649 --> 01:18:12.659 align:start position:0%
to a point that was all that was the
 
01:18:14.209 --> 01:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
case in New Hampshire relatively
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
recently so it's not in my mind it's
 
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
certainly making a change from where we
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
are now but the change takes us back to
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:36.780 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
maybe just some brief
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
information uh the the previous speaker
 
01:19:33.649 --> 01:19:33.659 align:start position:0%
did talk about the the IRC Conformity
 
01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
are the the uh for taxable periods
 
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
beginning on or after January 2020 we
 
01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
are in Conformity with the IRC of
 
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
December 3120
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
for taxable years for taxable appears
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
beginning on or after January 2020 uh
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire BPT is in Conformity
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
with the IRC of December 31 2018. and
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
the last time that changed prior to that
 
01:20:01.729 --> 01:20:01.739 align:start position:0%
was for taxable years beginning on or
 
01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
after Jan 1 2018 uh when we were in
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
Conformity with the IRC of December 31
 
01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.950 align:start position:0%
Conformity with the IRC of December 31
2016.

01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
2016.
 
01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.050 align:start position:0%
2016.
um

01:20:12.050 --> 01:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.050 --> 01:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
there were some questions on the um
 
01:20:23.689 --> 01:20:23.699 align:start position:0%
the the 25 million threshold uh
 
01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
essentially the 163 J limitation is
 
01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
applicable uh to it's Exempted it's not
 
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
applicable to taxpayers who meet the
 
01:20:40.729 --> 01:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
gross receipts test of the IRC 448 uh
 
01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
small C
 
01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:45.659 align:start position:0%
the gross receipts test isn't average
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
gross receipts for the previous three
 
01:20:48.239 --> 01:20:49.030 align:start position:0%
gross receipts for the previous three
years

01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:20:52.490 --> 01:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
that does not exceed 25 million and that
 
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
number is then adjusted with inflation
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
and right now it's 27 million
 
01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
just to be clear that's gross receipts
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
overall globally
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
they could be operating in New Hampshire
 
01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
for Less this would still impact them so
 
01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
that may encourage them to invest more
 
01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
here yeah yes the gross receipts is not
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
specifically for New Hampshire it's on
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
the on the on the taxpayer itself yeah
 
01:21:20.689 --> 01:21:20.699 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
are you open to questions now or did you
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
have more to present
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah we're open for questions okay
 
01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I wanted to follow
 
01:21:35.630 --> 01:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
up on a question I asked the
 
01:21:37.689 --> 01:21:37.699 align:start position:0%
Mr Juve
 
01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
when you give us Revenue estimates for
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
coming years you're basing that uh in
 
01:21:47.630 --> 01:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
part on the business taxes that will
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
come in
 
01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
if we wind up with a year when there is
 
01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
a significant shift or let me change
 
01:21:59.390 --> 01:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
that will there be at least a year where
 
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
there would be a significant shift if
 
01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
this system goes in where we're not
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
getting tax revenue over four years
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
in little pieces
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
but one year when all of a sudden we are
 
01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
not getting Revenue
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
in a big chunk
 
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
in one year
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative I believe I think that
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
question is really
 
01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
um it's a bit challenging to answer as
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
uh provided by previous testimonies it
 
01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
we cannot really predict how taxpayers
 
01:22:41.209 --> 01:22:41.219 align:start position:0%
behave in terms of their Investments
 
01:22:42.649 --> 01:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
whether they will make further
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
investments in the future and therefore
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
incurring additional uh interest on
 
01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.410 align:start position:0%
incurring additional uh interest on
indebtedness

01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
indebtedness
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
um essentially this is what it is it's
 
01:22:53.689 --> 01:22:53.699 align:start position:0%
uh the 163j limitation is a limitation
 
01:22:57.770 --> 01:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
on the on the interest in debtedness and
 
01:23:01.130 --> 01:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
as a two two speakers before us are
 
01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:02.090 align:start position:0%
as a two two speakers before us are
mentioned

01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
um you would calculate the limitation on
 
01:23:09.169 --> 01:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
a year-over-year basis so if the
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
following year the business
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
increase additional
 
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
um interest expense that would add on to
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
whatever that's carried on carried over
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
from the previous year based on current
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
law uh carried over from the previous
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
year to calculate what uh in a sense in
 
01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
essence is below the 30 limitation
 
01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:33.770 align:start position:0%
essence is below the 30 limitation
um

01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
without uh with this new proposed
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
legislation that 163j limitation would
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
be removed and the the taxpayers would
 
01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:45.020 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
claim the the full business interest
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
deduction in the year itself
 
01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.010 align:start position:0%
deduction in the year itself
um

01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
I guess the answer to the question is
 
01:23:58.610 --> 01:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
it's a short answer would be it's really
 
01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:01.790 align:start position:0%
it's a short answer would be it's really
indeterminable

01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative horse thank you madam
 
01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being here taking my
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
question so
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
you've looked at these numbers for no a
 
01:24:11.810 --> 01:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
lot of years
 
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
is it likely that a business that's
 
01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
incurring these types of interests in
 
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
one year gonna have it in a following
 
01:24:20.689 --> 01:24:20.699 align:start position:0%
year in other words
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
the business doesn't end it's ongoing so
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
year after year there's going to be this
 
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
either it's going to be I'll take it in
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
one year or it's going to be spread out
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
over three four years
 
01:24:33.649 --> 01:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
would you agree with that is that
 
01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
correct or
 
01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think you'll like the answer
 
01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.350 align:start position:0%
I don't think you'll like the answer
um

01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:41.630 --> 01:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
we we're not able to track that
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
information that deduction is taken on
 
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
the the federal level
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
um so it's a it's a line on the federal
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
return that we don't track it on on our
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
system so there's no specific line item
 
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
on the New Hampshire return it says okay
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
business interest deduction okay then we
 
01:24:59.330 --> 01:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
can track it
 
01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
so it's we're not able to okay so we we
 
01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
follow up please so we do get the
 
01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
revenue in year one we just it's not
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
spread out is that correct
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
under under current law you would get
 
01:25:16.729 --> 01:25:16.739 align:start position:0%
the deduction uh anything that's less
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
than 30 limitation you would get that
 
01:25:20.450 --> 01:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
deduction in the year one and then
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
anything in excess of the 30 is carried
 
01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
over the expense as a uh in excess of 30
 
01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:29.219 align:start position:0%
is carried over to the next year and
 
01:25:31.370 --> 01:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
that would be considered as a business
 
01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:33.780 align:start position:0%
interest paid or accrued in that other
 
01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
year and then add on to any other new
 
01:25:38.689 --> 01:25:38.699 align:start position:0%
business interests
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
um expenses incurred in that year
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
it all adds up together to calculate
 
01:25:43.199 --> 01:25:44.030 align:start position:0%
it all adds up together to calculate
that

01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
that 30 test again
 
01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
okay very good thank you
 
01:25:50.209 --> 01:25:50.219 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
representative almond
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
01:25:56.450 --> 01:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
Gene I can't remember if you were in
 
01:25:58.970 --> 01:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
your current position in 20. I don't
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
think so no so you can't it somebody
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
really should have at the beginning
 
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
explained to us what the process is when
 
01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:11.290 align:start position:0%
explained to us what the process is when
we

01:26:11.290 --> 01:26:11.300 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
we decide to couple or decouple can you
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
on when we decide to go to a new level
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
of the IRS uh
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
tax code
 
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
and that we want to use or not use the
 
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
changes they've made
 
01:26:35.209 --> 01:26:35.219 align:start position:0%
from what I can tell from the history of
 
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
the records that I that I could see is
 
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
that the dra did multiple I guess
 
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
presentations or uh
 
01:26:46.729 --> 01:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
provide information to to the
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
legislators I'm not sure if it's
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
specific to the house ways it means but
 
01:26:53.689 --> 01:26:53.699 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it was how Solutions yeah um so
 
01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
there were presentations in terms of
 
01:26:58.250 --> 01:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
each item that is relevant to New
 
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh with uh with regards to the
 
01:27:04.209 --> 01:27:04.219 align:start position:0%
the changes with the tcja
 
01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
what current New Hampshire BPD law says
 
01:27:12.649 --> 01:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
and then if conforming with the tcga
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
what's the impact if not conforming to
 
01:27:18.649 --> 01:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
the tcga what's that impact so that that
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
information was disseminated
 
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and it included in there was the
 
01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:30.709 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
do you have some more questions or did
 
01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
you want Enlighten us on well I'm having
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
trouble trying to figure out how to do
 
01:27:41.149 --> 01:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
this but I believe that we did not there
 
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
were incredible number of changes in the
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
tax cuts and jobs act and uh would you
 
01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
believe that we didn't get given all of
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
them to look at that dra did a first cut
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
and I can't remember whether dra whether
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
they showed us this one or not at the
 
01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.350 align:start position:0%
they showed us this one or not at the
time

01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.030 align:start position:0%
time
um

01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
yes there there were
 
01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
um multiple amendments to the original
 
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
bill when the tcga came out
 
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
um I think the the house had some
 
01:28:17.810 --> 01:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
amendments and then the federal on the
 
01:28:19.129 --> 01:28:19.139 align:start position:0%
federal side the Senate has some
 
01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
amendments before it was finally passed
 
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
um I don't I I'm going to suspect that
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
when um the dra made its presentation to
 
01:28:30.649 --> 01:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
the house Ways and Means or to the
 
01:28:33.770 --> 01:28:33.780 align:start position:0%
legislators it would have been after the
 
01:28:36.169 --> 01:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
bill was signed into law by the
 
01:28:36.179 --> 01:28:37.790 align:start position:0%
bill was signed into law by the
president

01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
president
 
01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
um yes yes and that would have already
 
01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
included all um relevant New Hampshire
 
01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.310 align:start position:0%
included all um relevant New Hampshire
related

01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
related
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
items which would include that business
 
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:52.490 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:28:54.649 --> 01:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
my colleague thinks that we did take a
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
01:28:58.750 --> 01:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
we don't remember why
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Cool broth did you have anything
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
that you wanted to add
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
no I'm just here because this is this is
 
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
complicated and two heads are better
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
than one okay great Tina's doing an
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
excellent job excellent thank you for
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
being here representative fellows
 
01:29:15.410 --> 01:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
can can you give me any sort of idea
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
about what sort of company would have
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
interest expenses that exceed 30 per 30
 
01:29:30.050 --> 01:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
of their
 
01:29:33.290 --> 01:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
taxable Revenue I mean
 
01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
is it 60 of their taxes or six six
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
Thirty thirty percent of their taxable
 
01:29:50.689 --> 01:29:50.699 align:start position:0%
income what sort of
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
company or what what sort of operation
 
01:29:57.770 --> 01:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
essentially this would be um applicable
 
01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
to businesses that
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
make that take out that uh that take out
 
01:30:09.239 --> 01:30:10.790 align:start position:0%
make that take out that uh that take out
loans

01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
loans
 
01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:11.629 align:start position:0%
loans
um

01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
that uh sort of
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
take out loans to to India in their
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
business activity so I I think that
 
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
would Encompass all sorts of businesses
 
01:30:25.729 --> 01:30:25.739 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of whether it is
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
it's below the 30 or above the 30
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
percent so that thirty percent is
 
01:30:32.090 --> 01:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
calculated on the adjusted taxable
 
01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:33.649 align:start position:0%
calculated on the adjusted taxable
income

01:30:33.649 --> 01:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:30:36.410 --> 01:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
um and so it's determined whether how
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
well that business is doing
 
01:30:42.169 --> 01:30:42.179 align:start position:0%
I I don't think we can really I I
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
personally cannot generalize which
 
01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
yeah in general manufacturing does have
 
01:30:53.570 --> 01:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
to have a lot of capital outlays in
 
01:30:56.990 --> 01:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
order to buy manufacturing equipment and
 
01:30:58.850 --> 01:30:58.860 align:start position:0%
the property and the so forth so they
 
01:31:02.209 --> 01:31:02.219 align:start position:0%
tend to have more borrowing costs
 
01:31:05.570 --> 01:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
if that will help you so there are
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
the only thing I can think of are like
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
too extreme so tell me if either of
 
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
these is not correct one of them would
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
be kind of like a startup company who
 
01:31:18.050 --> 01:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
who's buying like a lot of equipment or
 
01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
get you know setting something up but
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
hasn't really produced anything yet
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
would be you know need be paying
 
01:31:27.290 --> 01:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
interest on what they're trying to buy
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
on the other end would be something like
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
what what we heard about like a retailer
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
that's failing and so they didn't even
 
01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
have any taxable income because they're
 
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
you know in the hole so and and they
 
01:31:44.090 --> 01:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
probably were borrowing monies and that
 
01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
could exceed so I it seems like two both
 
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
of those be examples uh thank you for
 
01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
your question representative so as to
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
answer this specific question then go
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
back to your prior one maybe I'll take
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
them in reverse order so as far as which
 
01:32:01.490 --> 01:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
Industries uh we would have to defer to
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
what the prior speakers from Dave jubay
 
01:32:10.729 --> 01:32:10.739 align:start position:0%
from uh be IA and um and Alan from uh
 
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
from the Global Alliance uh in terms of
 
01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
their view of which specific Industries
 
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
are generally impacted we would defer to
 
01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.219 align:start position:0%
that we don't have a particular opinion
 
01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
on that as far as
 
01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
the uh to your second question uh it's
 
01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
it's generally taxpayers that uh incur
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
significant amounts of debt relative to
 
01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
their taxable income so
 
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
companies over the 25 million now 27
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
million threshold
 
01:32:51.290 --> 01:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
that don't have as much taxable income
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
because they might have significant
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
other expenses that are generally
 
01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
deductible and lower their gross income
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
down to their taxable income
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
that would be consistent with some
 
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers again we can't get into
 
01:33:07.450 --> 01:33:07.460 align:start position:0%
specific taxpayers but generally
 
01:33:10.129 --> 01:33:10.139 align:start position:0%
manufacturers tend to have significant
 
01:33:10.139 --> 01:33:11.930 align:start position:0%
manufacturers tend to have significant
expenses

01:33:11.930 --> 01:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
um other industries that are expense
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
heavy are going to see their taxable
 
01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:18.850 align:start position:0%
heavy are going to see their taxable
income

01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:18.860 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
significantly lowered and that would
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
that would pull them into this section
 
01:33:26.209 --> 01:33:26.219 align:start position:0%
of the IRC that would pull them into
 
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
this limitation
 
01:33:30.050 --> 01:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
and of course they have to have a big
 
01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
appetite for debt they have to be
 
01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
companies that are incurring significant
 
01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
amounts of debt in order to operate so
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
those are the type of companies that are
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
impacted by this
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's probably it's generally probably
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
not startups because they're probably
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
under the 27 million dollar threshold
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
but it certainly if they are rapidly
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
growing they could find themselves
 
01:33:58.129 --> 01:33:58.139 align:start position:0%
in excess of that threshold and then uh
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
to the extent they are incurring
 
01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
significant debt which many of them do
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
then they would find themselves impacted
 
01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:06.860 align:start position:0%
by this but it's it is probably
 
01:34:10.970 --> 01:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
generally more mature organizations that
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
have had the opportunity to grow find
 
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
themselves in excess of the the
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
threshold but require significant debt
 
01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
to operate and incur significant
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
expenses those are generally the types
 
01:34:25.570 --> 01:34:25.580 align:start position:0%
of taxpayers impacted by this
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
01:34:30.610 --> 01:34:30.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
so I understand that the bill
 
01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
essentially asks us to restore the
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
situation prior to the 2017 Federal
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
changes and the adoption of those
 
01:34:44.050 --> 01:34:44.060 align:start position:0%
changes in New Hampshire in 2020.
 
01:34:49.129 --> 01:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
am I correct that the mechanics here
 
01:34:51.290 --> 01:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
are that the bottom line of the federal
 
01:34:54.110 --> 01:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
return effectively is the top line of
 
01:34:56.450 --> 01:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire business profits
 
01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:57.890 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire business profits
return

01:34:57.890 --> 01:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
and so if we adopt this it'll be very
 
01:35:03.310 --> 01:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
easy to monitor in the years ahead
 
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
exactly what adjustments are being taken
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
because effectively the New Hampshire
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
business taxpayer would enter in an
 
01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
adjustment that would reclaim the
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
portion that they had excluded and
 
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
deferred on the federal return so we're
 
01:35:24.129 --> 01:35:24.139 align:start position:0%
going to be able to see precisely
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
and monitor this over the next several
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
years what impact it may be having on
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire revenues
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes uh thank you for the
 
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
question that that would be correct uh
 
01:35:38.209 --> 01:35:38.219 align:start position:0%
the that would be an additional line on
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
the BPT return just to record the the
 
01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
Delta between what's allowed on the
 
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
federal and what's allowed on the New
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
yes um there is a business in
 
01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:00.470 align:start position:0%
yes um there is a business in
uh

01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
the newspapers now
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
on which is very large
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
and incurred a lot of debt trying to a
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
mature business tried to incorp incurred
 
01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of debt trying to work its way out
 
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
of its whole and is now in bankruptcy
 
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
what happens to our tax when there's a
 
01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:27.770 align:start position:0%
what happens to our tax when there's a
bankruptcy

01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
not identifying that business obviously
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
taxes on profits though uh yeah thank
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
you for your question representative
 
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.070 align:start position:0%
you for your question representative
almi

01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
almi
 
01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:38.570 align:start position:0%
almi
um

01:36:38.570 --> 01:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:40.310 align:start position:0%
um
that's

01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
generally a complicated question we have
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
a team of lawyers here at dra and at doj
 
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice that we deploy
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
to protect the state's interests in the
 
01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy court system we have a team
 
01:36:57.649 --> 01:36:57.659 align:start position:0%
of lawyers at dra specifically that
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
monitor all bankruptcy filings and
 
01:37:04.129 --> 01:37:04.139 align:start position:0%
identify not just
 
01:37:04.139 --> 01:37:05.050 align:start position:0%
identify not just
um

01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:05.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
existing uh debt of the state but also
 
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
potential debts um
 
01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:14.030 align:start position:0%
potential debts um
um

01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
tax distressed taxpayers that
 
01:37:16.970 --> 01:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
potentially have a New Hampshire
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
obligation that has not been flagged for
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
the bankruptcy court so we do have a
 
01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
robust system in place to identify those
 
01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
potential debts that would be either
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
discharged or satisfied in bankruptcy
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
as to the specifics of any individual
 
01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayer obviously I can't get into that
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
and it does vary
 
01:37:38.159 --> 01:37:38.750 align:start position:0%
and it does vary
um

01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
I know our annual report or I believe
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
our annual report discloses our
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
the amount of bankruptcy debt that our
 
01:37:52.129 --> 01:37:52.139 align:start position:0%
lawyers are able to claw back
 
01:37:52.139 --> 01:37:53.209 align:start position:0%
lawyers are able to claw back
um

01:37:53.209 --> 01:37:53.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
but I don't have that number offhand
 
01:38:02.330 --> 01:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
and and again uh it is often the case uh
 
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
that if a if a taxpayer isn't bankruptcy
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
and they've been in significant distress
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
for some amount of time they may not
 
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
have much in the way of New Hampshire
 
01:38:14.209 --> 01:38:14.219 align:start position:0%
debt because almost by definition
 
01:38:16.970 --> 01:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
they've not been profitable for some
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
period of time sometimes it can come on
 
01:38:21.169 --> 01:38:21.179 align:start position:0%
quickly though where they have had a
 
01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
number of profitable years they do have
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
a potential liability owed to New
 
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're now in significant
 
01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
distress they've declared bankruptcy and
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
our lawyers will will make sure the
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
state's interest is protected and that
 
01:38:35.810 --> 01:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
the the back taxes do get paid and and
 
01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:42.649 --> 01:38:42.659 align:start position:0%
representative stream uh thank you for
 
01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
your testimony and thanks for taking my
 
01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:45.709 align:start position:0%
your testimony and thanks for taking my
question

01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:38:48.649 --> 01:38:48.659 align:start position:0%
um uh in terms of the tax cut and jobs
 
01:38:48.659 --> 01:38:49.669 align:start position:0%
um uh in terms of the tax cut and jobs
act

01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:38:52.729 --> 01:38:52.739 align:start position:0%
um uh you know as an offset I guess uh
 
01:38:55.490 --> 01:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
for uh some of the lower tax rates there
 
01:38:56.570 --> 01:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
were many
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
um uh limitations put on deductions uh
 
01:39:02.570 --> 01:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
one of which you uh which is directly
 
01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:05.159 align:start position:0%
addressed here is interest another one
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh I believe and I just asked for your
 
01:39:09.530 --> 01:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
confirmation on this but uh we were
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
talking previously about mortgage
 
01:39:14.209 --> 01:39:14.219 align:start position:0%
interest uh being something that's fully
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
deductible but in fact the tax cut and
 
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
job act reduced What's called the salt
 
01:39:22.129 --> 01:39:22.139 align:start position:0%
deduction or state and local taxes and I
 
01:39:24.410 --> 01:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
would just ask for for your view of
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
whether if your mortgage interest is
 
01:39:29.570 --> 01:39:29.580 align:start position:0%
high relative to your tax to your uh
 
01:39:32.290 --> 01:39:32.300 align:start position:0%
gross income
 
01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:33.910 align:start position:0%
gross income
whether

01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
at least federally whether your mortgage
 
01:39:38.689 --> 01:39:38.699 align:start position:0%
interest would no longer be effectively
 
01:39:40.510 --> 01:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
fully deductible
 
01:39:44.209 --> 01:39:44.219 align:start position:0%
because of the salt limitations so and
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
that's something that's not addressed At
 
01:39:47.209 --> 01:39:47.219 align:start position:0%
All by this bill
 
01:39:53.149 --> 01:39:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:57.229 --> 01:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
um I think I think my answer is that um
 
01:39:59.450 --> 01:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
the this bill is relating to the
 
01:40:01.490 --> 01:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
business interest deduction and not to
 
01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
mortgage interest deduction
 
01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:05.629 align:start position:0%
mortgage interest deduction
um

01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:05.639 --> 01:40:07.129 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:40:07.129 --> 01:40:07.139 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and I
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the answer how mortgage
 
01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
interest deduction is impacted
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
satisfactory yeah that is kind of really
 
01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
separate from what we're entertaining
 
01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
here um but we could certainly uh maybe
 
01:40:23.930 --> 01:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
next year or later this fall welcome
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
back the CPA Society they've given us a
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
nice overview of taxes we could welcome
 
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
them back to do that representative orrs
 
01:40:32.450 --> 01:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Karen thanks for taking
 
01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
my question so you guys are obviously
 
01:40:37.490 --> 01:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
excuse me a wealth of knowledge
 
01:40:40.129 --> 01:40:40.139 align:start position:0%
in your opinion or in your estimation
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
with your experience I probably should
 
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.010 align:start position:0%
with your experience I probably should
ask

01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
is there any material difference in the
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
revenue stream from year to year do you
 
01:40:51.050 --> 01:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
think whether we went back to 17 18 19
 
01:40:53.450 --> 01:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
if this was changed in other words on a
 
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
12 billion dollar Revenue you know
 
01:40:57.950 --> 01:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
budget or 14 billion dollar budget or
 
01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
this year maybe a 15 billion dollar is
 
01:41:03.290 --> 01:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
the the number we're looking at is it
 
01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:05.890 align:start position:0%
the the number we're looking at is it
material

01:41:05.890 --> 01:41:05.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh once again that's a that's a question
 
01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:10.679 align:start position:0%
that we might not be able to answer uh
 
01:41:13.129 --> 01:41:13.139 align:start position:0%
because when looking back at the the
 
01:41:16.010 --> 01:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
revenue stream as you can tell
 
01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:16.729 align:start position:0%
revenue stream as you can tell
um

01:41:16.729 --> 01:41:16.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:18.649 --> 01:41:18.659 align:start position:0%
during covet when you were expecting
 
01:41:22.250 --> 01:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
that business taxes would drop
 
01:41:24.530 --> 01:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
however businesses were doing really
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
well and our business revenues had
 
01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:29.570 align:start position:0%
well and our business revenues had
increased

01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
increased
 
01:41:32.209 --> 01:41:32.219 align:start position:0%
it is there's so many elements that's in
 
01:41:34.609 --> 01:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
play that goes into the the business
 
01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue business tax revenue that we
 
01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
collect uh so this
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
because of that change from um when we
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
were in conformity
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
with the the tcga is also right about
 
01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
the time with
 
01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:52.010 align:start position:0%
the time with
um

01:41:52.010 --> 01:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
with covet
 
01:41:57.169 --> 01:41:57.179 align:start position:0%
it's it's really not we're not really
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
able to track anything uh in that in
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
that area thank you
 
01:42:05.330 --> 01:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
representative jinnegan thank you madam
 
01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:05.990 align:start position:0%
representative jinnegan thank you madam
chair

01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be fair to say that while we
 
01:42:13.850 --> 01:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
may be concerned what we're losing by
 
01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
implementing this we don't know what
 
01:42:18.050 --> 01:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
we're gaining by implementing this
 
01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
because where there is competition among
 
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.510 align:start position:0%
because where there is competition among
states

01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.209 --> 01:42:26.219 align:start position:0%
who knows there could be companies
 
01:42:28.129 --> 01:42:28.139 align:start position:0%
that'll say okay yeah New Hampshire is
 
01:42:30.169 --> 01:42:30.179 align:start position:0%
now one of those States I want to invest
 
01:42:30.179 --> 01:42:30.890 align:start position:0%
now one of those States I want to invest
in

01:42:30.890 --> 01:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:42:33.169 --> 01:42:33.179 align:start position:0%
and so now we're potentially collecting
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
more business profits uh because now
 
01:42:37.609 --> 01:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
that state that company has decided to
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
do operations in this state is that true
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
I believe that could could be a
 
01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
potential um
 
01:42:48.169 --> 01:42:48.179 align:start position:0%
outcome of the of the bill
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
but of course we don't have a crystal
 
01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:54.229 align:start position:0%
but of course we don't have a crystal
ball

01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:57.659 align:start position:0%
other questions for the dra
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and they gave us a great quick
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
guide hopefully you all have that
 
01:43:03.890 --> 01:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
um and maybe did you send the tax
 
01:43:06.890 --> 01:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
Foundation information as well yes the
 
01:43:09.649 --> 01:43:09.659 align:start position:0%
the list with the states yes yes
 
01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:11.639 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you I want to make sure
 
01:43:13.490 --> 01:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
everyone saw that okay great I don't
 
01:43:16.270 --> 01:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
have any other pink cards on Senate Bill
 
01:43:19.970 --> 01:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
189 are there's anyone else oh rep uh I
 
01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:21.229 align:start position:0%
189 are there's anyone else oh rep uh I
apologize

01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:27.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:43:27.770 --> 01:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna invite back let me see if
 
01:43:33.649 --> 01:43:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
if you'd allow me five minutes two
 
01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
minutes two minutes two minutes thank
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
you so many points that were made okay
 
01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
thank you left unanswered perhaps and
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
try to clarify
 
01:43:43.129 --> 01:43:43.139 align:start position:0%
um there was a question by
 
01:43:45.649 --> 01:43:45.659 align:start position:0%
representative elberger a while ago
 
01:43:47.810 --> 01:43:47.820 align:start position:0%
which asked about the other states that
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
decoupled and is there any study that
 
01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:51.719 align:start position:0%
might show the revenue impact of that
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
and I can pretty safely say that data
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist it's just so nuanced as
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
dra said to actually tailor a revenue to
 
01:44:01.370 --> 01:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
this specific provision in a specific
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
year that I but I will say that no state
 
01:44:06.649 --> 01:44:06.659 align:start position:0%
that has decoupled has attempted to
 
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
recouple because of a perceived Revenue
 
01:44:11.209 --> 01:44:11.219 align:start position:0%
loss from what they did beginning in
 
01:44:14.209 --> 01:44:14.219 align:start position:0%
2018 or later to a question by
 
01:44:16.729 --> 01:44:16.739 align:start position:0%
representative fellows on the types of
 
01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
companies that might be subject to this
 
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
other than the 27 million dollar
 
01:44:22.729 --> 01:44:22.739 align:start position:0%
threshold and again that threshold is
 
01:44:25.729 --> 01:44:25.739 align:start position:0%
receipts so it's any dollar a company
 
01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
gets anywhere it's not New Hampshire so
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's many companies subject to this
 
01:44:32.689 --> 01:44:32.699 align:start position:0%
it's not industry specific I agree with
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
the comments made by several including
 
01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
the chair that it's typically Capital
 
01:44:38.570 --> 01:44:38.580 align:start position:0%
intensive manufacturing Industries
 
01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
because they borrow the most but all
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
companies will borrow just like people
 
01:44:45.169 --> 01:44:45.179 align:start position:0%
borrow to buy a house many few people
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
are paying cash companies invest their
 
01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
their profits so they don't have cash
 
01:44:51.709 --> 01:44:51.719 align:start position:0%
available so they borrow even if a
 
01:44:53.689 --> 01:44:53.699 align:start position:0%
company decides they want to put some
 
01:44:55.490 --> 01:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
office space in across the street to do
 
01:44:56.810 --> 01:44:56.820 align:start position:0%
something they may have to invest in
 
01:44:58.850 --> 01:44:58.860 align:start position:0%
that office space they'll take out a
 
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
loan to invest and they may not have the
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
taxable income number to deduct all the
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
interest on that loan I mean our
 
01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
organization has 200 members of all
 
01:45:10.850 --> 01:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
industries from Pharmaceuticals to food
 
01:45:13.129 --> 01:45:13.139 align:start position:0%
and beverage companies to Consumer good
 
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
companies to r d companies and that
 
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
would be another one that would be very
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
subjective to this is company investing
 
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
in research and development so it really
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
is industry neutral for the most part
 
01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
really is across the board that this
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
would apply
 
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
um and I think to uh representative
 
01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
janigan um to your point and I think it
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
was a great Point as we're talking about
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
the revenue potential loss again this
 
01:45:37.609 --> 01:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
does get us back just to what the
 
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
revenue would have been in 2019 it's not
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
creating a new law it's going back to
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
where we were and New Hampshire has
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
decoupled before recently with bonus
 
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
depreciation Section 179 so it's not new
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
ground but you're right if any
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
Investments come in as a result of this
 
01:45:56.209 --> 01:45:56.219 align:start position:0%
and they should that will increase
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
revenues from those Investments which
 
01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
will trickle down to not only the large
 
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
companies the larger making investment
 
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
but to the suppliers and the other
 
01:46:07.370 --> 01:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses in the state that
 
01:46:09.770 --> 01:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
will operate with the larger company so
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
it will trickle down as well so I hope
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
that clarifies some of the questions
 
01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:17.570 align:start position:0%
that clarifies some of the questions
raised

01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:19.970 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
okay

01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:22.970 --> 01:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
all right any other pin cards for Senate
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 189
 
01:46:27.290 --> 01:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will now close the public
 
01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.609 --> 01:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
okay and we will now open up the hearing
 
01:46:42.890 --> 01:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 260 and the chair
 
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
recognizes the prime sponsor Senator Tim
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
Lang welcome back thank you I believe
 
01:46:49.609 --> 01:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
this is my last bill
 
01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
um in front of ways it means so
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
um this bill was brought to the
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
constituent requests
 
01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
um they a constituent called me and
 
01:46:59.330 --> 01:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
asked me to look into an issue that they
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
were having with dra and the issue was
 
01:47:04.810 --> 01:47:04.820 align:start position:0%
this so and it's a yes if you understand
 
01:47:07.729 --> 01:47:07.739 align:start position:0%
uh llc's and specifically professional
 
01:47:10.370 --> 01:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
LLCs so dentist dental offices medical
 
01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:12.129 align:start position:0%
LLCs so dentist dental offices medical
practices

01:47:12.129 --> 01:47:12.139 align:start position:0%
practices
 
01:47:15.410 --> 01:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
lawyers office CPAs you can't start one
 
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
of those practices unless you are
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
actually a dentist a lawyer a doctor or
 
01:47:22.609 --> 01:47:22.619 align:start position:0%
a CPA I can open a CPA firm I need to be
 
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
a CPA in order to do that so what
 
01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
happens in llc's is that you have
 
01:47:30.649 --> 01:47:30.659 align:start position:0%
members uh the member owners as well as
 
01:47:32.689 --> 01:47:32.699 align:start position:0%
you may have W-2 employees in the
 
01:47:34.729 --> 01:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
instance of the constituent it gave me
 
01:47:36.129 --> 01:47:36.139 align:start position:0%
it was a dental practice
 
01:47:39.050 --> 01:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
and he had a situation where he had
 
01:47:41.209 --> 01:47:41.219 align:start position:0%
three member owner dentists and
 
01:47:43.370 --> 01:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
three-member owner W-2 employees who
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
worked for the dentist
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
and so if you're a W-2 employee you know
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
you get you get your your salary your
 
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
fix your fixed salary and then you may
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
get a bonus based on your
 
01:47:56.330 --> 01:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
um effort how much effort and how much
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
money you made the company you'll get a
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
bonus based on that and doctor's terms
 
01:48:01.609 --> 01:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
they talk about rvus or relative value
 
01:48:04.430 --> 01:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
units for a given procedure no more rvus
 
01:48:06.050 --> 01:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
you have the more your bonus structures
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
is increased
 
01:48:10.370 --> 01:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
um and and that that follows across a
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
lot of Industries like lawyers and CPAs
 
01:48:14.169 --> 01:48:14.179 align:start position:0%
the amount of effort you put in is is
 
01:48:16.609 --> 01:48:16.619 align:start position:0%
consummate to the amount of bonus
 
01:48:18.590 --> 01:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
compensation you may receive above and
 
01:48:19.850 --> 01:48:19.860 align:start position:0%
beyond your salary
 
01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:22.739 align:start position:0%
if you're a member owner those num those
 
01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
names change even though they are
 
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to mean the same thing as your
 
01:48:28.729 --> 01:48:28.739 align:start position:0%
member owner you may get a draw
 
01:48:31.490 --> 01:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
instead of a salary and you may get a
 
01:48:34.970 --> 01:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
disbursement instead of a bonus the idea
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
being in this in this particular
 
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
instance with the with the owner was
 
01:48:39.890 --> 01:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
they were
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
dra had
 
01:48:44.090 --> 01:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
um charged them the business profits tax
 
01:48:46.010 --> 01:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
for the disbursement to the owners even
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
though the Compensation Plan was equal
 
01:48:50.570 --> 01:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
to that of the W-2 employees so again so
 
01:48:52.850 --> 01:48:52.860 align:start position:0%
say a W-2 employee makes a hundred
 
01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and has a hundred
 
01:48:55.970 --> 01:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar bonus and then the owner
 
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.719 align:start position:0%
takes a hundred thousand dollar draw and
 
01:48:59.629 --> 01:48:59.639 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollar
 
01:48:59.639 --> 01:49:01.430 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollar
um

01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:03.410 --> 01:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
disbursement they were treating 100
 
01:49:05.570 --> 01:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
dollar disbursement as business profits
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
disbursement and charging them eight
 
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
point five percent on that when I
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
reached out to dra and I asked that
 
01:49:14.090 --> 01:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
question does this happen
 
01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
the interesting word I got back was
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
generally no
 
01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
which wasn't didn't make me feel warm
 
01:49:22.609 --> 01:49:22.619 align:start position:0%
and fuzzy with tra right it either
 
01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
happens or it doesn't happen and if it's
 
01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
happening and we're charging companies
 
01:49:27.530 --> 01:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
we're charging what is considered comp
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
fair and reasonable compensation as
 
01:49:32.090 --> 01:49:32.100 align:start position:0%
business profits because they're owners
 
01:49:34.370 --> 01:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
that's an income tax and that's not what
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
was meant to happen
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
and so what this bill does is seeks to
 
01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
clean that language up to make it clear
 
01:49:43.010 --> 01:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
to dra that as long as the owner member
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
is taking a compensation that is
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
equivalent to the industry so again in
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
the case if I talked to the W-2 employee
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
against a hundred thousand dollar bonus
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
I mean a hundred thousand dollars salary
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
and a hundred thousand dollar bonus if
 
01:49:55.850 --> 01:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
the owners are taking a similar a
 
01:49:57.530 --> 01:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
similar type of compensation that's
 
01:49:59.390 --> 01:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
that's commensurate with the industry
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
then that should be treated as income
 
01:50:03.649 --> 01:50:03.659 align:start position:0%
and not profits disbursement
 
01:50:03.659 --> 01:50:04.910 align:start position:0%
and not profits disbursement
um

01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
so uh so that's the is there were two
 
01:50:09.410 --> 01:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
amendments done in the house so this
 
01:50:11.209 --> 01:50:11.219 align:start position:0%
bill passed the Ways and Means Committee
 
01:50:13.129 --> 01:50:13.139 align:start position:0%
with an amendment the amendment fixed a
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
typo somehow we we made the deduction to
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
the interest and dividends tax when it
 
01:50:19.729 --> 01:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
meant to go to the business profits tax
 
01:50:23.930 --> 01:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
so we had to add 77-a not just 77 uh so
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
that uh that uh editorial uh comment was
 
01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
fixed and then the other thing we did on
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
the bill was just to make sure and it
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
was a dra comment that happened in the
 
01:50:35.570 --> 01:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
in the bill in the hearing um there was
 
01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
some concern about we could potentially
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
open up for a duplicate duplicate
 
01:50:41.090 --> 01:50:41.100 align:start position:0%
deduction allowing someone to take their
 
01:50:42.649 --> 01:50:42.659 align:start position:0%
full compensation deduction at the
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
federal level and take it again at the
 
01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
state level so you'll see on the bill on
 
01:50:49.850 --> 01:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
um lines four and five we talk about
 
01:50:52.129 --> 01:50:52.139 align:start position:0%
that to the extent that the amounts are
 
01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
not already deducted in here in arriving
 
01:50:56.090 --> 01:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
at the business organizational gross
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
income profits tax so again what we want
 
01:51:00.350 --> 01:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure is that I think it was
 
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative Pillsbury talked about
 
01:51:04.370 --> 01:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
the bottom line of the federal number
 
01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
becomes a Top Line of the state number
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to business profits tax we
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
want to want to make make it absolutely
 
01:51:11.330 --> 01:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
clear that they cannot deduct it again
 
01:51:13.250 --> 01:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
and so it's kind of a belt and
 
01:51:14.810 --> 01:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
suspenders action we don't think that
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
would happen but we also want to make
 
01:51:18.649 --> 01:51:18.659 align:start position:0%
sure that it never does either so that's
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:51:22.490 --> 01:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if anybody else has
 
01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:23.820 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak someone else may have
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative homie
 
01:51:28.970 --> 01:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
in 2009
 
01:51:34.970 --> 01:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
I and representative hatch and the
 
01:51:37.850 --> 01:51:37.860 align:start position:0%
entire Ways and Means Committee spent an
 
01:51:42.169 --> 01:51:42.179 align:start position:0%
incredible amount of time working uh
 
01:51:42.179 --> 01:51:43.669 align:start position:0%
incredible amount of time working uh
reworking

01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
reworking
 
01:51:43.679 --> 01:51:46.790 align:start position:0%
reworking
77a43

01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
which is the the fair and reasonable
 
01:51:53.450 --> 01:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
compensation for actual natural purpose
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
Services of a natural person who is a
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
proprietor partner or uh member or
 
01:52:02.159 --> 01:52:04.390 align:start position:0%
proprietor partner or uh member or
member

01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
member
 
01:52:07.609 --> 01:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
provided to the business organization
 
01:52:07.619 --> 01:52:08.930 align:start position:0%
provided to the business organization
on

01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:52:14.350 --> 01:52:14.360 align:start position:0%
that is not a profit that is on
 
01:52:17.689 --> 01:52:17.699 align:start position:0%
compensation for the work that you did
 
01:52:21.290 --> 01:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
inside of the business
 
01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:22.310 align:start position:0%
inside of the business
um

01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
and for on behalf of the business
 
01:52:29.209 --> 01:52:29.219 align:start position:0%
it had been uh monkeyed with shall we
 
01:52:33.229 --> 01:52:33.239 align:start position:0%
say in Prior years for about eight years
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
or more
 
01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:35.810 align:start position:0%
or more
um

01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:38.450 --> 01:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
and we needed to make sure that was
 
01:52:39.709 --> 01:52:39.719 align:start position:0%
never done again
 
01:52:43.070 --> 01:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
it sounds like what you're asking for is
 
01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:44.090 align:start position:0%
it sounds like what you're asking for is
what

01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:52:46.930 --> 01:52:46.940 align:start position:0%
the same is what this is
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
this does apply also to LLCs that are
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
filing business profits tax return is a
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
proprietorship or partnership which I
 
01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
think is what you're describing
 
01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
and which was the entire reason for
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
doing this because the LLC tax
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
made us realize what was going on
 
01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
in terms of fair and reasonable
 
01:53:15.770 --> 01:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
compensation and you're coming in with
 
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
yet another paragraph at the very end of
 
01:53:21.780 --> 01:53:22.970 align:start position:0%
yet another paragraph at the very end of
of

01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:29.820 align:start position:0%
that is adding in customary which is not
 
01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:31.790 align:start position:0%
that is adding in customary which is not
defined

01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
defined
 
01:53:35.950 --> 01:53:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh too fair and reasonable compensation
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
and I thought you were trying to talk
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
about corporations being added in but
 
01:53:44.450 --> 01:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
about LLCs which are being run
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
as a partnership
 
01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:53.810 align:start position:0%
as a partnership
correct

01:53:53.810 --> 01:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question so again
 
01:53:58.370 --> 01:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
this this bill was driven by again first
 
01:54:00.410 --> 01:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
the constituent response and then dra's
 
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
response said generally it didn't happen
 
01:54:03.890 --> 01:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
which means that it does happen on
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
occasion and the purpose of the bill is
 
01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
to make it absolutely crystal clear that
 
01:54:09.890 --> 01:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
we don't have an income tax in the state
 
01:54:11.709 --> 01:54:11.719 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and we're not taxing
 
01:54:14.330 --> 01:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
draws and disbursements that are
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable and customary to be
 
01:54:17.629 --> 01:54:17.639 align:start position:0%
considered compensation we're not
 
01:54:22.189 --> 01:54:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
representative self-worth
 
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:54:28.250 --> 01:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
taking my question I appreciate that you
 
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
came forward for a constituent I think
 
01:54:32.689 --> 01:54:32.699 align:start position:0%
we all try to do that but I'm always a
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
little skeptical about a legislation
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's kind of tied to one or two
 
01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
constituents it appears at the moment
 
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
that there's not a broad need or I just
 
01:54:43.129 --> 01:54:43.139 align:start position:0%
think we would have more people here and
 
01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
more people you know representatives
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
from the business community so um it you
 
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
really like you said before this really
 
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
was for one constituent and then you
 
01:54:54.050 --> 01:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
thought there might be a couple more
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
so let me be clear so I started with one
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
constituent but once I broached the
 
01:55:01.609 --> 01:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
subject I had lawyers contact me with
 
01:55:03.410 --> 01:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
issues that said that this is a similar
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
thing they were running into that's why
 
01:55:08.330 --> 01:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
I reprovise those firms CPA firm reached
 
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
out to me and said this is a similar
 
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
concern of them so while I started this
 
01:55:12.649 --> 01:55:12.659 align:start position:0%
conversation because of a single
 
01:55:14.689 --> 01:55:14.699 align:start position:0%
constituent request I will tell you that
 
01:55:16.609 --> 01:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
more than one person a significant
 
01:55:18.890 --> 01:55:18.900 align:start position:0%
number of people contact me indicating
 
01:55:22.250 --> 01:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
that they they think this is a fair Bill
 
01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
and that they were treated unfairly with
 
01:55:26.450 --> 01:55:26.460 align:start position:0%
dra to make it clear and crystal clear
 
01:55:28.729 --> 01:55:28.739 align:start position:0%
that dra that compensation shall not be
 
01:55:31.609 --> 01:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
taxes profits thank you for clarifying
 
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
that I just having been here quite a
 
01:55:36.649 --> 01:55:36.659 align:start position:0%
while I'm just surprised that you know
 
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
the business Community isn't here itself
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
but thank you sure
 
01:55:43.310 --> 01:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
all right representative janigan and
 
01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
then we'll go around the room
 
01:55:48.530 --> 01:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:49.490 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
um

01:55:49.490 --> 01:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:52.250 --> 01:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
my concern with this I understand what
 
01:55:54.890 --> 01:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
it's trying to do my concern is I'm not
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
sure it's clear enough
 
01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
as to who it's helping because
 
01:56:03.609 --> 01:56:03.619 align:start position:0%
llc's Partnerships proprietorships
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
LLCs that don't have transferable shares
 
01:56:08.330 --> 01:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
they already can take a compensation
 
01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:09.609 align:start position:0%
they already can take a compensation
deduction

01:56:09.609 --> 01:56:09.619 align:start position:0%
deduction
 
01:56:12.169 --> 01:56:12.179 align:start position:0%
and they also well there's two things
 
01:56:14.209 --> 01:56:14.219 align:start position:0%
they can take a compensation deduction
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
and their distributions are not taxable
 
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
so this almost seems a little too
 
01:56:24.770 --> 01:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
let me also say I ran it by a couple of
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
CPAs both of them were confused as to
 
01:56:28.490 --> 01:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
what this
 
01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
actually was targeting towards so this
 
01:56:33.770 --> 01:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
bill may need to be is the intent here
 
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
to Target it towards s Corps C Corps
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
things that that or or llc's with
 
01:56:42.669 --> 01:56:42.679 align:start position:0%
transferable shares where there would be
 
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
attacks are you familiar with that again
 
01:56:48.169 --> 01:56:48.179 align:start position:0%
so so the idea was that
 
01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
um in with members and owners there
 
01:56:52.669 --> 01:56:52.679 align:start position:0%
there was apparently there were
 
01:56:54.850 --> 01:56:54.860 align:start position:0%
instances where dra was treating
 
01:56:58.189 --> 01:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
disbursements to members and owners as
 
01:57:00.770 --> 01:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
as a disbursement of profit so therefore
 
01:57:03.169 --> 01:57:03.179 align:start position:0%
subject to the business profits tax I
 
01:57:04.370 --> 01:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
don't know how many instances that occur
 
01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
I know again the the comment I got from
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
dra was the word generally which made me
 
01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
nervous because it should be clear that
 
01:57:15.470 --> 01:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
we do or don't tax disbursements as
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
um as profits or as it is it a
 
01:57:19.070 --> 01:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
compensation and not subject to the
 
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
business profits tax so the purpose of
 
01:57:22.689 --> 01:57:22.699 align:start position:0%
this law is to make it crystal clear
 
01:57:25.070 --> 01:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
that a disbursement that's considered
 
01:57:27.169 --> 01:57:27.179 align:start position:0%
reasonable and customary for the
 
01:57:30.770 --> 01:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
industry in considered income and not
 
01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
subject to business profits
 
01:57:33.950 --> 01:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
disbursements and not subject to
 
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
sorry I think I started yeah
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd you were here yeah
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
um this may be have may have already
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
been answered but um are we certain I
 
01:57:50.209 --> 01:57:50.219 align:start position:0%
know you were working with individuals
 
01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
are we certain that this wasn't a
 
01:57:55.010 --> 01:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
payroll processing error in some way
 
01:57:58.330 --> 01:57:58.340 align:start position:0%
shape or form rather than uh an overall
 
01:58:00.890 --> 01:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
arcing issue
 
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
so again I can only I'm going by my
 
01:58:04.850 --> 01:58:04.860 align:start position:0%
response from dra not from the
 
01:58:06.890 --> 01:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
individuals again the response from dras
 
01:58:08.450 --> 01:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
that there are occasions apparently
 
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
there were occasions when disbursements
 
01:58:11.689 --> 01:58:11.699 align:start position:0%
were considered business profits that
 
01:58:13.609 --> 01:58:13.619 align:start position:0%
maybe shouldn't have when they use the
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
word generally right because it should
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
be an absolute no we don't if it's
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable and customary compensation we
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
would never charge business profits tax
 
01:58:21.050 --> 01:58:21.060 align:start position:0%
to that which should have been the
 
01:58:22.850 --> 01:58:22.860 align:start position:0%
answer I was expecting if it wasn't the
 
01:58:26.930 --> 01:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
I just realized I pay all these taxes so
 
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
both of these bills might impact me I
 
01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
don't even know but I should probably
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
mention that representative Platt thank
 
01:58:36.770 --> 01:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question what is
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable compensation sure so again
 
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
dra can use any number of sources to
 
01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
look that up uh I I use it when I had my
 
01:58:45.649 --> 01:58:45.659 align:start position:0%
business and I was looking for
 
01:58:47.209 --> 01:58:47.219 align:start position:0%
compensation for the difference between
 
01:58:48.410 --> 01:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
a network engineer and a network
 
01:58:49.729 --> 01:58:49.739 align:start position:0%
technician what was reasonable
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
compensation so there are plenty of
 
01:58:53.450 --> 01:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
Industries that'll use the I forgot the
 
01:58:55.490 --> 01:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
name there's a business code for almost
 
01:58:56.930 --> 01:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
every job and you can look up what
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable and fair compensation in the
 
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
industry and for your region is using
 
01:59:02.689 --> 01:59:02.699 align:start position:0%
Labor Statistics as well
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
so Department of Labor puts statistics
 
01:59:06.530 --> 01:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
out for those same exact things that'll
 
01:59:08.089 --> 01:59:08.099 align:start position:0%
tell you what the the basic compensation
 
01:59:10.669 --> 01:59:10.679 align:start position:0%
for any given profession is
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative Elber
 
01:59:14.990 --> 01:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm looking at the
 
01:59:20.810 --> 01:59:20.820 align:start position:0%
notes that were distributed by the dra
 
01:59:23.530 --> 01:59:23.540 align:start position:0%
and the last paragraph
 
01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
mentions that the language in the bill
 
01:59:28.129 --> 01:59:28.139 align:start position:0%
does not appear appear to be consistent
 
01:59:30.109 --> 01:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
with the stated intent
 
01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
and the dra would note that there may be
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
risks to businesses if they treat
 
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
payments as in quotes compensation for
 
01:59:38.330 --> 01:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire purposes in order to get
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
the BPT deduction but treat the payments
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
as distribution of earnings for federal
 
01:59:45.530 --> 01:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
purposes can you please comment on that
 
01:59:48.169 --> 01:59:48.179 align:start position:0%
so I don't have your I don't have the
 
01:59:50.450 --> 01:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
notes that they distributed so but I can
 
01:59:53.089 --> 01:59:53.099 align:start position:0%
if the language needs to be clear I
 
01:59:54.770 --> 01:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
think I've been absolutely crystal clear
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
on what I'm trying to accomplish here
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
and what the bill in the Senate and the
 
02:00:02.089 --> 02:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
we did make again to meet dra's requests
 
02:00:03.709 --> 02:00:03.719 align:start position:0%
that idea of the duplicate deduction to
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
make sure it was crystal clear that
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't happen and that was a comment
 
02:00:08.990 --> 02:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and there was another question about
 
02:00:10.490 --> 02:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
constitutionality where we made a minor
 
02:00:11.810 --> 02:00:11.820 align:start position:0%
change that cleaned it up to make it
 
02:00:13.609 --> 02:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
what so it was constitutional I think it
 
02:00:15.770 --> 02:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
had to do with the uh the interest of
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
dividends tax reference is why we
 
02:00:20.089 --> 02:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
cleaned that up it was a mistake it
 
02:00:22.129 --> 02:00:22.139 align:start position:0%
wasn't intended so
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
um again I I think the intent and the
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
language on his face is crystal clear
 
02:00:31.629 --> 02:00:31.639 align:start position:0%
that income given to members and owners
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
that is considered reasonable fare and
 
02:00:36.169 --> 02:00:36.179 align:start position:0%
customary should not be taxed the
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
business profits tax rate and that
 
02:00:41.689 --> 02:00:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative Orris thank you madam
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
chair thank you sir so if I understand
 
02:00:48.890 --> 02:00:48.900 align:start position:0%
this right so if they were charged eight
 
02:00:50.930 --> 02:00:50.940 align:start position:0%
and a half percent the owner and they
 
02:00:52.970 --> 02:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
withdrew a hundred thousand today
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
and they're claiming that as income are
 
02:00:59.390 --> 02:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
they paying taxes as income also as in
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
like in a W-2 if I was getting a W-2
 
02:01:04.430 --> 02:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
when I worked at BAE Systems
 
02:01:06.770 --> 02:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
BAE Systems is covering a lot of those
 
02:01:10.250 --> 02:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
taxes but as an individual employer
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm usually paying a lot more tax
 
02:01:15.229 --> 02:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
usually about 45 cents on the dollar so
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
were they paying both in this case
 
02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question so I guess
 
02:01:22.010 --> 02:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes right again so I
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
owned a bit I had a computer consultancy
 
02:01:25.609 --> 02:01:25.619 align:start position:0%
business with 22 employees that I met
 
02:01:27.950 --> 02:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
and I owned and managed and when I took
 
02:01:29.050 --> 02:01:29.060 align:start position:0%
my draw
 
02:01:32.330 --> 02:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
and my disbursement I did it within the
 
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
within the confines of what is a network
 
02:01:35.689 --> 02:01:35.699 align:start position:0%
engineer makes that's what I was really
 
02:01:37.129 --> 02:01:37.139 align:start position:0%
I was an owner in business but I really
 
02:01:38.330 --> 02:01:38.340 align:start position:0%
just a network engineer with some
 
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
additional duties and so for me yes I I
 
02:01:43.310 --> 02:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
paid when I was left I took that
 
02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
deduction out I didn't get caught in
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
this issue that's going on but I would
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
pay for my draw and my disbursement I
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
would pay federal federal income tax on
 
02:01:55.609 --> 02:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
those wages but in the case of at least
 
02:01:58.250 --> 02:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
a couple instances we know that these
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
other people are paying not only their
 
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
Federal wages because it's income when
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have an income tax they're also
 
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
paying the business profits tax on that
 
02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:07.609 align:start position:0%
paying the business profits tax on that
disbursement

02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
disbursement
 
02:02:07.619 --> 02:02:09.350 align:start position:0%
disbursement
both

02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
02:02:13.729 --> 02:02:13.739 align:start position:0%
if you pay you paid your federal income
 
02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
tax did you also have to pay both sides
 
02:02:20.209 --> 02:02:20.219 align:start position:0%
of your Social Security tax on that
 
02:02:22.129 --> 02:02:22.139 align:start position:0%
as a business owner I'm an answer yes
 
02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
yeah because
 
02:02:27.770 --> 02:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
as an employee of BAE Systems Bae paid
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
half of my Social Security you which is
 
02:02:34.729 --> 02:02:34.739 align:start position:0%
about 15 whatever percent and so as a
 
02:02:37.790 --> 02:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
business owner you paid about 30 percent
 
02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
maybe 31 I forget what the exact number
 
02:02:42.410 --> 02:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
is okay so you paid your federal tax you
 
02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
paid your 31 Social Security and blah
 
02:02:48.169 --> 02:02:48.179 align:start position:0%
blah blah tax and you also ended up
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
paying eight and a half percent on
 
02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
business profits tax so they double
 
02:02:53.570 --> 02:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
dipped you
 
02:02:55.490 --> 02:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
so again I I think that's an accurate
 
02:02:57.169 --> 02:02:57.179 align:start position:0%
statement again as a business owner you
 
02:02:58.490 --> 02:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
end up paying both sides of it and
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's just the nature of it even though
 
02:03:02.209 --> 02:03:02.219 align:start position:0%
it is a there's a veil that's between
 
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
your personal income and your
 
02:03:05.870 --> 02:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
professional income right
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
um but ultimately yes in that instance
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
they would pay both okay so as somebody
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
that's worked in the business all their
 
02:03:15.729 --> 02:03:15.739 align:start position:0%
lives I've owned my own business twice
 
02:03:18.169 --> 02:03:18.179 align:start position:0%
and I've also worked for big
 
02:03:21.169 --> 02:03:21.179 align:start position:0%
corporations it sounds to me like they
 
02:03:23.330 --> 02:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
double dipped you so this this to me
 
02:03:25.370 --> 02:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
sounds very clear that we're
 
02:03:28.129 --> 02:03:28.139 align:start position:0%
this this looks like we ought to pass
 
02:03:30.649 --> 02:03:30.659 align:start position:0%
this in my opinion but that's just based
 
02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
on what I heard today so so again thank
 
02:03:34.970 --> 02:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
you thank you you know my again my
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
opinion is again
 
02:03:37.550 --> 02:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
I wasn't comfortable with the word
 
02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:38.649 align:start position:0%
I wasn't comfortable with the word
generally

02:03:38.649 --> 02:03:38.659 align:start position:0%
generally
 
02:03:41.689 --> 02:03:41.699 align:start position:0%
that Led Led to us some ambiguity and I
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to make it crystal clear that
 
02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
income for owners and members shall not
 
02:03:48.169 --> 02:03:48.179 align:start position:0%
be taxed to business profit sex yes and
 
02:03:50.330 --> 02:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
ambiguity is really difficult to deal
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
with as an accountant or anybody that
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
deals with numbers thinking as expecting
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
dra to say A dollar is a dollar not a
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
sort of a dollar so
 
02:04:01.010 --> 02:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
keep in mind this is a public hearing
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
and we are asking clarifying questions
 
02:04:05.689 --> 02:04:05.699 align:start position:0%
of the bill sponsor saw some hands over
 
02:04:07.729 --> 02:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
here anyone have question representative
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:13.129 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:04:13.129 --> 02:04:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:16.370 --> 02:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
fair and reasonable compensation
 
02:04:20.169 --> 02:04:20.179 align:start position:0%
means in at this point it means
 
02:04:23.629 --> 02:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
compensation for professional work or
 
02:04:26.330 --> 02:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
manual work cleaning the toilets
 
02:04:29.689 --> 02:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
whatever you did in your business
 
02:04:29.699 --> 02:04:31.669 align:start position:0%
whatever you did in your business
on

02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:04:35.570 --> 02:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
it does not mean anything you decide to
 
02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:43.729 --> 02:04:43.739 align:start position:0%
now what you're doing is saying any um
 
02:04:47.870 --> 02:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
the people that set all of this up back
 
02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
in the days when only Republicans were
 
02:04:53.390 --> 02:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
writing the law on
 
02:04:58.010 --> 02:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
did not want us to allow the lawyers and
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
the doctors and others dentists to
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:12.830 --> 02:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
to take all of their the revenue of
 
02:05:17.169 --> 02:05:17.179 align:start position:0%
their business as a business expense
 
02:05:21.229 --> 02:05:21.239 align:start position:0%
that could be deducted so that they were
 
02:05:23.930 --> 02:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
paying no taxes whatsoever
 
02:05:30.050 --> 02:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
Benson actually created by when he was
 
02:05:37.850 --> 02:05:37.860 align:start position:0%
head of of his his company on
 
02:05:41.870 --> 02:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
suing the state because only the big
 
02:05:45.410 --> 02:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
businesses were having to pay the
 
02:05:47.390 --> 02:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
business profits tax that have been put
 
02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:48.350 align:start position:0%
business profits tax that have been put
in

02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:57.410 --> 02:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
are we at a point where we can just
 
02:06:01.310 --> 02:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
decide that all Professionals in and
 
02:06:05.270 --> 02:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
owners of llc's are going to be able to
 
02:06:07.250 --> 02:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
avoid paying taxes
 
02:06:10.250 --> 02:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
and if we are are we going to go back to
 
02:06:14.089 --> 02:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
another lawsuit from some big company
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
taking up what Benson Benson did because
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
they fixed the law that way the lawsuit
 
02:06:25.010 --> 02:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:26.689 --> 02:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question again I
 
02:06:28.669 --> 02:06:28.679 align:start position:0%
can only answer that fair and reasonable
 
02:06:30.290 --> 02:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
compensation never be should never be
 
02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
taxed at the business profits tax rate
 
02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
in any situation so if if again using
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
whether it's the labor codes that they
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
use for given Industries and for given
 
02:06:41.390 --> 02:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh job functions whether you're using
 
02:06:43.310 --> 02:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
that as a measure of fair and reasonable
 
02:06:44.810 --> 02:06:44.820 align:start position:0%
compensation anything that's above and
 
02:06:46.850 --> 02:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
beyond that maybe fair game for subject
 
02:06:48.890 --> 02:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
to business profits tax but anything
 
02:06:50.930 --> 02:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
below that that's reasonable and
 
02:06:52.729 --> 02:06:52.739 align:start position:0%
justifiable as as reasonable
 
02:06:55.310 --> 02:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
compensation through a draw and and
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
disbursement should not be taxed at the
 
02:07:01.010 --> 02:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
business profits tax rate
 
02:07:01.020 --> 02:07:02.450 align:start position:0%
business profits tax rate
okay

02:07:02.450 --> 02:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:07:06.050 --> 02:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
follow-up can you believe that Mike
 
02:07:11.570 --> 02:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
sorry uh you believe that Romans 3 does
 
02:07:14.570 --> 02:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
not adequately cover that
 
02:07:16.850 --> 02:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
I guess my answer is if Roman 3 adequate
 
02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
covered I wouldn't got the word
 
02:07:25.370 --> 02:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:25.380 --> 02:07:26.750 align:start position:0%
 
Ames

02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
Ames
 
02:07:29.209 --> 02:07:29.219 align:start position:0%
yeah just following up following up on
 
02:07:30.530 --> 02:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
that discussion
 
02:07:34.070 --> 02:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
um I think what I'm hearing is that
 
02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:37.250 align:start position:0%
um I think what I'm hearing is that
um

02:07:37.250 --> 02:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:39.649 --> 02:07:39.659 align:start position:0%
that the issue you're trying to address
 
02:07:39.659 --> 02:07:42.050 align:start position:0%
that the issue you're trying to address
is

02:07:42.050 --> 02:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:07:42.060 --> 02:07:43.070 align:start position:0%
is
um

02:07:43.070 --> 02:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:45.589 align:start position:0%
um
a

02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:07:48.649 --> 02:07:48.659 align:start position:0%
arguable ambiguity in the just a
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable compensation
 
02:07:53.290 --> 02:07:53.300 align:start position:0%
provision that's already in the tax code
 
02:07:58.250 --> 02:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
and your perception based on
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
and admittedly uh limited inquiry on
 
02:08:03.970 --> 02:08:03.980 align:start position:0%
your part
 
02:08:08.030 --> 02:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
is that some distributions
 
02:08:11.450 --> 02:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
to owners
 
02:08:13.810 --> 02:08:13.820 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:08:17.209 --> 02:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
rejected as reasonable compensation so
 
02:08:21.290 --> 02:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
they then become taxable as a profit and
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
if if that's what we're dealing with
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
here I think you know for me I need to
 
02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
hear more from gra about the scope of
 
02:08:32.750 --> 02:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
the just and reasonable compensation
 
02:08:34.609 --> 02:08:34.619 align:start position:0%
Clause it seems to me it's a very
 
02:08:36.290 --> 02:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
appropriate division
 
02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:38.209 align:start position:0%
appropriate division
to

02:08:38.209 --> 02:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:08:38.219 --> 02:08:38.950 align:start position:0%
to
um

02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
effectively exempt from the private tax
 
02:08:46.189 --> 02:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
the reasonable fair and reasonable
 
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
compensation received by owners
 
02:08:52.930 --> 02:08:52.940 align:start position:0%
which may indeed
 
02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
take place at the end of the year as a
 
02:08:59.290 --> 02:08:59.300 align:start position:0%
bonus that's related to Services
 
02:09:02.169 --> 02:09:02.179 align:start position:0%
performed by the owner
 
02:09:06.649 --> 02:09:06.659 align:start position:0%
and if uh if that is and then that's
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's an appropriate dividing line
 
02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:10.990 align:start position:0%
that's an appropriate dividing line
between

02:09:10.990 --> 02:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.830 align:start position:0%
between
compensation

02:09:12.830 --> 02:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
02:09:15.890 --> 02:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
which is deductible and not subject to
 
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
an income tax here in New Hampshire
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
and on the other side the business
 
02:09:26.270 --> 02:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
profits that are taxable and um
 
02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:27.589 align:start position:0%
profits that are taxable and um
so

02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
it's to me uh intellectually it's an
 
02:09:35.149 --> 02:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate division of Concepts and a
 
02:09:37.010 --> 02:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
place to have the tax and not have the
 
02:09:40.129 --> 02:09:40.139 align:start position:0%
tax and we need to look closely at what
 
02:09:42.350 --> 02:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
is actually happening make sure that
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
there isn't some
 
02:09:46.209 --> 02:09:46.219 align:start position:0%
some movement in the wrong direction
 
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
I'm really afraid that this proposal
 
02:09:51.770 --> 02:09:51.780 align:start position:0%
opens up a whole new
 
02:09:51.780 --> 02:09:53.350 align:start position:0%
opens up a whole new
category

02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
category
 
02:09:56.930 --> 02:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
that creeps into the profit side of the
 
02:09:59.629 --> 02:09:59.639 align:start position:0%
business and that's what we don't want
 
02:10:02.330 --> 02:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
to do I think so I don't know you might
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
comment on that uh what I just said
 
02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
so again I I think we're we're
 
02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
conceptually on the same path right we
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
agree that fair reasonable compensation
 
02:10:15.770 --> 02:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
should not be taxed at a business
 
02:10:17.390 --> 02:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
profits tax rate
 
02:10:19.490 --> 02:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
but the determination of what is and
 
02:10:22.070 --> 02:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
apparently that is in question at dra
 
02:10:23.870 --> 02:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
and so therefore I felt this bill
 
02:10:25.850 --> 02:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
brought being brought forward made it
 
02:10:28.490 --> 02:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
crystal clear that um and it and Beyond
 
02:10:30.770 --> 02:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
and to the other thing I also look at
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
this bill as giving some protections to
 
02:10:35.810 --> 02:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
a taxpayer right so it gives if an owner
 
02:10:37.370 --> 02:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
is charged at eight and a half percent
 
02:10:39.470 --> 02:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
they can point to this law point to the
 
02:10:41.169 --> 02:10:41.179 align:start position:0%
Labor Statistics or whatever
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
model they use you know dun and
 
02:10:45.589 --> 02:10:45.599 align:start position:0%
Bradstreet whatever they want to use for
 
02:10:47.570 --> 02:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
showing what a reasonable and fair
 
02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
compensation package is and why they
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't this law gives that taxpayer
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
the consumer protections to do that
 
02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
their taxpayer protections to do that by
 
02:10:56.689 --> 02:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
saying under this chapter I'm entitled
 
02:10:59.390 --> 02:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
to fair and reasonable compensation
 
02:11:02.209 --> 02:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
um and here's how I justify that
 
02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
compensation and gives them a leg to go
 
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
to dra and at least challenge the ruling
 
02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:11.830 align:start position:0%
to dra and at least challenge the ruling
okay

02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:14.030 --> 02:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
let's just try to make sure we're asking
 
02:11:16.070 --> 02:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
questions and not trying to debate this
 
02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
topic with the sponsor representative
 
02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
orrs thank you madam chair
 
02:11:24.890 --> 02:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
so I I enjoyed rep armies and rep Ames
 
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
narrative and I think the confusion is
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
and the camp the compensation part what
 
02:11:33.709 --> 02:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
what you're actually drawing out of the
 
02:11:35.629 --> 02:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
business so let me ask the question in
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
terms of how would you
 
02:11:40.970 --> 02:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
get paid or how would you enjoy the
 
02:11:43.550 --> 02:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
fruits of your labor in your business if
 
02:11:49.310 --> 02:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:51.709 --> 02:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
so I'm not quite sure
 
02:11:54.050 --> 02:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
how to answer that question because I'm
 
02:11:55.370 --> 02:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
not sure I understand it but I will tell
 
02:11:57.050 --> 02:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
you let me let me rephrase that question
 
02:11:59.689 --> 02:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
so you're working along and let's say
 
02:12:01.129 --> 02:12:01.139 align:start position:0%
you you're going to draw your
 
02:12:03.649 --> 02:12:03.659 align:start position:0%
compensation once a year based on how
 
02:12:06.589 --> 02:12:06.599 align:start position:0%
well your business does so maybe one
 
02:12:08.930 --> 02:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
year you decide that
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
I've paid my employees fifty thousand
 
02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:12.830 align:start position:0%
I've paid my employees fifty thousand
dollars

02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
whether the business was doing well or
 
02:12:17.149 --> 02:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
not well why don't we stay a hundred
 
02:12:18.530 --> 02:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars we'll just stay with a
 
02:12:20.570 --> 02:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars but you see the
 
02:12:23.209 --> 02:12:23.219 align:start position:0%
businesses not doing so well so maybe
 
02:12:25.370 --> 02:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
you draw less than a hundred thousand
 
02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
because you need to keep cash and
 
02:12:29.089 --> 02:12:29.099 align:start position:0%
whatever in the business
 
02:12:32.089 --> 02:12:32.099 align:start position:0%
so if you drew only fifty thousand
 
02:12:34.490 --> 02:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
dollars at the end of one year the
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
second year the business is doing great
 
02:12:38.030 --> 02:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
the employees still got paid to say
 
02:12:39.770 --> 02:12:39.780 align:start position:0%
maybe they got a wage increase but they
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
still got paid about a hundred thousand
 
02:12:44.510 --> 02:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
now your your business is doing very
 
02:12:47.089 --> 02:12:47.099 align:start position:0%
well you only Drew fifty thousand last
 
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
year so if you Drew Drew 125
 
02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:51.229 align:start position:0%
year so if you Drew Drew 125
000

02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
000
 
02:12:53.270 --> 02:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
the second year at the end of the second
 
02:12:55.609 --> 02:12:55.619 align:start position:0%
year that would to me seem reasonable
 
02:12:55.619 --> 02:12:57.050 align:start position:0%
year that would to me seem reasonable
compensation

02:12:57.050 --> 02:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
if you didn't draw the 125 000 how else
 
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
would you have put a money in your
 
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
pocket to pay your bills so does that
 
02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
help yeah it does but you probably like
 
02:13:08.810 --> 02:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
fancy because I don't I don't think it's
 
02:13:11.330 --> 02:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
reasonable right again as a business
 
02:13:12.890 --> 02:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
owner I've done that right so I own my
 
02:13:14.810 --> 02:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
business for 12 years and they were they
 
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
were in 2008 was a really rough year to
 
02:13:17.930 --> 02:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
own a business
 
02:13:20.930 --> 02:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
um and so in 2008 I lowered my
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
compensations I could make sure I could
 
02:13:24.589 --> 02:13:24.599 align:start position:0%
take care of my employees that I had to
 
02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that I had money to pay their
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know I paid 100 of the insurance I
 
02:13:30.169 --> 02:13:30.179 align:start position:0%
paid you know a lot of things that
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
tracked employees and to keep employees
 
02:13:33.890 --> 02:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:13:37.250 --> 02:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
um I I I took that however in the second
 
02:13:39.229 --> 02:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
year if I was to say well I'm going to
 
02:13:41.629 --> 02:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
make up the what I lost last year I
 
02:13:43.129 --> 02:13:43.139 align:start position:0%
would honestly classify that as a bonus
 
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
a bonus uh disbursement and I I mean I'm
 
02:13:48.169 --> 02:13:48.179 align:start position:0%
not a bonuses person but a disbursement
 
02:13:49.790 --> 02:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
of profits and I'd be subject to
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
business profits tax yeah that's my
 
02:13:53.450 --> 02:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
that's my belief that's the way I would
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
treat it and that's the way I did treat
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
it when I owned my business well uh
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
follow follow up so I'm I'm surprised to
 
02:14:03.890 --> 02:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
actually hear that so I mean in my mind
 
02:14:06.290 --> 02:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
it's like I'm trying to equalize my
 
02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
salary over a number of years and just
 
02:14:10.970 --> 02:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
not one year but okay so if it was the
 
02:14:12.890 --> 02:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
second year was only a hundred thousand
 
02:14:15.649 --> 02:14:15.659 align:start position:0%
again you need to draw money at some
 
02:14:17.810 --> 02:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
point to pay your your personal bills
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
Etc right so that's basically your
 
02:14:23.689 --> 02:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
income is that correct correct thank you
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay we're just going to go around the
 
02:14:26.450 --> 02:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
room this way again representative
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you madam chair thank you
 
02:14:32.930 --> 02:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm looking at um
 
02:14:38.330 --> 02:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
the text in here under uh XX
 
02:14:40.250 --> 02:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
it talks about
 
02:14:43.069 --> 02:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
uh compensation for members and owners
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
now I know who employees are I know who
 
02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
owners are
 
02:14:49.550 --> 02:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know who members are and I'm
 
02:14:52.490 --> 02:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
curious as to number one what are they
 
02:14:55.069 --> 02:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
and number two what might they be
 
02:14:58.850 --> 02:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
contributing to uh lead to them getting
 
02:15:01.069 --> 02:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
some kind of compensation thank you so
 
02:15:02.270 --> 02:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
that's the difference between the forms
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
of of Corporations the way you set up
 
02:15:06.410 --> 02:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
your NLC has members
 
02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:08.569 align:start position:0%
your NLC has members
so

02:15:08.569 --> 02:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:11.089 --> 02:15:11.099 align:start position:0%
okay so follow up
 
02:15:11.099 --> 02:15:12.410 align:start position:0%
okay so follow up
so

02:15:12.410 --> 02:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:14.270 --> 02:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
which is the equivalent of an owner just
 
02:15:18.830 --> 02:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh so just a funny as they use in an LLC
 
02:15:20.330 --> 02:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
the members
 
02:15:23.930 --> 02:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
are in effect the owners thank you
 
02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
okay going around the room
 
02:15:31.850 --> 02:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:34.609 --> 02:15:34.619 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham sorry uh uh
 
02:15:36.649 --> 02:15:36.659 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh just
 
02:15:38.569 --> 02:15:38.579 align:start position:0%
follow up on the other thing is is there
 
02:15:40.609 --> 02:15:40.619 align:start position:0%
any reason a member of an LLC can't get
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
a 1099 or a W-2 for whatever their their
 
02:15:47.149 --> 02:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh fair and reasonable uh distribution
 
02:15:49.970 --> 02:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
or compensation is for the company and
 
02:15:53.330 --> 02:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be deductible thank you
 
02:15:54.830 --> 02:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest I don't know the answer
 
02:15:56.089 --> 02:15:56.099 align:start position:0%
that question I wouldn't want to
 
02:15:56.099 --> 02:15:59.330 align:start position:0%
that question I wouldn't want to
speculate

02:15:59.330 --> 02:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.340 --> 02:16:01.850 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:16:01.850 --> 02:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:16:04.490 --> 02:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you so much
 
02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh the only other pink cards I have are
 
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
from the dra I don't have anyone else on
 
02:16:10.669 --> 02:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
the is there anyone else here who wants
 
02:16:14.689 --> 02:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
to speak on the bill okay uh keen and uh
 
02:16:16.850 --> 02:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
Fred do you want to come up and
 
02:16:26.169 --> 02:16:26.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:28.970 --> 02:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
good morning Fred cool broth again
 
02:16:32.330 --> 02:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
director of audit New Hampshire dra
 
02:16:35.929 --> 02:16:35.939 align:start position:0%
Kim text policy Council of dra and it's
 
02:16:38.330 --> 02:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
probably appropriate
 
02:16:39.950 --> 02:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
um first for me to start off by
 
02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
apologizing to Senator Lang because
 
02:16:45.650 --> 02:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
um in uh
 
02:16:48.650 --> 02:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
over at dra were a bunch of tax lawyers
 
02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
and accountants and tax experts and we
 
02:16:56.929 --> 02:16:56.939 align:start position:0%
have the admitted failing of overly
 
02:17:01.570 --> 02:17:01.580 align:start position:0%
relying on the word generally absolutely
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
the world of tax policy is super
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
complicated I know it comes across that
 
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
way to you all and believe me it comes
 
02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
across that way to us as well and so we
 
02:17:16.310 --> 02:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
have almost a reflexive deferential use
 
02:17:18.410 --> 02:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
of the word generally when maybe it's
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
not always appropriate so
 
02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:21.709 align:start position:0%
not always appropriate so
um

02:17:21.709 --> 02:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's probably helpful to start this
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
conversation with uh
 
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
yes to answer Senator Lang it is it is
 
02:17:35.150 --> 02:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
crystal clear that if
 
02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:36.370 align:start position:0%
crystal clear that if
um

02:17:36.370 --> 02:17:36.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:40.009 --> 02:17:40.019 align:start position:0%
compensation is paid by a business
 
02:17:40.019 --> 02:17:41.709 align:start position:0%
compensation is paid by a business
organization

02:17:41.709 --> 02:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
organization
 
02:17:45.650 --> 02:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
to an owner of any kind of entity
 
02:17:47.629 --> 02:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:17:47.639 --> 02:17:49.310 align:start position:0%
that is
reasonable

02:17:49.310 --> 02:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:17:53.450 --> 02:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:56.030 --> 02:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
to it to a natural person you can't pay
 
02:17:59.389 --> 02:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
you know if you can't re-characterize an
 
02:18:00.889 --> 02:18:00.899 align:start position:0%
expense that you're paying to a company
 
02:18:02.589 --> 02:18:02.599 align:start position:0%
as compensation
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
and under this section and consistent
 
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
with Section 162 of the federal
 
02:18:10.669 --> 02:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code
 
02:18:14.750 --> 02:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
yes it is crystal clear that is 100
 
02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:18.230 align:start position:0%
yes it is crystal clear that is 100
deductible

02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:20.629 --> 02:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
it's also probably noteworthy to point
 
02:18:22.849 --> 02:18:22.859 align:start position:0%
out that um
 
02:18:22.859 --> 02:18:25.250 align:start position:0%
out that um
the

02:18:25.250 --> 02:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:29.810 --> 02:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
the history surrounding this deduction
 
02:18:32.570 --> 02:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
and what was permissible and what was
 
02:18:34.669 --> 02:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
not permissible in recent years really
 
02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
02:18:39.770 --> 02:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
the determination as to what is
 
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable compensation what is not and
 
02:18:45.410 --> 02:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
that led to the
 
02:18:48.589 --> 02:18:48.599 align:start position:0%
um the audits that generated some
 
02:18:52.610 --> 02:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
notoriety over at the legislature uh 10
 
02:18:55.610 --> 02:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
or 15 years ago and which resulted in
 
02:18:55.620 --> 02:18:57.250 align:start position:0%
or 15 years ago and which resulted in
the

02:18:57.250 --> 02:18:57.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:00.290 --> 02:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
the burden shifting to the department
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
now so under existing law as as the
 
02:19:08.690 --> 02:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
deduction is currently drafted uh me and
 
02:19:10.910 --> 02:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
my team have the bear the burden of
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
proving that compensation is
 
02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:14.509 align:start position:0%
proving that compensation is
unreasonable

02:19:14.509 --> 02:19:14.519 align:start position:0%
unreasonable
 
02:19:16.910 --> 02:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to get up here and tell
 
02:19:18.410 --> 02:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
you all that I think we're getting that
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
right now because that would seem really
 
02:19:22.969 --> 02:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
self-serving but I think the fact that
 
02:19:24.889 --> 02:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
you know for the most part folks are not
 
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
coming up to testify as to whether or
 
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
not the dra and the audit division is
 
02:19:34.310 --> 02:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
overly aggressive on the determination
 
02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
are reasonable I think that
 
02:19:38.690 --> 02:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
can hopefully speak for itself that
 
02:19:40.969 --> 02:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
um the the way that this the deduction
 
02:19:42.969 --> 02:19:42.979 align:start position:0%
currently works
 
02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are General there see there I
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
go again taxpayers are able to deduct
 
02:19:52.730 --> 02:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
compensation when it's reasonable and
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
again I don't want to say I don't want
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
to come up here and appear self-serving
 
02:19:58.250 --> 02:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
but that's not what's generated the
 
02:19:59.750 --> 02:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
dispute today and I I don't want to
 
02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to speak for
 
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang but I've not heard that
 
02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:04.130 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang but I've not heard that
today

02:20:04.130 --> 02:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
um the issues that do come up under
 
02:20:09.889 --> 02:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
audit are these types of situations
 
02:20:12.969 --> 02:20:12.979 align:start position:0%
where a company is
 
02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
re-characterizing a payment to another
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
company as compensation but it's not or
 
02:20:21.410 --> 02:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
um or as would be the case when they've
 
02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
made a profit distribution that's not
 
02:20:27.050 --> 02:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
paid not paid for services
 
02:20:28.730 --> 02:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
but they want to deduct it as
 
02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
compensation if it's not if it's not a
 
02:20:32.700 --> 02:20:33.790 align:start position:0%
compensation if it's not if it's not a
distribution

02:20:33.790 --> 02:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
02:20:37.570 --> 02:20:37.580 align:start position:0%
in exchange for services provided by
 
02:20:41.389 --> 02:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
that employee that owner employee to the
 
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
company then it's not deductible
 
02:20:47.050 --> 02:20:47.060 align:start position:0%
but certainly uh the owner of a company
 
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
who pays herself pays himself
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh let's say a sort of Baseline salary
 
02:20:59.450 --> 02:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
and then pays themselves a quarterly or
 
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
end of year bonus
 
02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
those are for South if that's if that if
 
02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
that bonus
 
02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:07.849 align:start position:0%
that bonus
is

02:21:07.849 --> 02:21:07.859 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
for services
 
02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to be deductible
 
02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:13.790 align:start position:0%
it's going to be deductible
uh

02:21:13.790 --> 02:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
again it's it's not in those limited
 
02:21:17.929 --> 02:21:17.939 align:start position:0%
situations where they're trying to
 
02:21:19.969 --> 02:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
re-characterize something else as comp
 
02:21:22.309 --> 02:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
but but it's not
 
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
um and the I forget who who was asking
 
02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
about the note that we said that we made
 
02:21:29.389 --> 02:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
in our
 
02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh in our deliverable to you all noting
 
02:21:33.530 --> 02:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
that there could be some potential
 
02:21:35.929 --> 02:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
Federal consequences yeah you you
 
02:21:38.090 --> 02:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
certainly don't in your IRS audit you
 
02:21:39.290 --> 02:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want it to come out in
 
02:21:41.330 --> 02:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
front of the IRS auditor that you're
 
02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
characterizing things for New Hampshire
 
02:21:44.929 --> 02:21:44.939 align:start position:0%
one way in the in the feds another way
 
02:21:47.210 --> 02:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
the IRS Auditors are not going to look
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
kindly on that that's sort of a tangent
 
02:21:51.170 --> 02:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
but just
 
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
um and then to
 
02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:53.690 align:start position:0%
um and then to
um

02:21:53.690 --> 02:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
in further comment to
 
02:22:01.070 --> 02:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Orr's on um
 
02:22:04.250 --> 02:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh this notion of if you're if your
 
02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:05.590 align:start position:0%
uh this notion of if you're if your
company

02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
company
 
02:22:08.330 --> 02:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
underperforms in one year so you have to
 
02:22:11.150 --> 02:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
give yourself a salary cut in one year
 
02:22:13.610 --> 02:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
because you just don't have cash you
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
don't have cash on hand at the end of
 
02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
the year or whenever you're making your
 
02:22:20.510 --> 02:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
bonus distribution uh and so you you
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
take a pay cut
 
02:22:24.410 --> 02:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely deduct you pay
 
02:22:26.929 --> 02:22:26.939 align:start position:0%
yourself that in the next year so-called
 
02:22:29.630 --> 02:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
catch-up comp that is deductible in the
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
next year that Crystal Clear
 
02:22:35.450 --> 02:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
um again that the way that comes in to
 
02:22:36.889 --> 02:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
the deduction
 
02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
is through the reference in the existing
 
02:22:43.370 --> 02:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
deduction to section 162 of the federal
 
02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
code and the case law that exists under
 
02:22:50.270 --> 02:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
that deduction and if you look at the
 
02:22:52.130 --> 02:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
deduct if you look at the the case law
 
02:22:54.830 --> 02:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
surrounding that deduction and as it
 
02:22:56.450 --> 02:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
exists in the first circuit which is
 
02:22:59.090 --> 02:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
what would be the circle applicable to
 
02:23:00.110 --> 02:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:23:02.630 --> 02:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
that is allowable and so we would we
 
02:23:04.730 --> 02:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
would respect that and we would have to
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
because that is the law
 
02:23:09.469 --> 02:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to clarify that
 
02:23:12.050 --> 02:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
um there's some sort of
 
02:23:13.969 --> 02:23:13.979 align:start position:0%
wonky issue as to if it's sort of
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable either way it doesn't really
 
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
matter because if it's still reasonable
 
02:23:18.889 --> 02:23:18.899 align:start position:0%
you don't even have to make the catch-up
 
02:23:21.290 --> 02:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
comp argument but certainly if there
 
02:23:24.650 --> 02:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
were uh you know some concern then it
 
02:23:25.730 --> 02:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter because it's still
 
02:23:28.429 --> 02:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
ketchup comp and yeah you're allowed to
 
02:23:30.170 --> 02:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
make yourself whole again in bad years
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's that is the state of the law so
 
02:23:35.570 --> 02:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
again to the extent this has sort of
 
02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
spun off of
 
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
our reflexive
 
02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
overuse of the word generally I totally
 
02:23:43.130 --> 02:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
understand where Senator Lang is coming
 
02:23:46.130 --> 02:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
from on that again this stuff is so
 
02:23:48.530 --> 02:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
complicated that even sometimes the
 
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
folks like us who who are dealing with
 
02:23:52.910 --> 02:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
it all the time even sometimes we get
 
02:23:54.889 --> 02:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
Squishy on it and that's that's not
 
02:23:56.870 --> 02:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
exactly a service to anybody uh so I
 
02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:58.309 align:start position:0%
exactly a service to anybody uh so I
apologize

02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
02:24:00.170 --> 02:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
um but again
 
02:24:03.290 --> 02:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
within the existing deduction if if
 
02:24:09.050 --> 02:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
an employee owner of any entity is paid
 
02:24:12.349 --> 02:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
compensation for services that are
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable under Section 162 with the
 
02:24:17.090 --> 02:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
benefit on their side on on their side
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
It's deductible
 
02:24:21.650 --> 02:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative Platt
 
02:24:23.570 --> 02:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question are you
 
02:24:26.210 --> 02:24:26.220 align:start position:0%
saying then that uh this bill is not
 
02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:27.830 align:start position:0%
saying then that uh this bill is not
necessary

02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:24:29.270 --> 02:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:30.590 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:31.270 align:start position:0%
representative
um

02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:34.730 --> 02:24:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:35.990 --> 02:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
right right
 
02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.070 align:start position:0%
right right
um

02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
if if that's all it's seeking to do in
 
02:24:43.730 --> 02:24:43.740 align:start position:0%
in my view and I I honest in in the
 
02:24:45.349 --> 02:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
Department's view
 
02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
um it's duplicative it's it's redundant
 
02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:48.770 align:start position:0%
um it's duplicative it's it's redundant
um

02:24:48.770 --> 02:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
if it's seeking to do something else I I
 
02:24:53.330 --> 02:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
don't know what that would be I'm happy
 
02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
to work with with Senator Lang or any of
 
02:24:59.630 --> 02:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
you to if if there is a perceived
 
02:25:01.790 --> 02:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh Gap
 
02:25:03.889 --> 02:25:03.899 align:start position:0%
we're happy to to work with folks and to
 
02:25:05.570 --> 02:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
close that Gap you know to help you
 
02:25:07.730 --> 02:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
draft language that would close that
 
02:25:09.290 --> 02:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
um we're happy to work with whoever
 
02:25:11.150 --> 02:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
wants to follow up does the bill do any
 
02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:12.230 align:start position:0%
wants to follow up does the bill do any
harm

02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
harm
 
02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:13.910 align:start position:0%
harm
so

02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:16.969 --> 02:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
to the extent it creates confusion
 
02:25:16.979 --> 02:25:18.230 align:start position:0%
to the extent it creates confusion
um

02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:21.290 --> 02:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
potentially so if
 
02:25:23.270 --> 02:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
if tax if taxpayers only use it
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
essentially as a second you know they
 
02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
get to choose between
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
deducting under Roman 3 or this other
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
line on the return
 
02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
no it doesn't do any harm it's it's
 
02:25:38.570 --> 02:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
redundant uh
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
it there's no potential Revenue impact
 
02:25:45.710 --> 02:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
um it's it's just an alternative means
 
02:25:48.770 --> 02:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
to deduct what they could already deduct
 
02:25:52.670 --> 02:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
if it somehow signals to folks that
 
02:25:55.010 --> 02:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
something else is permitted that wasn't
 
02:25:56.750 --> 02:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
previously permitted
 
02:25:58.610 --> 02:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
then it could potentially do harm I
 
02:26:00.290 --> 02:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
don't know how we quantify that I don't
 
02:26:01.610 --> 02:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
know how we determine what that would be
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
that would be my main concern is
 
02:26:08.330 --> 02:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
what what folks would view that line or
 
02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
what that what folks would view that
 
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
me we'll go back around the room
 
02:26:22.969 --> 02:26:22.979 align:start position:0%
thank you so if we passed this and we
 
02:26:25.990 --> 02:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
had Romans 3 which everyone's used to
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
and we uh now had Roman 15.
 
02:26:36.469 --> 02:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
you would have to write rules that
 
02:26:36.479 --> 02:26:39.170 align:start position:0%
you would have to write rules that
explain

02:26:39.170 --> 02:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:43.010 --> 02:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
what customary means and how this is
 
02:26:45.950 --> 02:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
different from fair and reasonable
 
02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative all me uh
 
02:26:52.790 --> 02:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
yes I believe I believe that's correct
 
02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:53.690 align:start position:0%
yes I believe I believe that's correct
um

02:26:53.690 --> 02:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
have you got any idea what that would
 
02:26:56.399 --> 02:26:57.650 align:start position:0%
have you got any idea what that would
imply

02:26:57.650 --> 02:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
imply
 
02:26:57.660 --> 02:27:00.349 align:start position:0%
imply
so

02:27:00.349 --> 02:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:03.710 --> 02:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
not not as of yet that
 
02:27:05.809 --> 02:27:05.819 align:start position:0%
that's a complicated question
 
02:27:05.819 --> 02:27:07.910 align:start position:0%
that's a complicated question
um

02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:11.570 --> 02:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
there's there's probably significant
 
02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:15.170 align:start position:0%
there's there's probably significant
overlap

02:27:15.170 --> 02:27:15.180 align:start position:0%
overlap
 
02:27:19.849 --> 02:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
with that term and what already exists
 
02:27:22.370 --> 02:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
under the existing
 
02:27:25.969 --> 02:27:25.979 align:start position:0%
federal case law that interprets 162 and
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
that we're required to use
 
02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:30.469 align:start position:0%
that we're required to use
so

02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:35.510 --> 02:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
it may not be all that different or any
 
02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
different as a practical matter but I
 
02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:38.990 align:start position:0%
different as a practical matter but I
think

02:27:38.990 --> 02:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:27:42.110 --> 02:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
by introducing the term I think dra
 
02:27:44.750 --> 02:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
would likely need to Draft rules to
 
02:27:47.270 --> 02:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
further clarify that whatever Federal
 
02:27:50.750 --> 02:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
definition it has in the case law that
 
02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
that's what we would be using because
 
02:28:01.389 --> 02:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:07.070 --> 02:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and if it what I'm hearing is
 
02:28:12.230 --> 02:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
that any disbursement to a member owner
 
02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:13.730 align:start position:0%
that any disbursement to a member owner
is

02:28:13.730 --> 02:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:28:17.389 --> 02:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
reason is customary
 
02:28:21.050 --> 02:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
or fair fair reasonable and customary
 
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
on if
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
that on
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
interpretation held
 
02:28:32.110 --> 02:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't all Partnerships and
 
02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:46.849 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:28:46.849 --> 02:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:49.130 --> 02:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
again that that that's a complicated
 
02:28:49.140 --> 02:28:50.450 align:start position:0%
again that that that's a complicated
question

02:28:50.450 --> 02:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:28:50.460 --> 02:28:51.290 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:28:51.290 --> 02:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:53.330 --> 02:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
and this it
 
02:28:55.309 --> 02:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:28:58.550 --> 02:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
relates back to the point you made about
 
02:28:58.560 --> 02:28:59.330 align:start position:0%
relates back to the point you made about
um

02:28:59.330 --> 02:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh the history of the business profits
 
02:29:02.809 --> 02:29:02.819 align:start position:0%
tax and why we have the business
 
02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax because the business
 
02:29:06.469 --> 02:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax does exist as a
 
02:29:06.479 --> 02:29:07.670 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax does exist as a
counterbalance

02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
counterbalance
 
02:29:10.010 --> 02:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
frankly for this deduction
 
02:29:10.020 --> 02:29:12.469 align:start position:0%
frankly for this deduction
um

02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:14.510 --> 02:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
I mean it is
 
02:29:17.330 --> 02:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
often the case that
 
02:29:21.170 --> 02:29:21.180 align:start position:0%
smaller companies regardless of how
 
02:29:22.610 --> 02:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
they're structured regardless of whether
 
02:29:27.050 --> 02:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
it's an LLC or corporation that has
 
02:29:28.969 --> 02:29:28.979 align:start position:0%
elected S Corp status federally or
 
02:29:28.979 --> 02:29:30.290 align:start position:0%
elected S Corp status federally or
whatever

02:29:30.290 --> 02:29:30.300 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:29:32.510 --> 02:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
it is often the case
 
02:29:34.849 --> 02:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
that they don't have taxable business
 
02:29:37.030 --> 02:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
profits because
 
02:29:40.610 --> 02:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
they have to employ whether they're
 
02:29:43.370 --> 02:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
owners or just regular employees they
 
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
have to employ
 
02:29:48.530 --> 02:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
very expensive labor they have to hire
 
02:29:48.540 --> 02:29:50.630 align:start position:0%
very expensive labor they have to hire
lawyers

02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
lawyers
 
02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:52.429 align:start position:0%
lawyers
dentists

02:29:52.429 --> 02:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
dentists
 
02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
doctors whatever the practice is
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
whatever the firm or businesses if they
 
02:30:00.110 --> 02:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
have expensive employees who ultimately
 
02:30:02.929 --> 02:30:02.939 align:start position:0%
become owners
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
they have to pay those people at market
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
and that might mean there's not a whole
 
02:30:09.410 --> 02:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
lot if any in the term of in terms of
 
02:30:12.349 --> 02:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
taxable business profits
 
02:30:15.170 --> 02:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
but there there are certainly there are
 
02:30:17.389 --> 02:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
certainly smaller companies that pay BPT
 
02:30:20.090 --> 02:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
02:30:21.290 --> 02:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure we're keeping an
 
02:30:23.690 --> 02:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
eye on the time here it's almost noon uh
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
yes for people yeah I also wanted to
 
02:30:29.270 --> 02:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
just add to that we do have in statue in
 
02:30:30.469 --> 02:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
Roman Tree
 
02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
um part G
 
02:30:33.889 --> 02:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
that the business organizations that's
 
02:30:36.170 --> 02:30:36.180 align:start position:0%
claiming this deduction that their only
 
02:30:38.270 --> 02:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
burden of proof of other than meeting
 
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
the 162a one of the federal code is to
 
02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
show that the Proprietors partners and
 
02:30:49.010 --> 02:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
or members that are claiming uh that
 
02:30:52.130 --> 02:30:52.140 align:start position:0%
they did actual provide personal
 
02:30:52.140 --> 02:30:53.750 align:start position:0%
they did actual provide personal
services

02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:30:56.929 --> 02:30:56.939 align:start position:0%
to to the business and then once that
 
02:30:59.090 --> 02:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
organization has satisfied that burden
 
02:31:00.889 --> 02:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
approved the amount claim as a deduction
 
02:31:03.650 --> 02:31:03.660 align:start position:0%
shall be presumed to be reasonable so we
 
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
do have that coded in in the Statue
 
02:31:05.700 --> 02:31:07.370 align:start position:0%
do have that coded in in the Statue
currently

02:31:07.370 --> 02:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:31:07.380 --> 02:31:08.210 align:start position:0%
currently
um

02:31:08.210 --> 02:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:11.870 --> 02:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
and if if the business was able to say
 
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
that oh yes the uh this particular uh
 
02:31:17.929 --> 02:31:17.939 align:start position:0%
member or owner had
 
02:31:17.939 --> 02:31:19.429 align:start position:0%
member or owner had
provided

02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
provided
 
02:31:22.730 --> 02:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
um a million dollars worth of service
 
02:31:26.510 --> 02:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
um that would be presumed reasonable
 
02:31:30.889 --> 02:31:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:32.990 --> 02:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth thank you
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question now if
 
02:31:36.479 --> 02:31:37.429 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question now if
um

02:31:37.429 --> 02:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:40.250 --> 02:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
something is disallowed I assume the
 
02:31:42.050 --> 02:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
taxpayer has plenty of time to talk to
 
02:31:43.730 --> 02:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
you and get detailed information about
 
02:31:45.770 --> 02:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
you know why is this allowed and so on
 
02:31:47.570 --> 02:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
so we really don't need to change
 
02:31:50.510 --> 02:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
legislation for a taxpayer to do that
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
and kind of defend their choice and all
 
02:31:54.110 --> 02:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
of that you I assume you have a
 
02:31:56.510 --> 02:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
procedure there there is absolutely a
 
02:31:59.270 --> 02:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
procedure so any whether it's
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
disallowing a deduction we're issuing a
 
02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
notice of assessment any any action the
 
02:32:06.590 --> 02:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
department takes is appealable
 
02:32:09.469 --> 02:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
um uh and I want to be respectful of the
 
02:32:11.210 --> 02:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
time so I'll keep this briefer than I've
 
02:32:13.130 --> 02:32:13.140 align:start position:0%
been but yes there is a process in place
 
02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
they have appeal rights
 
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
02:32:20.230 --> 02:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:22.550 --> 02:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
do you think there's any possibility
 
02:32:25.130 --> 02:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
that the form could be confusing to
 
02:32:28.490 --> 02:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
people because if for example
 
02:32:28.500 --> 02:32:29.090 align:start position:0%
people because if for example
um

02:32:29.090 --> 02:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:31.550 --> 02:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
the example that one of the things it
 
02:32:34.610 --> 02:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
says in in the statute is that the
 
02:32:39.530 --> 02:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
compensation for the the owner can't be
 
02:32:41.690 --> 02:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
so high that it causes the business
 
02:32:41.700 --> 02:32:43.370 align:start position:0%
so high that it causes the business
profits

02:32:43.370 --> 02:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
profits
 
02:32:46.969 --> 02:32:46.979 align:start position:0%
profit to go from above zero to below
 
02:32:50.270 --> 02:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
zero so they give themselves a lower
 
02:32:52.490 --> 02:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
compensation that year but they're
 
02:32:54.290 --> 02:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
trying to make up for it the next year
 
02:32:56.570 --> 02:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
is there a confusion when you get to
 
02:32:58.790 --> 02:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
this the second year that they don't
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
know that they should probably I assume
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to report it as
 
02:33:05.030 --> 02:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
compensation and if it looks really high
 
02:33:07.670 --> 02:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
there's some kind of explanation or no
 
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
do you think they get confused and they
 
02:33:12.650 --> 02:33:12.660 align:start position:0%
call it a distribution
 
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
I've not seen that I'm certainly
 
02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
open though to that conversation and we
 
02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:19.610 align:start position:0%
open though to that conversation and we
can

02:33:19.610 --> 02:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:33:21.849 --> 02:33:21.859 align:start position:0%
we would be willing to further clarify
 
02:33:24.770 --> 02:33:24.780 align:start position:0%
uh the forms if that's if that's causing
 
02:33:26.870 --> 02:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
people confusion I've not heard that but
 
02:33:28.969 --> 02:33:28.979 align:start position:0%
we'd be open to working with folks to
 
02:33:31.929 --> 02:33:31.939 align:start position:0%
clarify that thank you for your question
 
02:33:35.570 --> 02:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative Orr thank you
 
02:33:37.670 --> 02:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you gentlemen for
 
02:33:40.910 --> 02:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if my esteemed
 
02:33:43.070 --> 02:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues here knew what a wealth of
 
02:33:45.110 --> 02:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
information you two are
 
02:33:48.889 --> 02:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
uh and how spot-on your answers are
 
02:33:50.750 --> 02:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
I think we would get through this sooner
 
02:33:52.610 --> 02:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
I just have the advantage of
 
02:33:54.530 --> 02:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
I wish you guys have worked for me back
 
02:33:57.770 --> 02:33:57.780 align:start position:0%
in the day so my question is
 
02:34:01.309 --> 02:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
generally speaking
 
02:34:05.510 --> 02:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:10.190 --> 02:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:13.610 --> 02:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
I just want to add to that as well
 
02:34:13.620 --> 02:34:14.450 align:start position:0%
I just want to add to that as well
um

02:34:14.450 --> 02:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:16.190 --> 02:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
that in when the committee is
 
02:34:19.790 --> 02:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
considering to uh to pass or to uh
 
02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
however the committee decides on this
 
02:34:24.910 --> 02:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
bill is that the current legislation
 
02:34:28.010 --> 02:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
Roman tree has built in all this
 
02:34:29.570 --> 02:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
language as representative aubi
 
02:34:32.330 --> 02:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned in terms of guard rails of
 
02:34:35.389 --> 02:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
um how uh what is determined as fair and
 
02:34:36.889 --> 02:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
reasonable compensation and how it's
 
02:34:40.429 --> 02:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
deducted and and so on and so forth
 
02:34:44.690 --> 02:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
um having this additional new um
 
02:34:44.700 --> 02:34:46.910 align:start position:0%
um having this additional new um
section

02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:34:49.130 --> 02:34:49.140 align:start position:0%
um if it is if the intent of that
 
02:34:52.370 --> 02:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
section is to accomplish the same
 
02:34:52.380 --> 02:34:53.450 align:start position:0%
section is to accomplish the same
thing

02:34:53.450 --> 02:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:34:56.929 --> 02:34:56.939 align:start position:0%
but this new section lacks the the guard
 
02:34:59.170 --> 02:34:59.180 align:start position:0%
rails that is available in the current
 
02:35:01.670 --> 02:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
statute language
 
02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
um it as what Fred mentioned it could
 
02:35:08.270 --> 02:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
cause some confusion with the with
 
02:35:10.490 --> 02:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
taxpayers or with practitioners in terms
 
02:35:13.130 --> 02:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
of what exactly is the intent of this
 
02:35:18.770 --> 02:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:21.170 --> 02:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
02:35:23.389 --> 02:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
can't resist this goes back to my
 
02:35:25.670 --> 02:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
earlier question what what was just
 
02:35:27.050 --> 02:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
brought out
 
02:35:31.809 --> 02:35:31.819 align:start position:0%
um isn't it true that any time a statute
 
02:35:36.650 --> 02:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
is added to with a new provision that is
 
02:35:39.650 --> 02:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
similar to but not word by word the same
 
02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:40.610 align:start position:0%
similar to but not word by word the same
as

02:35:40.610 --> 02:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:35:42.550 --> 02:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
the other provision
 
02:35:46.389 --> 02:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
that for the agency
 
02:35:50.030 --> 02:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
implementing that statute there
 
02:35:53.210 --> 02:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
is an expectation and for any Court
 
02:35:56.889 --> 02:35:56.899 align:start position:0%
reviewing actions under the that statute
 
02:36:00.590 --> 02:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
there will be an expectation that this
 
02:36:02.330 --> 02:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
new language
 
02:36:04.429 --> 02:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
has added something
 
02:36:06.889 --> 02:36:06.899 align:start position:0%
and that there will be some burden on
 
02:36:10.309 --> 02:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
you to explain what that added is and
 
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
the arguments and confusion are
 
02:36:15.950 --> 02:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
generated if the if the original thought
 
02:36:20.570 --> 02:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ames thank you for
 
02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
your question and that and that is an
 
02:36:24.710 --> 02:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
excellent point
 
02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
um that that that is absolutely a tenant
 
02:36:31.190 --> 02:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
of statutory construction it's called
 
02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
the Pres it's a presumption so
 
02:36:38.929 --> 02:36:38.939 align:start position:0%
um yes if the the addition of this
 
02:36:38.939 --> 02:36:40.130 align:start position:0%
um yes if the the addition of this
deduction

02:36:40.130 --> 02:36:40.140 align:start position:0%
deduction
 
02:36:42.290 --> 02:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
even if it is
 
02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
totally duplicative at the end of the
 
02:36:47.450 --> 02:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
day as a practical matter does create a
 
02:36:49.190 --> 02:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
presumption that it does something
 
02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:50.870 align:start position:0%
presumption that it does something
different

02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:51.469 align:start position:0%
different
um

02:36:51.469 --> 02:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:55.070 --> 02:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
and then so whichever party wants to
 
02:36:57.230 --> 02:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
make the argument
 
02:36:59.929 --> 02:36:59.939 align:start position:0%
um that it does not has the would
 
02:36:59.939 --> 02:37:00.910 align:start position:0%
um that it does not has the would
potentially

02:37:00.910 --> 02:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
02:37:08.510 --> 02:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:11.280 align:start position:0%

04:24:39.530 --> 04:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
to help effectively accomplish this task
 
04:24:43.130 --> 04:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
and bring in uh experts as potentially
 
04:24:43.140 --> 04:24:44.570 align:start position:0%
and bring in uh experts as potentially
needed

04:24:44.570 --> 04:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
needed
 
04:24:44.580 --> 04:24:45.229 align:start position:0%
needed
um

04:24:45.229 --> 04:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:45.239 --> 04:24:46.490 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:24:46.490 --> 04:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:49.849 --> 04:24:49.859 align:start position:0%
it also and it also ends the um the
 
04:24:49.859 --> 04:24:51.590 align:start position:0%
it also and it also ends the um the
previous

04:24:51.590 --> 04:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
previous
 
04:24:51.600 --> 04:24:52.370 align:start position:0%
previous
um

04:24:52.370 --> 04:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:52.380 --> 04:24:53.510 align:start position:0%
um
permission

04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
permission
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:01.250 --> 04:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:25:03.710 --> 04:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
we that the bill is now open for
 
04:25:05.689 --> 04:25:05.699 align:start position:0%
Amendment so now I think it would be a
 
04:25:08.570 --> 04:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
good time for you to move an amendment
 
04:25:10.729 --> 04:25:10.739 align:start position:0%
and we can decide we can vote on that
 
04:25:15.309 --> 04:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:18.590 --> 04:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
oop I'd like to move Amendment one five
 
04:25:22.550 --> 04:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:25.130 --> 04:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
uh is so you you move that is there a
 
04:25:25.140 --> 04:25:29.170 align:start position:0%
uh is so you you move that is there a
second

04:25:29.170 --> 04:25:29.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:33.229 --> 04:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
okay uh seconded by representative Army
 
04:25:34.070 --> 04:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
um would you like to speak to your
 
04:25:34.080 --> 04:25:35.269 align:start position:0%
um would you like to speak to your
emotionally

04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
emotionally
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
um yes ma'am cheer
 
04:25:40.969 --> 04:25:40.979 align:start position:0%
um after the our session yesterday I was
 
04:25:43.849 --> 04:25:43.859 align:start position:0%
looking at this uh Bill some more and
 
04:25:47.330 --> 04:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
one of the things I recognized is that
 
04:25:50.990 --> 04:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
for appointing it has a pointing
 
04:25:51.000 --> 04:25:51.889 align:start position:0%
for appointing it has a pointing
um

04:25:51.889 --> 04:25:51.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:51.899 --> 04:25:53.450 align:start position:0%
um
uh

04:25:53.450 --> 04:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:25:53.460 --> 04:25:55.450 align:start position:0%
uh
members

04:25:55.450 --> 04:25:55.460 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:25:57.769 --> 04:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
representing the Charities and
 
04:25:59.950 --> 04:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
representing the um
 
04:25:59.960 --> 04:26:01.550 align:start position:0%
representing the um
locations

04:26:01.550 --> 04:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
locations
 
04:26:04.910 --> 04:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
and that in both cases it didn't
 
04:26:07.490 --> 04:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
identify who would make that an
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
appointment so standard format for a
 
04:26:13.610 --> 04:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
study committee or Commission
 
04:26:15.950 --> 04:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
you know usually it starts out the the
 
04:26:18.830 --> 04:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
president of the Senate re points Senate
 
04:26:21.229 --> 04:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
Senators and that speaker the house
 
04:26:23.870 --> 04:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
appoints representatives from the house
 
04:26:26.030 --> 04:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
and for the other positions it
 
04:26:29.090 --> 04:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
identifies who makes those appointments
 
04:26:32.929 --> 04:26:32.939 align:start position:0%
so to address that situation which if we
 
04:26:34.729 --> 04:26:34.739 align:start position:0%
passed it without this amendment I think
 
04:26:37.670 --> 04:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
it would seriously hold up the formation
 
04:26:39.410 --> 04:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
of the committee because there'd have to
 
04:26:41.090 --> 04:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
be some kind of
 
04:26:43.550 --> 04:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
you know resolution of who would make
 
04:26:46.309 --> 04:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
those appointments so
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
um the amendment changes it to one
 
04:26:50.630 --> 04:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
member appointed by the New Hampshire
 
04:26:53.090 --> 04:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operators
 
04:26:56.809 --> 04:26:56.819 align:start position:0%
and uh they're the current bill has two
 
04:26:59.990 --> 04:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
members from Charities but I changed
 
04:27:04.070 --> 04:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
this to one member appointed by the um
 
04:27:06.349 --> 04:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Center for Center for
 
04:27:06.359 --> 04:27:08.330 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Center for Center for
non-profits

04:27:08.330 --> 04:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
non-profits
 
04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
so that's a technical correction
 
04:27:12.239 --> 04:27:13.729 align:start position:0%
so that's a technical correction
and

04:27:13.729 --> 04:27:13.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:16.370 --> 04:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
um I know Senator former former
 
04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative abrami said that he felt
 
04:27:21.050 --> 04:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
a commission could go beyond the scope
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
of the items that were specifically
 
04:27:28.729 --> 04:27:28.739 align:start position:0%
identified in the bill but I think since
 
04:27:31.130 --> 04:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
I was making this one change anyway I
 
04:27:33.490 --> 04:27:33.500 align:start position:0%
just added something to the bottom about
 
04:27:37.010 --> 04:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
if other issues came up they could also
 
04:27:41.990 --> 04:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.830 --> 04:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
other comments on the amendment number
 
04:27:49.189 --> 04:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
1517 representative Platt a question how
 
04:27:51.370 --> 04:27:51.380 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Center for nonprofits
 
04:27:53.929 --> 04:27:53.939 align:start position:0%
relates with all the non-profits in New
 
04:27:55.370 --> 04:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they do a good job
 
04:27:59.510 --> 04:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:05.410 --> 04:28:05.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:07.550 --> 04:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative set and then
 
04:28:10.070 --> 04:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative oh whatever go ahead
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'm sorry and and to to uh
 
04:28:14.929 --> 04:28:14.939 align:start position:0%
representative Platt's point Thank you
 
04:28:17.090 --> 04:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
madam chair I didn't even know and I I
 
04:28:19.010 --> 04:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
considered myself pretty well tuned into
 
04:28:21.290 --> 04:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
the non-profits and the charities in the
 
04:28:23.689 --> 04:28:23.699 align:start position:0%
state I don't know who these people are
 
04:28:28.010 --> 04:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
so I I have no idea how to vote on this
 
04:28:29.570 --> 04:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
amendment other than
 
04:28:31.610 --> 04:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
without knowledge of
 
04:28:33.170 --> 04:28:33.180 align:start position:0%
you know and I I was on that
 
04:28:36.769 --> 04:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so I've never heard seen or
 
04:28:38.630 --> 04:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
took taken testimony from this group
 
04:28:40.670 --> 04:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
short of this piece of paper that was
 
04:28:43.790 --> 04:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
handed out to us yesterday
 
04:28:43.800 --> 04:28:46.849 align:start position:0%
handed out to us yesterday
representative

04:28:46.849 --> 04:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I do know something about the
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
non-profits because I I
 
04:28:54.889 --> 04:28:54.899 align:start position:0%
communicate with a large number of
 
04:28:57.530 --> 04:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
different kinds of non-profits I presume
 
04:28:58.910 --> 04:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd knows something
 
04:29:03.229 --> 04:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
about them too on but they do training
 
04:29:03.239 --> 04:29:04.689 align:start position:0%
about them too on but they do training
courses

04:29:04.689 --> 04:29:04.699 align:start position:0%
courses
 
04:29:08.809 --> 04:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
both in financial matters and in
 
04:29:11.689 --> 04:29:11.699 align:start position:0%
um in other legal matters for
 
04:29:11.699 --> 04:29:13.969 align:start position:0%
um in other legal matters for
non-profits

04:29:13.969 --> 04:29:13.979 align:start position:0%
non-profits
 
04:29:13.979 --> 04:29:14.630 align:start position:0%
non-profits
um

04:29:14.630 --> 04:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:17.330 --> 04:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
they seem to be fairly well respected by
 
04:29:19.670 --> 04:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
the non-profit Community they haven't
 
04:29:22.849 --> 04:29:22.859 align:start position:0%
specifically dealt with problem gaming
 
04:29:25.070 --> 04:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
but they would be in a much better
 
04:29:27.290 --> 04:29:27.300 align:start position:0%
position than the house clerk who I
 
04:29:29.570 --> 04:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
think this would have to default to
 
04:29:29.580 --> 04:29:31.070 align:start position:0%
think this would have to default to
to

04:29:31.070 --> 04:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:29:33.110 --> 04:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
um bring to the table
 
04:29:36.290 --> 04:29:36.300 align:start position:0%
a variety of non-profits that are taking
 
04:29:39.469 --> 04:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
money from charitable gaming
 
04:29:39.479 --> 04:29:40.670 align:start position:0%
money from charitable gaming
um

04:29:40.670 --> 04:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:42.710 --> 04:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
I'd like to
 
04:29:47.330 --> 04:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
to ask representative Lloyd to say more
 
04:29:50.210 --> 04:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
and also because she's in this field but
 
04:29:54.710 --> 04:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
yeah when we were taking a testimony
 
04:29:58.189 --> 04:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
um yesterday I I had asked who would be
 
04:30:00.710 --> 04:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
doing the appointing of the non-profit
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
organizations because if you're looking
 
04:30:06.410 --> 04:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
at a dollar amount in front of you for a
 
04:30:08.809 --> 04:30:08.819 align:start position:0%
large non-profit that like if you're
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
looking at let's say two thousand
 
04:30:12.590 --> 04:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
dollars that two thousand dollars may
 
04:30:15.110 --> 04:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
just be a drop in the bucket but for a
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
very small non-profit that has maybe
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
five ten individuals who are working at
 
04:30:23.389 --> 04:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
that company or that organization that
 
04:30:25.429 --> 04:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars could very well be
 
04:30:28.490 --> 04:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
a huge amount in their budget so
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
um it just we want to make sure that
 
04:30:32.990 --> 04:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's representation that's kind of
 
04:30:36.110 --> 04:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
equal and and somehow decided in the
 
04:30:38.269 --> 04:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
non-profits so
 
04:30:40.070 --> 04:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy
 
04:30:43.250 --> 04:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you they testified and they passed
 
04:30:45.110 --> 04:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
out this she to all of us the New
 
04:30:46.490 --> 04:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Center for non-profits and
 
04:30:48.710 --> 04:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
then on top of that they spelled out
 
04:30:51.110 --> 04:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
their uh reason for existence and their
 
04:30:54.229 --> 04:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
mission it's the strings and strengthens
 
04:30:56.570 --> 04:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
and gives voice to the state's nonprofit
 
04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
sector through leadership collaboration
 
04:31:00.649 --> 04:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
and learning opportunities our vision is
 
04:31:02.210 --> 04:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
that all individuals families and
 
04:31:03.710 --> 04:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
communities Thrive because New Hampshire
 
04:31:06.290 --> 04:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
is home to vibrant impactful nonprofits
 
04:31:08.330 --> 04:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
and so we we did hear and we all
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
received this so I would say that they
 
04:31:14.929 --> 04:31:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:18.769 --> 04:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:21.050 --> 04:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
hold on Harkin Phillips
 
04:31:24.250 --> 04:31:24.260 align:start position:0%
hack and Phillips like a computer hack
 
04:31:27.649 --> 04:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
thank you um Madam chair I just wanted
 
04:31:30.290 --> 04:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
to weigh in quickly so I do provide uh
 
04:31:32.389 --> 04:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
pro bono Council to a non-profit based
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
here in the state and I just wanted to
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
share with you that I do reference the
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Center
 
04:31:41.990 --> 04:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
um for non-profits uh regularly
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
throughout um
 
04:31:45.889 --> 04:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
the formation process for other
 
04:31:48.349 --> 04:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
non-profits as well as continuing on an
 
04:31:50.149 --> 04:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
annual basis I refer back to their best
 
04:31:52.729 --> 04:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
practice documents specifically for the
 
04:31:55.729 --> 04:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
com conflict of interest policies that
 
04:31:56.929 --> 04:31:56.939 align:start position:0%
both of
 
04:31:59.929 --> 04:31:59.939 align:start position:0%
the nonprofits I help with um
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
kind of refer back to in their own
 
04:32:03.530 --> 04:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
policy making decisions because the
 
04:32:04.969 --> 04:32:04.979 align:start position:0%
center of
 
04:32:04.979 --> 04:32:05.809 align:start position:0%
center of
um

04:32:05.809 --> 04:32:05.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:07.729 --> 04:32:07.739 align:start position:0%
for non-profits here in New Hampshire is
 
04:32:09.530 --> 04:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
known as kind of a national leader in
 
04:32:11.990 --> 04:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
terms of providing that conflict of
 
04:32:14.990 --> 04:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
interest Forward Thinking policy and I
 
04:32:16.370 --> 04:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
know that the state of New Hampshire is
 
04:32:18.170 --> 04:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
also recognized for being ahead of the
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
curve in the new non-profit sector
 
04:32:22.729 --> 04:32:22.739 align:start position:0%
across this country in terms of you know
 
04:32:25.370 --> 04:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
having those forward-thinking ideas
 
04:32:28.729 --> 04:32:28.739 align:start position:0%
about keeping conflicts at the Forefront
 
04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
of nonprofit management
 
04:32:33.469 --> 04:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
so I would just like to throw in my two
 
04:32:35.210 --> 04:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
cents about how I do believe that this
 
04:32:38.450 --> 04:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
is a worthy organization to consider you
 
04:32:40.189 --> 04:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
know putting on the commission moving
 
04:32:40.199 --> 04:32:41.030 align:start position:0%
know putting on the commission moving
forward

04:32:41.030 --> 04:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:32:42.410 --> 04:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
represent fellows um yes I would just
 
04:32:46.670 --> 04:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
like to add that I think it's important
 
04:32:49.389 --> 04:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
to represent the Charities we have
 
04:32:53.330 --> 04:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
somebody whose perspective covers the
 
04:32:54.649 --> 04:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
Charities that are currently
 
04:32:57.710 --> 04:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
participating in receiving money from
 
04:33:01.910 --> 04:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
from the gaming and those who are maybe
 
04:33:05.510 --> 04:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
would like to and are not able to
 
04:33:07.369 --> 04:33:07.379 align:start position:0%
because there is certainly just a
 
04:33:09.529 --> 04:33:09.539 align:start position:0%
limited number of slots so I think this
 
04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
organization can
 
04:33:13.490 --> 04:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
make sure that we get a perspective that
 
04:33:17.510 --> 04:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
covers the a wider range of the charity
 
04:33:19.849 --> 04:33:19.859 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury are you okay
 
04:33:22.369 --> 04:33:22.379 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I would just note
 
04:33:24.349 --> 04:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
that the effect of the amendment would
 
04:33:26.570 --> 04:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
be to change the composition of the
 
04:33:29.810 --> 04:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
commission from an odd numbered 13 to an
 
04:33:32.510 --> 04:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
even number 12. and I believe that's
 
04:33:35.090 --> 04:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
generally not what we try to do
 
04:33:38.449 --> 04:33:38.459 align:start position:0%
also I think the intent of the bill is
 
04:33:41.769 --> 04:33:41.779 align:start position:0%
to find representatives of Charities
 
04:33:45.970 --> 04:33:45.980 align:start position:0%
rather than representatives of
 
04:33:50.570 --> 04:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:53.390 --> 04:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent I saw Ames over here I
 
04:33:55.609 --> 04:33:55.619 align:start position:0%
think did you
 
04:33:59.689 --> 04:33:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:01.849 --> 04:34:01.859 align:start position:0%
I think there there does seem to be a
 
04:34:05.390 --> 04:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
void a uh Omission in this uh in the
 
04:34:05.400 --> 04:34:06.289 align:start position:0%
void a uh Omission in this uh in the
bill

04:34:06.289 --> 04:34:06.299 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:34:08.449 --> 04:34:08.459 align:start position:0%
that this amendment
 
04:34:12.109 --> 04:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
bills and that is uh no it's not there's
 
04:34:14.810 --> 04:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
no designation of who will choose
 
04:34:16.970 --> 04:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
the representative of the Facility
 
04:34:19.070 --> 04:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
Owners and who will choose the
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
representatives of charitable gaming
 
04:34:24.010 --> 04:34:24.020 align:start position:0%
Charities just completely left out
 
04:34:25.970 --> 04:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:34:29.750 --> 04:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
I think correcting that is uh probably
 
04:34:32.689 --> 04:34:32.699 align:start position:0%
quite important in terms of uh getting
 
04:34:34.369 --> 04:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
this off the ground
 
04:34:37.131 --> 04:34:37.141 align:start position:0%
representative fellows said that she
 
04:34:39.890 --> 04:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
thought it might delay the startup
 
04:34:42.051 --> 04:34:42.061 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
absence of Direction on that issue and
 
04:34:48.650 --> 04:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
uh she may be well be right although I'd
 
04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
be happy to be corrected by any member
 
04:34:53.810 --> 04:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
here who has more information on that
 
04:34:58.609 --> 04:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
point uh if if it is uh if if it is an
 
04:35:01.131 --> 04:35:01.141 align:start position:0%
Omission that matters then we should
 
04:35:03.410 --> 04:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
address it
 
04:35:05.810 --> 04:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
representative elberger thank you madam
 
04:35:08.029 --> 04:35:08.039 align:start position:0%
chair I agree with representative
 
04:35:11.150 --> 04:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
spilsbury about the notion of having a
 
04:35:14.029 --> 04:35:14.039 align:start position:0%
charity rather than an organization that
 
04:35:16.189 --> 04:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
consults to Charities but if you look at
 
04:35:18.769 --> 04:35:18.779 align:start position:0%
the wording it says one member chosen by
 
04:35:20.689 --> 04:35:20.699 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Center
 
04:35:22.631 --> 04:35:22.641 align:start position:0%
for non-profits
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
and I think that uh
 
04:35:29.570 --> 04:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
number one nobody was named as the
 
04:35:32.330 --> 04:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
appointing authority for that member or
 
04:35:34.510 --> 04:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
members at that time
 
04:35:37.250 --> 04:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
and this group is much more likely to
 
04:35:39.230 --> 04:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
have an idea of
 
04:35:42.109 --> 04:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
what charities might be or charity or
 
04:35:45.289 --> 04:35:45.299 align:start position:0%
Charities might be an appropriate one to
 
04:35:48.109 --> 04:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
name rather than leaving it to some
 
04:35:50.510 --> 04:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
unknown person and who may not know
 
04:35:52.250 --> 04:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
anything about the charitable
 
04:35:57.170 --> 04:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:58.429 --> 04:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
the comments on the amendment I'm
 
04:35:59.869 --> 04:35:59.879 align:start position:0%
looking around makeup representative
 
04:35:59.879 --> 04:36:01.849 align:start position:0%
looking around makeup representative
Doucette

04:36:01.849 --> 04:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
Doucette
 
04:36:04.429 --> 04:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
point is well taken but but again if
 
04:36:06.289 --> 04:36:06.299 align:start position:0%
we're talking about being concerned
 
04:36:10.369 --> 04:36:10.379 align:start position:0%
about an unknown entity assigning this
 
04:36:12.289 --> 04:36:12.299 align:start position:0%
is an unknown entity and I'm not
 
04:36:14.929 --> 04:36:14.939 align:start position:0%
challenging their validity their mission
 
04:36:17.390 --> 04:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
their statement what they do for work
 
04:36:20.990 --> 04:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
but to to have someone something put in
 
04:36:23.869 --> 04:36:23.879 align:start position:0%
front of us at the 11th hour here
 
04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
um and I participated in the
 
04:36:27.769 --> 04:36:27.779 align:start position:0%
subcommittee along with representative
 
04:36:27.779 --> 04:36:28.910 align:start position:0%
subcommittee along with representative
Ames

04:36:28.910 --> 04:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
Ames
 
04:36:31.189 --> 04:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
it was the vision of that subcommittee
 
04:36:33.289 --> 04:36:33.299 align:start position:0%
to have the Charities the people that
 
04:36:34.849 --> 04:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
have got the dirt under their
 
04:36:36.650 --> 04:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
fingernails for years
 
04:36:39.410 --> 04:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
getting to us to where we are in the
 
04:36:41.330 --> 04:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming model that we have at
 
04:36:41.340 --> 04:36:43.369 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming model that we have at
present

04:36:43.369 --> 04:36:43.379 align:start position:0%
present
 
04:36:45.830 --> 04:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I have a real hard time and
 
04:36:47.929 --> 04:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
it's probably a very valuable
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
component here
 
04:36:52.310 --> 04:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
but I I can't with good conscience vote
 
04:36:55.730 --> 04:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
to give an entity that I know absolutely
 
04:36:57.470 --> 04:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
nothing about
 
04:37:01.730 --> 04:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
appointment Authority in a commission
 
04:37:04.789 --> 04:37:04.799 align:start position:0%
just it doesn't make logic to me
 
04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative Platt I am treasurer of

until the the testimony of the other day
 
04:37:16.010 --> 04:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
I've never heard of this group so
 
04:37:17.150 --> 04:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
they're not well known among the
 
04:37:21.349 --> 04:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
Charities uh very at all
 
04:37:25.670 --> 04:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
I've always thought
 
04:37:31.490 --> 04:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
they should be more outward ranging but
 
04:37:33.890 --> 04:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
they are the nuts and bolts behind the
 
04:37:33.900 --> 04:37:35.449 align:start position:0%
they are the nuts and bolts behind the
Charities

04:37:35.449 --> 04:37:35.459 align:start position:0%
Charities
 
04:37:35.459 --> 04:37:37.429 align:start position:0%
Charities
um

04:37:37.429 --> 04:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:42.709 --> 04:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
what we've got now is I believe that the
 
04:37:45.170 --> 04:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
house clerk is going to be responsible
 
04:37:47.390 --> 04:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
to figure out
 
04:37:50.029 --> 04:37:50.039 align:start position:0%
who would represent the Facility Owners
 
04:37:52.810 --> 04:37:52.820 align:start position:0%
and who would represent two Charities
 
04:37:56.090 --> 04:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
when there is a very wide range of
 
04:37:58.250 --> 04:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
charitable interests
 
04:38:00.590 --> 04:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
and then of course also leaves out the
 
04:38:03.529 --> 04:38:03.539 align:start position:0%
ones who are left out at this point who
 
04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to get on the lists
 
04:38:06.719 --> 04:38:09.949 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to get on the lists
um

04:38:09.949 --> 04:38:09.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:12.890 --> 04:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
04:38:15.349 --> 04:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
preferable if we want to leave out the
 
04:38:17.869 --> 04:38:17.879 align:start position:0%
ones who can't get on the lists
 
04:38:21.529 --> 04:38:21.539 align:start position:0%
that it could be changed to
 
04:38:21.539 --> 04:38:22.789 align:start position:0%
that it could be changed to
or

04:38:22.789 --> 04:38:22.799 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:38:25.970 --> 04:38:25.980 align:start position:0%

04:38:31.730 --> 04:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
but in that case
 
04:38:31.740 --> 04:38:32.750 align:start position:0%
but in that case
um

04:38:32.750 --> 04:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
they would be picking the ones that will
 
04:38:37.609 --> 04:38:37.619 align:start position:0%
most likely parrot but they're saying so
 
04:38:40.310 --> 04:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
they won't be terribly helpful uh
 
04:38:42.650 --> 04:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
probably I may be maligning the
 
04:38:49.369 --> 04:38:49.379 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:51.410 --> 04:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
but we do
 
04:38:51.420 --> 04:38:52.730 align:start position:0%
but we do
um

04:38:52.730 --> 04:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:56.570 --> 04:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
we do need somebody that that can pick
 
04:38:59.090 --> 04:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
in both of these entities and I think
 
04:39:01.010 --> 04:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
that the solution of the New Hampshire
 
04:39:03.650 --> 04:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operators Association
 
04:39:07.551 --> 04:39:07.561 align:start position:0%
for the facilities owners makes sense he
 
04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
has been a facility operator I don't
 
04:39:14.269 --> 04:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
think he is one at the moment but he
 
04:39:16.789 --> 04:39:16.799 align:start position:0%
works directly I mean he is working for
 
04:39:19.189 --> 04:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
the Facility Owners
 
04:39:19.199 --> 04:39:21.051 align:start position:0%
the Facility Owners
um

04:39:21.051 --> 04:39:21.061 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:23.631 --> 04:39:23.641 align:start position:0%
and if you don't
 
04:39:23.641 --> 04:39:24.349 align:start position:0%
and if you don't
um

04:39:24.349 --> 04:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:26.209 --> 04:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
haven't heard of the New Hampshire
 
04:39:29.510 --> 04:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
Center for non-profits
 
04:39:29.520 --> 04:39:31.070 align:start position:0%
Center for non-profits
um

04:39:31.070 --> 04:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:33.890 --> 04:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure who we'd
 
04:39:37.610 --> 04:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
who we could substitute that would be
 
04:39:42.110 --> 04:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
better at this than the house Clerk
 
04:39:44.448 --> 04:39:44.458 align:start position:0%
which I think is the default mechanism
 
04:39:47.090 --> 04:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
if they forgot we forgot to stick it
 
04:39:51.230 --> 04:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:54.288 --> 04:39:54.298 align:start position:0%
okay other final comments did you have
 
04:39:56.930 --> 04:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
something else I'm not sure thank you
 
04:39:58.610 --> 04:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
madam chair I'm not sure how to fit this
 
04:40:01.970 --> 04:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
in if at all but again following up on
 
04:40:05.690 --> 04:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
representative almie's comment it might
 
04:40:08.750 --> 04:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
be useful to have one if there are going
 
04:40:11.330 --> 04:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
to be two Charities to have one of them
 
04:40:14.448 --> 04:40:14.458 align:start position:0%
be a current recipient within the
 
04:40:18.230 --> 04:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
framework of the historical horse racing
 
04:40:20.270 --> 04:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
and one who is not
 
04:40:28.090 --> 04:40:28.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:31.788 --> 04:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
comments on the amendment yes um
 
04:40:35.690 --> 04:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
so I picked that particular organization
 
04:40:38.330 --> 04:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
because that was the only one I had any
 
04:40:40.970 --> 04:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
information from based on the testimony
 
04:40:43.610 --> 04:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
that we received but does if if anyone
 
04:40:45.230 --> 04:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
else has a
 
04:40:47.510 --> 04:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
knows about another organization that
 
04:40:50.090 --> 04:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
would be a better one to represent the
 
04:40:52.010 --> 04:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
Charities I think that would be good but
 
04:40:54.230 --> 04:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to get you know
 
04:40:56.208 --> 04:40:56.218 align:start position:0%
Charities are not all in the same place
 
04:40:59.150 --> 04:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
and some may want to join
 
04:41:01.850 --> 04:41:01.860 align:start position:0%
and that may be part of the what should
 
04:41:04.250 --> 04:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
be looked at you know should there be a
 
04:41:06.708 --> 04:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
way to cover include more Charities or
 
04:41:09.470 --> 04:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
not you know so that's
 
04:41:11.448 --> 04:41:11.458 align:start position:0%
along with the fact that you we need to
 
04:41:13.730 --> 04:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
identify who makes a choice
 
04:41:15.770 --> 04:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
I certainly would be
 
04:41:18.350 --> 04:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
able to have another organization if
 
04:41:22.788 --> 04:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:25.670 --> 04:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments on the amendment
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
yo yes I'm sorry I missed you no thank
 
04:41:31.010 --> 04:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
you go ahead please yes mainly for the
 
04:41:33.288 --> 04:41:33.298 align:start position:0%
chair it does seem like
 
04:41:35.570 --> 04:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
um bills that have commissions should
 
04:41:37.190 --> 04:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
have appointments
 
04:41:40.070 --> 04:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
and who does the appointing and this
 
04:41:43.190 --> 04:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't for certain positions so is
 
04:41:44.510 --> 04:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
that something we really should
 
04:41:47.570 --> 04:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
straighten out as a committee before we
 
04:41:49.850 --> 04:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
take you know the next step and then
 
04:41:52.610 --> 04:41:52.620 align:start position:0%
also to confirm is the default always
 
04:41:56.208 --> 04:41:56.218 align:start position:0%
the clerk or are there other options
 
04:41:58.490 --> 04:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
um again though I think to have a clean
 
04:42:00.070 --> 04:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
bill go forward
 
04:42:04.310 --> 04:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
it would seem worthwhile to State
 
04:42:06.288 --> 04:42:06.298 align:start position:0%
exactly how you know the other
 
04:42:10.910 --> 04:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:13.910 --> 04:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
other comments on the amendment
 
04:42:16.128 --> 04:42:16.138 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none the clerk will call the
 
04:42:19.250 --> 04:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
roll and the motion is ought to pass on
 
04:42:19.260 --> 04:42:22.510 align:start position:0%
roll and the motion is ought to pass on

04:43:24.110 --> 04:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment 1517 fails are there any
 
04:43:29.150 --> 04:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
other amendments on Senate bill 51.
 
04:43:31.070 --> 04:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none down the motion before us
 
04:43:34.250 --> 04:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
will be on the ought to pass motion of
 
04:43:37.610 --> 04:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
the original Senate Bill 51. uh that was
 
04:43:40.670 --> 04:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
moved by representative janikin did you
 
04:43:43.310 --> 04:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:43.320 --> 04:43:44.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:43:44.390 --> 04:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:46.610 --> 04:43:46.620 align:start position:0%
no I think um I think we're good my
 
04:43:48.948 --> 04:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
comments from the initial
 
04:43:53.690 --> 04:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
uh Bill moving on to pass still stand
 
04:43:55.430 --> 04:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
other comments from the committee on the
 
04:43:57.288 --> 04:43:57.298 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion representative ores
 
04:44:00.050 --> 04:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
did you uh want to say anything or are
 
04:44:02.930 --> 04:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
you good okay uh represent all me
 
04:44:05.330 --> 04:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
thank you this puts me in somewhat a
 
04:44:08.150 --> 04:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
dilemma because we are issuing as a
 
04:44:10.850 --> 04:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
final vote oh no it is early but it will
 
04:44:12.650 --> 04:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
be going to a committee which is only
 
04:44:17.090 --> 04:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
looking at the finances so we can't uh
 
04:44:21.948 --> 04:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
get the policy changed which is flawed
 
04:44:24.530 --> 04:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
um and you say it's coming out of left
 
04:44:26.448 --> 04:44:26.458 align:start position:0%
field but it came out of left field
 
04:44:29.448 --> 04:44:29.458 align:start position:0%
because we only heard this bill last
 
04:44:29.458 --> 04:44:30.470 align:start position:0%
because we only heard this bill last
week

04:44:30.470 --> 04:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
week
 
04:44:33.170 --> 04:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
and we hadn't had a chance to discuss it
 
04:44:35.750 --> 04:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
among ourselves yet
 
04:44:35.760 --> 04:44:37.670 align:start position:0%
among ourselves yet
um

04:44:37.670 --> 04:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:37.680 --> 04:44:39.110 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:44:39.110 --> 04:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:39.120 --> 04:44:40.970 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:44:40.970 --> 04:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:43.310 --> 04:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
and I hadn't realized that a lot of
 
04:44:45.410 --> 04:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
people didn't know what the center for
 
04:44:47.810 --> 04:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire nonprofits is they have
 
04:44:50.810 --> 04:44:50.820 align:start position:0%
quite an illustrious board I just looked
 
04:44:51.770 --> 04:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
it up
 
04:44:51.780 --> 04:44:54.770 align:start position:0%
it up
but

04:44:54.770 --> 04:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:44:54.780 --> 04:44:58.208 align:start position:0%
but
um

04:44:58.208 --> 04:44:58.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:02.410 --> 04:45:02.420 align:start position:0%
we do have the moratorium
 
04:45:05.830 --> 04:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
extension which is the only moratorium
 
04:45:08.810 --> 04:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
extension that the Senate and the
 
04:45:11.150 --> 04:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
governor are likely to accept
 
04:45:19.250 --> 04:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:22.430 --> 04:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
04:45:25.610 --> 04:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
so I guess I will vote for it but I
 
04:45:27.830 --> 04:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
would like to see our Amendment try to
 
04:45:30.170 --> 04:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
be defended on the floor once we've
 
04:45:31.970 --> 04:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
managed to recruit a few more people who
 
04:45:34.670 --> 04:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
know what the center for nonprofits is
 
04:45:36.350 --> 04:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:45:38.510 --> 04:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh other comments from the
 
04:45:39.830 --> 04:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee members on ought to pass
 
04:45:39.840 --> 04:45:41.030 align:start position:0%
committee members on ought to pass
motion

04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:45:45.770 --> 04:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:47.690 --> 04:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
I will vote for this
 
04:45:47.700 --> 04:45:48.670 align:start position:0%
I will vote for this
um

04:45:48.670 --> 04:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:53.448 --> 04:45:53.458 align:start position:0%
and do so recognizing that I wish
 
04:45:55.788 --> 04:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
that were slightly improved on a couple
 
04:45:57.410 --> 04:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
of points not all of which have been
 
04:46:00.590 --> 04:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned here but uh I think that it's
 
04:46:02.270 --> 04:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
important that we go ahead with this
 
04:46:05.570 --> 04:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
bill is it an important issue that this
 
04:46:09.350 --> 04:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
commission will be addressing and
 
04:46:09.360 --> 04:46:10.010 align:start position:0%
commission will be addressing and
um

04:46:10.010 --> 04:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh it's an issue that's Dynamic it's
 
04:46:15.948 --> 04:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
moving there's actions that we're all
 
04:46:17.810 --> 04:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
being asked to take on this bill and
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
that bill that relate to charitable
 
04:46:19.320 --> 04:46:20.410 align:start position:0%
that bill that relate to charitable
gaming

04:46:20.410 --> 04:46:20.420 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
we need uh we need a group that's
 
04:46:26.150 --> 04:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
charged with the responsibility of
 
04:46:29.288 --> 04:46:29.298 align:start position:0%
looking at the whole and uh and uh
 
04:46:33.010 --> 04:46:33.020 align:start position:0%
sorting it out uh in an intelligent and
 
04:46:35.830 --> 04:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
useful way for all of us
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
and then on the particular problem of
 
04:46:40.320 --> 04:46:41.690 align:start position:0%
and then on the particular problem of
appointments

04:46:41.690 --> 04:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
04:46:45.490 --> 04:46:45.500 align:start position:0%
um it is the fact that this bill will go
 
04:46:47.650 --> 04:46:47.660 align:start position:0%
if it
 
04:46:51.610 --> 04:46:51.620 align:start position:0%
passes on the floor which I hope it will
 
04:46:54.350 --> 04:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
to the finance committee as a second
 
04:46:59.750 --> 04:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee for review and it is a reality
 
04:47:03.050 --> 04:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
much as some of us may want to wish it
 
04:47:05.628 --> 04:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
were not that second committee is
 
04:47:09.110 --> 04:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
although charged with a narrow charge to
 
04:47:11.948 --> 04:47:11.958 align:start position:0%
focus on in the case of Finance
 
04:47:14.868 --> 04:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
Financial issues I can guarantee you
 
04:47:17.350 --> 04:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
that the finance committee is not always
 
04:47:19.430 --> 04:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
huge to that
 
04:47:22.970 --> 04:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
Narrow Path and that um
 
04:47:25.730 --> 04:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
that if there's an issue like the one
 
04:47:27.948 --> 04:47:27.958 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing here about who's
 
04:47:31.810 --> 04:47:31.820 align:start position:0%
going to appoint to these positions
 
04:47:36.110 --> 04:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
that it would not surprise me if the uh
 
04:47:40.810 --> 04:47:40.820 align:start position:0%
if that issue uh found if a way
 
04:47:44.448 --> 04:47:44.458 align:start position:0%
were to be found to resolve that issue
 
04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the course of its uh Passage through
 
04:47:49.730 --> 04:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
the house for that second committee
 
04:47:54.050 --> 04:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
review so that's where I stand thank you
 
04:47:55.970 --> 04:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
comments on the ought to pass motion
 
04:47:58.430 --> 04:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham yes thank you
 
04:47:59.990 --> 04:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
very much as a member of the finance
 
04:48:02.270 --> 04:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
committee I'm shocked to hear what you
 
04:48:02.280 --> 04:48:04.270 align:start position:0%
committee I'm shocked to hear what you
said

04:48:04.270 --> 04:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:48:07.550 --> 04:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
but uh you know I I I would encourage
 
04:48:09.110 --> 04:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
the group if there is a floor amendment
 
04:48:12.170 --> 04:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
that every that both parties feel is uh
 
04:48:15.770 --> 04:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
uh creates a stronger Bill uh you know
 
04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
by all means I hope we we go forward
 
04:48:19.610 --> 04:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
with that it does certainly seem to make
 
04:48:22.850 --> 04:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
sense to have uh the issue of whether
 
04:48:25.788 --> 04:48:25.798 align:start position:0%
there's 13 or 12 members finalized as
 
04:48:29.470 --> 04:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
well as uh who selects all the members
 
04:48:31.970 --> 04:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
but obviously this is a very important
 
04:48:34.730 --> 04:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
bill and I'd sure like the numbers to be
 
04:48:36.230 --> 04:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
the only issue that there's any
 
04:48:37.850 --> 04:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
disagreement about should it reach
 
04:48:42.190 --> 04:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:43.850 --> 04:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
representative Ames did you have
 
04:48:44.990 --> 04:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
anything else to add
 
04:48:46.910 --> 04:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
just checking I'm just looking for the
 
04:48:48.650 --> 04:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
the red lights
 
04:48:50.090 --> 04:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
um okay if there's no more comments then
 
04:48:52.430 --> 04:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
we will now take uh the role the clerk
 
04:48:53.690 --> 04:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
will call the role on the ought to pass
 
04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%

04:49:58.080 --> 04:49:59.650 align:start position:0%
but if there's going to be a floor
Amendment

04:49:59.650 --> 04:49:59.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:50:02.330 --> 04:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
well uh well
 
04:50:03.948 --> 04:50:03.958 align:start position:0%
either way it can't go on consent
 
04:50:05.330 --> 04:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
calendar quickly if I'm wrong
 
04:50:07.128 --> 04:50:07.138 align:start position:0%
Representatives only um but because it
 
04:50:08.990 --> 04:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
has an FN and it is a second committee
 
04:50:11.510 --> 04:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
bill it would not go on consent make
 
04:50:11.520 --> 04:50:12.590 align:start position:0%
bill it would not go on consent make
sense

04:50:12.590 --> 04:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:50:15.770 --> 04:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
okay all right the vote being 20-0 as
 
04:50:17.090 --> 04:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
ought to pass it will go on the regular
 
04:50:18.890 --> 04:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
calendar we will now close the exact
 
04:50:22.190 --> 04:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
session on Senate bill 51. it's more of
 
04:50:24.410 --> 04:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
a point yes
 
04:50:26.208 --> 04:50:26.218 align:start position:0%
I thought I was hearing that it might be
 
04:50:28.070 --> 04:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
able to be amended in finance anyway
 
04:50:30.170 --> 04:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
which would mean there might not have to
 
04:50:32.090 --> 04:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
be a floor amendment I mean so there's a
 
04:50:32.100 --> 04:50:33.770 align:start position:0%
be a floor amendment I mean so there's a
choice

04:50:33.770 --> 04:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
choice
 
04:50:35.990 --> 04:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah people can decide which way
 
04:50:37.490 --> 04:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
they want to go but it absolutely is
 
04:50:39.650 --> 04:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
supposed to go to finance according to
 
04:50:41.750 --> 04:50:41.760 align:start position:0%

numerical order with things that we're
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
ready for
 
04:50:50.208 --> 04:50:50.218 align:start position:0%

motion certainly thank you madam chair
 
04:51:15.590 --> 04:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
um although the intent of the
 
04:51:17.868 --> 04:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
legislation as it was explained to us in
 
04:51:20.750 --> 04:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
testimony from its prime sponsor is uh
 
04:51:23.868 --> 04:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
we can all agree uh there's a need for
 
04:51:25.250 --> 04:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
those scholarships for the Community
 
04:51:28.250 --> 04:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
College this particular vehicle with
 
04:51:30.890 --> 04:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
with the flaws in the in the legislation
 
04:51:30.900 --> 04:51:32.810 align:start position:0%
with the flaws in the in the legislation
itself

04:51:32.810 --> 04:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
itself
 
04:51:32.820 --> 04:51:34.010 align:start position:0%
itself
um

04:51:34.010 --> 04:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:37.368 --> 04:51:37.378 align:start position:0%
the way by which the funds are raised
 
04:51:39.708 --> 04:51:39.718 align:start position:0%
the fact that it will
 
04:51:42.650 --> 04:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
the testimony we heard will impact our
 
04:51:45.650 --> 04:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
charitable uh Charities that get
 
04:51:47.090 --> 04:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
serviced through a charitable gaming
 
04:51:49.730 --> 04:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
model at present
 
04:51:49.740 --> 04:51:50.810 align:start position:0%
model at present
um

04:51:50.810 --> 04:51:50.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:53.570 --> 04:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
basically the bill needs a lot of work
 
04:51:55.430 --> 04:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
we can revisit this in the future but we
 
04:51:57.650 --> 04:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
shouldn't jump into the deep end of the
 
04:51:57.660 --> 04:51:58.610 align:start position:0%
shouldn't jump into the deep end of the
pool

04:51:58.610 --> 04:51:58.620 align:start position:0%
pool
 
04:52:01.910 --> 04:52:01.920 align:start position:0%

bill
 
04:55:54.288 --> 04:55:54.298 align:start position:0%
um it's a common sense bill that would

eliminate unnecessary background checks
 
04:55:58.610 --> 04:55:58.620 align:start position:0%
for those who are not intimately
 
04:56:02.330 --> 04:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
involved in in the game of chance and so
 
04:56:04.070 --> 04:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
therefore it will eliminate background
 
04:56:07.990 --> 04:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:10.128 --> 04:56:10.138 align:start position:0%

uh from Senator Susie by Senator
 
04:56:21.230 --> 04:56:21.240 align:start position:0%

on and that was to increase the amount
 
04:56:33.590 --> 04:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
of money that the Charities are allowed
 
04:56:37.550 --> 04:56:37.560 align:start position:0%

all volunteers
 
04:56:42.770 --> 04:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
when they are doing the work that is
 
04:56:45.948 --> 04:56:45.958 align:start position:0%
required by our law to be done to make
 
04:56:48.010 --> 04:56:48.020 align:start position:0%
the bingo games work
 
04:56:50.590 --> 04:56:50.600 align:start position:0%

04:57:04.850 --> 04:57:04.860 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:57:07.190 --> 04:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
um they believe will
 
04:57:11.090 --> 04:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
increase the ability of people who need
 
04:57:14.750 --> 04:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
babysitters who are coming from a little
 
04:57:17.270 --> 04:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
distance and are going to have to miss
 
04:57:19.368 --> 04:57:19.378 align:start position:0%
dinner if they
 
04:57:22.850 --> 04:57:22.860 align:start position:0%
don't have enough money to pay for
 
04:57:25.850 --> 04:57:25.860 align:start position:0%
for a meal on the way in
 
04:57:25.860 --> 04:57:26.690 align:start position:0%
for a meal on the way in
um

04:57:26.690 --> 04:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:30.470 --> 04:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
that it allows them to have the
 
04:57:33.650 --> 04:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
volunteers to have more bingo games
 
04:57:36.288 --> 04:57:36.298 align:start position:0%
we have been regarding Bingo as a dying
 
04:57:39.770 --> 04:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
industry but this is Apparently one of
 
04:57:41.990 --> 04:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
the problems that inflation has caught
 
04:57:42.000 --> 04:57:42.948 align:start position:0%
the problems that inflation has caught
up

04:57:42.948 --> 04:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:57:45.830 --> 04:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
with their ability to attract the
 
04:57:45.840 --> 04:57:47.590 align:start position:0%
with their ability to attract the
volunteers

04:57:47.590 --> 04:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
04:57:52.788 --> 04:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
and on it was introduced to us and a
 
04:57:56.270 --> 04:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
number of us wanted to be able to add it
 
04:57:59.208 --> 04:57:59.218 align:start position:0%
on to this bill they thought that the
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
rest of the Senate would be Senator
 
04:58:03.650 --> 04:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald thought that the rest of the
 
04:58:06.288 --> 04:58:06.298 align:start position:0%
Senate would be willing to go along with
 
04:58:08.448 --> 04:58:08.458 align:start position:0%
that but we don't have anything from the
 
04:58:11.150 --> 04:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
rest of the senate about it
 
04:58:13.670 --> 04:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
just a friendly reminder I right now
 
04:58:15.288 --> 04:58:15.298 align:start position:0%
we're doing the ought to pass motion on
 
04:58:17.690 --> 04:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
Cinema 119. do we have an amendment that
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
someone wants to move do we have an
 
04:58:21.650 --> 04:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
amendment all the only amendment we have
 
04:58:23.750 --> 04:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
at the moment and I'd hoped that we'd be
 
04:58:25.310 --> 04:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
able to discuss whether we were going to
 
04:58:28.670 --> 04:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
do this today or not on is
 
04:58:32.208 --> 04:58:32.218 align:start position:0%
um the one from Senator Susie usually
 
04:58:35.208 --> 04:58:35.218 align:start position:0%
when we have work sessions we talk about
 
04:58:37.670 --> 04:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
the Amendments we've been given and then
 
04:58:41.208 --> 04:58:41.218 align:start position:0%
we go and and vote on them the next week
 
04:58:44.868 --> 04:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
after we've redone the amendments but
 
04:58:46.850 --> 04:58:46.860 align:start position:0%
um the way we're doing it now we don't
 
04:58:49.910 --> 04:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do that I'm going to
 
04:58:51.590 --> 04:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
ask a parliamentary question to see if
 
04:58:55.550 --> 04:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
anyone has an answer on this and that is
 
04:58:55.560 --> 04:58:56.208 align:start position:0%
anyone has an answer on this and that is
um

04:58:56.208 --> 04:58:56.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:58.610 --> 04:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
if Senator Susie did an amendment can we
 
04:59:00.110 --> 04:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
just use that Amendment if someone wants
 
04:59:01.670 --> 04:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
to move that amount I don't believe that
 
04:59:05.690 --> 04:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
we can it's a a senate amendment number
 
04:59:07.490 --> 04:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
we have to have our own amendment number
 
04:59:09.730 --> 04:59:09.740 align:start position:0%
to pass it okay
 
04:59:12.170 --> 04:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
there's a gentleman way in the back
 
04:59:13.970 --> 04:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
there okay if you're answering the
 
04:59:15.288 --> 04:59:15.298 align:start position:0%
Parliamentary question otherwise this is
 
04:59:16.910 --> 04:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
not a public hearing this is an exact
 
04:59:16.920 --> 04:59:18.530 align:start position:0%
not a public hearing this is an exact

04:59:18.530 --> 04:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
session
 
04:59:24.250 --> 04:59:24.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:27.230 --> 04:59:27.240 align:start position:0%

opening up for public testimony then we
 
05:00:10.010 --> 05:00:10.020 align:start position:0%

05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
to it going on consent
 
05:10:05.760 --> 05:10:07.690 align:start position:0%
to it going on consent
okay

05:10:07.690 --> 05:10:07.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:10:09.948 --> 05:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
we will now close the executive session
 
05:10:12.890 --> 05:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
on Senate bill 139.
 
05:10:17.810 --> 05:10:17.820 align:start position:0%

05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
the exec session on Senate Bill 191
 
05:10:48.050 --> 05:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
relative Road total registration
 
05:10:50.330 --> 05:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
surcharges for electric vehicles and the
 
05:10:51.650 --> 05:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
 
05:10:53.810 --> 05:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
spilsbury for a motion thank you madam
 
05:10:59.690 --> 05:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
chair I move retain on HB 191. excuse me
 
05:11:03.650 --> 05:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
SB 191. is there a second
 
05:11:07.070 --> 05:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
oh representative soti seconds it uh
 
05:11:09.170 --> 05:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
would you care to speak to your motion
 
05:11:11.810 --> 05:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
05:11:14.090 --> 05:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
I think that there's a broad consensus
 
05:11:18.170 --> 05:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
that there's a genuine problem to solve
 
05:11:20.628 --> 05:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
and that is how will electric vehicles
 
05:11:22.850 --> 05:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
contribute to the maintenance of roads
 
05:11:24.830 --> 05:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
and bridges in the state of New
 
05:11:24.840 --> 05:11:25.850 align:start position:0%
and bridges in the state of New
Hampshire

05:11:25.850 --> 05:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:11:28.128 --> 05:11:28.138 align:start position:0%
but there's a wide variety of potential
 
05:11:29.868 --> 05:11:29.878 align:start position:0%
ways of doing that
 
05:11:31.670 --> 05:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
and each one represents a bit of a
 
05:11:31.680 --> 05:11:32.810 align:start position:0%
and each one represents a bit of a
conundrum

05:11:32.810 --> 05:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
conundrum
 
05:11:35.930 --> 05:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
so this is a a classic bill that really
 
05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
deserves more attention
 
05:11:40.010 --> 05:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
then we can give it this season
 
05:11:43.190 --> 05:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
I would also note that uh
 
05:11:47.990 --> 05:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
I was a co-sponsor on HP 456
 
05:11:51.350 --> 05:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
which was referred to house Public Works
 
05:11:54.590 --> 05:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
and highways and that bill has been
 
05:11:57.230 --> 05:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
retained by Public Works
 
05:11:59.570 --> 05:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
the purpose of that bill is to address
 
05:12:01.670 --> 05:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
the very same problem in an entirely
 
05:12:04.310 --> 05:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
different way by looking at the
 
05:12:06.590 --> 05:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
potential of taxing the charging
 
05:12:06.600 --> 05:12:08.390 align:start position:0%
potential of taxing the charging
activity

05:12:08.390 --> 05:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
activity
 
05:12:11.810 --> 05:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
so this bill I think
 
05:12:14.750 --> 05:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
deserves the time possibly even some
 
05:12:16.670 --> 05:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
coordination with one or more other
 
05:12:19.010 --> 05:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
committees to come up with a solution
 
05:12:23.208 --> 05:12:23.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:25.730 --> 05:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
comments representative Olney
 
05:12:29.810 --> 05:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:32.448 --> 05:12:32.458 align:start position:0%
study committee I believe it is that
 
05:12:35.448 --> 05:12:35.458 align:start position:0%
went from the house to the Senate
 
05:12:35.458 --> 05:12:37.850 align:start position:0%
went from the house to the Senate
to

05:12:37.850 --> 05:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:12:40.970 --> 05:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
to continue the study that was being
 
05:12:44.510 --> 05:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
done last year but in the second year
 
05:12:46.550 --> 05:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
commit study committees don't get much
 
05:12:46.560 --> 05:12:48.350 align:start position:0%
commit study committees don't get much
done

05:12:48.350 --> 05:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:12:50.690 --> 05:12:50.700 align:start position:0%
um on this
 
05:12:53.090 --> 05:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh maybe someone else remembers better
 
05:12:56.750 --> 05:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
the numbers but on
 
05:13:00.948 --> 05:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
we need that kind of study
 
05:13:04.430 --> 05:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
and as you said we need it in between
 
05:13:04.440 --> 05:13:06.050 align:start position:0%
and as you said we need it in between
different

05:13:06.050 --> 05:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:13:06.060 --> 05:13:07.430 align:start position:0%
different
different

05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:13:09.830 --> 05:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
um people from
 
05:13:12.288 --> 05:13:12.298 align:start position:0%
it could be environment and agriculture
 
05:13:16.190 --> 05:13:16.200 align:start position:0%
or natural resources it could be uh
 
05:13:19.730 --> 05:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
on but it's something that we was set up
 
05:13:23.330 --> 05:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:26.150 --> 05:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
two terms ago and then we had the covid
 
05:13:29.810 --> 05:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
problems and then one term ago and
 
05:13:35.330 --> 05:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
um it ended up as I recall meeting once
 
05:13:37.788 --> 05:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
or twice and not getting the work done
 
05:13:37.798 --> 05:13:41.030 align:start position:0%
or twice and not getting the work done
and

05:13:41.030 --> 05:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:44.448 --> 05:13:44.458 align:start position:0%
and then this term going forward to the
 
05:13:46.128 --> 05:13:46.138 align:start position:0%
Senate and
 
05:13:49.070 --> 05:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters thought that they were
 
05:13:51.530 --> 05:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
going to pass it but
 
05:13:55.190 --> 05:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
I was told that the Senate was retaining
 
05:13:57.948 --> 05:13:57.958 align:start position:0%
it to see what we do with this effort of
 
05:13:57.958 --> 05:13:59.690 align:start position:0%
it to see what we do with this effort of
theirs

05:13:59.690 --> 05:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
theirs
 
05:14:04.190 --> 05:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
and I would very much like to not retain
 
05:14:07.670 --> 05:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
this bill while we find out
 
05:14:09.890 --> 05:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
where we are with the Senate on that
 
05:14:11.570 --> 05:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
because we've been trying to work on
 
05:14:13.368 --> 05:14:13.378 align:start position:0%
this issue for 10 years and the
 
05:14:16.090 --> 05:14:16.100 align:start position:0%
situation gets worse and worse for
 
05:14:19.310 --> 05:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
transportation and we haven't done
 
05:14:21.470 --> 05:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
anything yet and this is regarded as a
 
05:14:24.288 --> 05:14:24.298 align:start position:0%
kind of stop Gap measure to help the
 
05:14:27.410 --> 05:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
bleeding and stop having to take Finance
 
05:14:29.930 --> 05:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
having to take money out of the general
 
05:14:32.930 --> 05:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
fund to pay for transportation
 
05:14:32.940 --> 05:14:34.430 align:start position:0%
fund to pay for transportation
um

05:14:34.430 --> 05:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:38.810 --> 05:14:38.820 align:start position:0%
so since we have the time it is not an
 
05:14:40.030 --> 05:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
early Bill
 
05:14:43.788 --> 05:14:43.798 align:start position:0%
we could retain it until next week while
 
05:14:45.230 --> 05:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
05:14:47.990 --> 05:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
tries to find out what's happening in
 
05:14:49.250 --> 05:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
05:14:52.208 --> 05:14:52.218 align:start position:0%
or the vice chair
 
05:14:56.150 --> 05:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:58.310 --> 05:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
let's see if the representatives can has
 
05:15:01.810 --> 05:15:01.820 align:start position:0%
finished her remarks okay representative
 
05:15:04.670 --> 05:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
represent Alma used the word retain till
 
05:15:06.350 --> 05:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
next week I don't think that's retained
 
05:15:07.970 --> 05:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
I think we just continue the hearing
 
05:15:09.470 --> 05:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
continue the hearing
 
05:15:09.480 --> 05:15:11.050 align:start position:0%
continue the hearing
yeah

05:15:11.050 --> 05:15:11.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:18.288 --> 05:15:18.298 align:start position:0%
no um
 
05:15:20.810 --> 05:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
we we now have a motion before us which
 
05:15:23.090 --> 05:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
we will need to vote on and I will just
 
05:15:25.610 --> 05:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
make a comment what I heard in this is
 
05:15:27.470 --> 05:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
obviously a very very important topic we
 
05:15:28.730 --> 05:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
know many committees and many
 
05:15:30.110 --> 05:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
commissions have been looking at this
 
05:15:31.910 --> 05:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
issue for many years and they have not
 
05:15:33.708 --> 05:15:33.718 align:start position:0%
been able to come up with a solution
 
05:15:36.530 --> 05:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're gonna we have the
 
05:15:38.330 --> 05:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
all of the information we need I don't
 
05:15:40.010 --> 05:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
think we have the time that we need to
 
05:15:42.410 --> 05:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
do this Justice at this time so I do
 
05:15:43.850 --> 05:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
believe that retained motion is
 
05:15:46.310 --> 05:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate but we'll see where the vote
 
05:15:47.208 --> 05:15:47.218 align:start position:0%
goes and we'll go from there
 
05:15:50.208 --> 05:15:50.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh first I need to say that um
 
05:15:57.590 --> 05:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
that I have electric vehicles and uh so
 
05:15:59.690 --> 05:15:59.700 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be voting speaking and
 
05:16:02.030 --> 05:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
voting on this bill
 
05:16:04.128 --> 05:16:04.138 align:start position:0%
um and that needs to be understood
 
05:16:06.708 --> 05:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
that's my obligation to say that and
 
05:16:10.490 --> 05:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
then I will be supporting the
 
05:16:13.128 --> 05:16:13.138 align:start position:0%
retain motion
 
05:16:15.110 --> 05:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh
 
05:16:18.110 --> 05:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated issue and if we can
 
05:16:20.510 --> 05:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
make progress on this in this committee
 
05:16:22.670 --> 05:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
let's do so
 
05:16:25.010 --> 05:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
um and either gain Clarity on the
 
05:16:28.430 --> 05:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
particular proposal that's before us or
 
05:16:32.750 --> 05:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
adjust it which we can do over the
 
05:16:34.970 --> 05:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
course of the next several months so
 
05:16:37.368 --> 05:16:37.378 align:start position:0%
I'll be supporting this
 
05:16:39.530 --> 05:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey
 
05:16:41.868 --> 05:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh correct me if
 
05:16:43.550 --> 05:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but it's my understanding that
 
05:16:45.530 --> 05:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
when a bill is retained by committee
 
05:16:47.930 --> 05:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily mean nothing
 
05:16:51.110 --> 05:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
happens it just merely means we're
 
05:16:53.208 --> 05:16:53.218 align:start position:0%
maintaining possession of the bill
 
05:16:55.368 --> 05:16:55.378 align:start position:0%
through the remainder of this year
 
05:16:59.030 --> 05:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
through the summer and into January and
 
05:17:01.490 --> 05:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
even in January we can continue work
 
05:17:04.430 --> 05:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
sessions mixed in with our regular work
 
05:17:05.990 --> 05:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
if we have any
 
05:17:06.000 --> 05:17:07.490 align:start position:0%
if we have any
right

05:17:07.490 --> 05:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:17:07.500 --> 05:17:08.330 align:start position:0%
right
um

05:17:08.330 --> 05:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:10.368 --> 05:17:10.378 align:start position:0%
so it's not really
 
05:17:13.730 --> 05:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
putting it aside it's just
 
05:17:17.270 --> 05:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
think main maintaining possession of the
 
05:17:19.850 --> 05:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
bill so we can work on it is that
 
05:17:19.860 --> 05:17:21.650 align:start position:0%
bill so we can work on it is that
correct

05:17:21.650 --> 05:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:17:24.770 --> 05:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
absolutely we can start working on a we
 
05:17:27.110 --> 05:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
can work on a retained Bill anytime we
 
05:17:28.610 --> 05:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
want we couldn't after we get through
 
05:17:29.990 --> 05:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
some of our deadlines and start working
 
05:17:31.730 --> 05:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
on it this spring or we could wait to
 
05:17:34.610 --> 05:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
the fall any individual member of this
 
05:17:36.590 --> 05:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
committee can certainly keep working on
 
05:17:38.628 --> 05:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
it with all stakeholders and for the
 
05:17:40.910 --> 05:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
record I want to be an electric vehicle
 
05:17:40.920 --> 05:17:41.868 align:start position:0%
record I want to be an electric vehicle
owner

05:17:41.868 --> 05:17:41.878 align:start position:0%
owner
 
05:17:43.788 --> 05:17:43.798 align:start position:0%
okay who else we have over here
 
05:17:46.190 --> 05:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative homie I just want to
 
05:17:48.470 --> 05:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
correct something the retained bills
 
05:17:52.250 --> 05:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
have to be voted on by late October I
 
05:17:54.708 --> 05:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
believe it is and then they go to the
 
05:17:56.810 --> 05:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
floor and we lose control over it at
 
05:17:59.990 --> 05:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
that point it goes to the floor and it
 
05:18:02.628 --> 05:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
and it can go to the floor as referred
 
05:18:04.490 --> 05:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
to interim study which means we put it
 
05:18:06.970 --> 05:18:06.980 align:start position:0%
off for yet another year
 
05:18:11.690 --> 05:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
on and I mean and if that causes the
 
05:18:14.628 --> 05:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:19.070 --> 05:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
and and uh refuse the commission then
 
05:18:21.948 --> 05:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
we've got a real problem but
 
05:18:25.788 --> 05:18:25.798 align:start position:0%
um there is a uh the reason Foundation
 
05:18:27.948 --> 05:18:27.958 align:start position:0%
which reached out to me and which is
 
05:18:29.990 --> 05:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
working with with
 
05:18:30.000 --> 05:18:30.610 align:start position:0%
working with with
um

05:18:30.610 --> 05:18:30.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:33.890 --> 05:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
legislators legislatures in other parts
 
05:18:37.430 --> 05:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
of this country on this issue which had
 
05:18:39.830 --> 05:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
never reached out to New Hampshire
 
05:18:42.170 --> 05:18:42.180 align:start position:0%
before and
 
05:18:45.470 --> 05:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
um for some reason reason former
 
05:18:47.810 --> 05:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
representative sumsitch with whom I
 
05:18:51.288 --> 05:18:51.298 align:start position:0%
disagreed on this quite a lot uh told
 
05:18:52.850 --> 05:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
them to talk to me
 
05:18:56.330 --> 05:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
so I have now sent that to Waters and
 
05:18:59.990 --> 05:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
can can send it to the committee too but
 
05:19:03.050 --> 05:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
there is an experiment which he this guy
 
05:19:06.350 --> 05:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
is very fond of that's original that's
 
05:19:08.750 --> 05:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
in Virginia right now that's just
 
05:19:12.770 --> 05:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
started so but the problem is every year
 
05:19:14.690 --> 05:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
we're getting further behind on the
 
05:19:21.788 --> 05:19:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:24.110 --> 05:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
okay other comments representative
 
05:19:26.810 --> 05:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you madam chair
 
05:19:28.730 --> 05:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
um I disagree with several of my
 
05:19:31.550 --> 05:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
colleagues here I don't see this as a
 
05:19:34.368 --> 05:19:34.378 align:start position:0%
very difficult challenging bill
 
05:19:37.010 --> 05:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
it's one that simply says that we're
 
05:19:40.128 --> 05:19:40.138 align:start position:0%
asking electric vehicle owners to pay
 
05:19:44.150 --> 05:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
for the use of the roads that they use
 
05:19:46.910 --> 05:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
and they are not paying for them through
 
05:19:48.890 --> 05:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
a gas tax I don't see this as
 
05:19:51.230 --> 05:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
complicated so I will be voting against
 
05:19:51.240 --> 05:19:53.510 align:start position:0%
complicated so I will be voting against
retaining

05:19:53.510 --> 05:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
retaining
 
05:19:55.610 --> 05:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative orrs and I'm sorry I
 
05:19:57.530 --> 05:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
missed you we'll go to your neck thank
 
05:20:00.050 --> 05:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
you madam chair so I tend to agree with
 
05:20:01.788 --> 05:20:01.798 align:start position:0%
representative all me I think we've
 
05:20:04.970 --> 05:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
kicked this can down the road forever I
 
05:20:06.770 --> 05:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
think I don't see it as very difficult
 
05:20:10.010 --> 05:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
either it's like I'm not sure why we're
 
05:20:12.410 --> 05:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
I'm all in favor of a hundred dollars on
 
05:20:14.448 --> 05:20:14.458 align:start position:0%
the electric vehicles or two hundred
 
05:20:16.610 --> 05:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
dollars or three hundred dollars the
 
05:20:18.050 --> 05:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
road you know the roads got to be
 
05:20:19.850 --> 05:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
repaired I don't like driving through
 
05:20:22.610 --> 05:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
potholes either so thank you
 
05:20:24.650 --> 05:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
representative janigan
 
05:20:26.810 --> 05:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair well I'll I'll
 
05:20:28.610 --> 05:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
give you another reason why you may want
 
05:20:31.570 --> 05:20:31.580 align:start position:0%
to retain it and that is the 20
 
05:20:34.250 --> 05:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
that would go to the state to build out
 
05:20:34.260 --> 05:20:35.690 align:start position:0%
that would go to the state to build out
infrastructure

05:20:35.690 --> 05:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
05:20:38.570 --> 05:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
really doesn't make sense we didn't the
 
05:20:40.550 --> 05:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
state didn't build out gasoline stations
 
05:20:42.170 --> 05:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
I don't believe the state should be
 
05:20:45.410 --> 05:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
building out uh charging stations
 
05:20:48.948 --> 05:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
however I'm not I want to retain it for
 
05:20:50.750 --> 05:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
that reason but off also for the reason
 
05:20:54.410 --> 05:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
it is complex as a member of Public
 
05:20:57.410 --> 05:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
Works and highways seven years ago and I
 
05:20:59.930 --> 05:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
know prior to then this bill comes up or
 
05:21:01.730 --> 05:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
this type of Bill comes up in in public
 
05:21:04.610 --> 05:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
works and highways every single year
 
05:21:06.590 --> 05:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
um they have not found a solution to it
 
05:21:06.600 --> 05:21:08.150 align:start position:0%
um they have not found a solution to it
yet

05:21:08.150 --> 05:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
yet
 
05:21:10.670 --> 05:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
that and we do need to find one and
 
05:21:12.948 --> 05:21:12.958 align:start position:0%
maybe that does rest I think as
 
05:21:14.750 --> 05:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury may have said
 
05:21:16.490 --> 05:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
you know at some point it'd be nice if
 
05:21:19.250 --> 05:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
we could charge just like we charge the
 
05:21:22.190 --> 05:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
gas tax at the gas station charge an
 
05:21:25.128 --> 05:21:25.138 align:start position:0%
electric tax potentially at the charging
 
05:21:26.570 --> 05:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
station once we figure out how to do
 
05:21:28.730 --> 05:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
that but anyways this is a complex bill
 
05:21:30.170 --> 05:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be solved in the next
 
05:21:33.050 --> 05:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
week or two it has some flaws so it
 
05:21:34.910 --> 05:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be passed as is so I would say
 
05:21:37.010 --> 05:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
we need to retain at this point thank
 
05:21:37.020 --> 05:21:37.910 align:start position:0%
we need to retain at this point thank
you

05:21:37.910 --> 05:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:21:40.310 --> 05:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
other comments representative fellows I
 
05:21:41.930 --> 05:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
I think it's about time that we send
 
05:21:43.670 --> 05:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
this to the Full House and let them vote
 
05:21:45.470 --> 05:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
on it and
 
05:21:50.090 --> 05:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
um I I do see that 20 percent
 
05:21:53.990 --> 05:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
can be up to 20 can be retained by
 
05:21:56.330 --> 05:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
Transportation but it's up to so it
 
05:21:58.910 --> 05:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they have to hold on
 
05:22:01.868 --> 05:22:01.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:04.190 --> 05:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
other comments from Members
 
05:22:05.810 --> 05:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
representative elberger
 
05:22:07.550 --> 05:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:22:07.560 --> 05:22:08.390 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

05:22:08.390 --> 05:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:11.930 --> 05:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
one of the advantages that an electric
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
car owner can be to charge their
 
05:22:17.990 --> 05:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles at home if they have power that
 
05:22:22.128 --> 05:22:22.138 align:start position:0%
work that works for that and we can't go
 
05:22:24.708 --> 05:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
into people's homes and say tell us what
 
05:22:27.350 --> 05:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
percentage of your electric bill is
 
05:22:29.510 --> 05:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
related to charging your car and we're
 
05:22:32.930 --> 05:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
going to tax you on that so we can't
 
05:22:37.730 --> 05:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
easily say that well we can do the a
 
05:22:40.190 --> 05:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
parallel with the gas tax
 
05:22:42.730 --> 05:22:42.740 align:start position:0%
on an electrical
 
05:22:47.690 --> 05:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
charging setup so I I that doesn't make
 
05:22:50.750 --> 05:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
sense to me and I again reiterate
 
05:22:54.670 --> 05:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:57.288 --> 05:22:57.298 align:start position:0%
and let's ask the electric vehicle
 
05:23:00.530 --> 05:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
owners who have not been paying for any
 
05:23:03.170 --> 05:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
kind of support of the roads for as long
 
05:23:06.948 --> 05:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
as electric vehicles have been used in
 
05:23:08.868 --> 05:23:08.878 align:start position:0%
this state let's ask them to pay their
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
Fair shift
 
05:23:10.440 --> 05:23:13.490 align:start position:0%
Fair shift
representative

05:23:13.490 --> 05:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:16.190 --> 05:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair you raise a good
 
05:23:17.810 --> 05:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
point I mean that that is a problem
 
05:23:20.330 --> 05:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
however that's that what that's one of
 
05:23:21.830 --> 05:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
the things that makes this so complex
 
05:23:24.128 --> 05:23:24.138 align:start position:0%
because what about all the Massachusetts
 
05:23:27.470 --> 05:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh drivers that are coming up Route 95
 
05:23:30.650 --> 05:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
Route 93 and Route 3 every single day
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
and especially on the weekends and
 
05:23:35.390 --> 05:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
holidays they won't they're not they're
 
05:23:37.670 --> 05:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
not paying anything so but if we could
 
05:23:39.948 --> 05:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
charge them at charging stations at
 
05:23:41.810 --> 05:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
least out of state and it's it's not
 
05:23:42.770 --> 05:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
going to all follow New Hampshire
 
05:23:44.570 --> 05:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
drivers I'm not saying that's the
 
05:23:46.250 --> 05:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
complete solution it's not that's why
 
05:23:49.850 --> 05:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
it's complex but um again I think retain
 
05:23:52.550 --> 05:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
is in order
 
05:23:54.110 --> 05:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative Ames did you want to
 
05:23:55.550 --> 05:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
comment any further
 
05:23:58.550 --> 05:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh anyone else would like to
 
05:23:58.560 --> 05:23:59.868 align:start position:0%
okay uh anyone else would like to
comment

05:23:59.868 --> 05:23:59.878 align:start position:0%
comment
 
05:24:02.208 --> 05:24:02.218 align:start position:0%
okay the motion before us is retain
 
05:24:05.750 --> 05:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 191 and the clerk will call
 
05:24:08.810 --> 05:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
the roll on retain
 
05:24:10.730 --> 05:24:10.740 align:start position:0%

sold and the chair recognizes
 
05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%

05:27:17.650 --> 05:27:17.660 align:start position:0%

uh representative all me seconds that
 
05:27:22.250 --> 05:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
for the record I am involved in the
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
turbo gaming industry representative
 
05:27:25.730 --> 05:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
Roche would you like to speak to your
 
05:27:28.610 --> 05:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you madam chair uh
 
05:27:31.670 --> 05:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 192 really is a you know for
 
05:27:34.670 --> 05:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term it's uh it's a
 
05:27:37.368 --> 05:27:37.378 align:start position:0%
cleanup bill I mean it it it it matches
 
05:27:40.788 --> 05:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
Uh current law with when bingo games can
 
05:27:40.798 --> 05:27:42.170 align:start position:0%
Uh current law with when bingo games can
operate

05:27:42.170 --> 05:27:42.180 align:start position:0%
operate
 
05:27:44.030 --> 05:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
um with Lucky 7 tickets we heard
 
05:27:47.570 --> 05:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh a number of bingo uh
 
05:27:50.750 --> 05:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
facilities have run two games multiple
 
05:27:52.970 --> 05:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
games during the day and they start
 
05:27:54.770 --> 05:27:54.780 align:start position:0%
early in the morning
 
05:27:56.150 --> 05:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
um but the way the law is currently
 
05:28:00.288 --> 05:28:00.298 align:start position:0%
written the Lucky Seven ticket sales are
 
05:28:04.010 --> 05:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh limited somewhat are quite quite
 
05:28:07.430 --> 05:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
limited and therefore the Charities that
 
05:28:09.708 --> 05:28:09.718 align:start position:0%
that could be benefiting fully are not
 
05:28:13.730 --> 05:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
benefiting fully from their sale so uh I
 
05:28:15.288 --> 05:28:15.298 align:start position:0%
think it just makes sense to match that
 
05:28:18.410 --> 05:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
with the current Bingo laws
 
05:28:20.690 --> 05:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
representable me
 
05:28:24.470 --> 05:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
if I could the current law is that they
 
05:28:26.868 --> 05:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
aren't allowed to do this before I
 
05:28:31.910 --> 05:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
forget whether it's noon or 1 pm noon on
 
05:28:31.920 --> 05:28:33.170 align:start position:0%
forget whether it's noon or 1 pm noon on
but

05:28:33.170 --> 05:28:33.180 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
the actual situation
 
05:28:40.310 --> 05:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
for a long time was that they were doing
 
05:28:40.320 --> 05:28:41.330 align:start position:0%
for a long time was that they were doing
it

05:28:41.330 --> 05:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:28:43.910 --> 05:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
and they were doing a game in the
 
05:28:46.850 --> 05:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
morning and a game in the afternoon and
 
05:28:49.730 --> 05:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
before the game started people would
 
05:28:54.350 --> 05:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
come in and have coffee and socialize uh
 
05:28:56.330 --> 05:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
and that's when they were buying the
 
05:28:58.250 --> 05:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
Lucky Seven tickets
 
05:28:58.260 --> 05:28:59.750 align:start position:0%
Lucky Seven tickets
and

05:28:59.750 --> 05:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:29:02.750 --> 05:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
there was a restructuring at Lottery
 
05:29:04.868 --> 05:29:04.878 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:29:07.730 --> 05:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
current head of
 
05:29:10.010 --> 05:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
of charitable gaming which was brought
 
05:29:12.110 --> 05:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
into lot lottery
 
05:29:15.410 --> 05:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
on at the time was
 
05:29:15.420 --> 05:29:16.730 align:start position:0%
on at the time was
um

05:29:16.730 --> 05:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:20.030 --> 05:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
found that this was in rules
 
05:29:25.550 --> 05:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
and moved last year to put it into law
 
05:29:28.550 --> 05:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
just so people would see it and what
 
05:29:32.090 --> 05:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
that resulted in was a number of
 
05:29:37.550 --> 05:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
normal bingo games being uh cut in half
 
05:29:40.250 --> 05:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
in places that had been doing this all
 
05:29:43.070 --> 05:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
along I don't understand why we ever
 
05:29:46.010 --> 05:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
said Bingo should go to 1am I can't
 
05:29:49.310 --> 05:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
imagine it ever has but
 
05:29:52.788 --> 05:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
um we don't want to have to amend that
 
05:29:55.610 --> 05:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
for this purpose but
 
05:29:59.448 --> 05:29:59.458 align:start position:0%
um those Charities are generally I think
 
05:30:02.990 --> 05:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
the the smaller ones because they have a
 
05:30:05.030 --> 05:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
great deal of socialization going on
 
05:30:06.730 --> 05:30:06.740 align:start position:0%
during the day
 
05:30:10.310 --> 05:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
particularly in the morning hours and
 
05:30:12.948 --> 05:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
they're losing more than half of their
 
05:30:14.868 --> 05:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
revenue actually
 
05:30:17.150 --> 05:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
because of this
 
05:30:17.160 --> 05:30:18.788 align:start position:0%
because of this
so

05:30:18.788 --> 05:30:18.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:30:23.090 --> 05:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:25.970 --> 05:30:25.980 align:start position:0%

uh
 
05:35:02.288 --> 05:35:02.298 align:start position:0%

but in fact by
duplicating

05:35:04.070 --> 05:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
duplicating
 
05:35:07.430 --> 05:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
almost duplicating the language that
 
05:35:11.750 --> 05:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
already exists in the law and on
 
05:35:11.760 --> 05:35:13.190 align:start position:0%
already exists in the law and on
it

05:35:13.190 --> 05:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:35:16.128 --> 05:35:16.138 align:start position:0%
creates a situation in which there could
 
05:35:21.590 --> 05:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
be major confusion on in
 
05:35:23.448 --> 05:35:23.458 align:start position:0%

the
on

05:35:26.230 --> 05:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:35:30.708 --> 05:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
rules applied by dra
 
05:35:34.310 --> 05:35:34.320 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:35:42.350 --> 05:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
the committee believes that
 
05:35:42.360 --> 05:35:44.150 align:start position:0%
the committee believes that
that

05:35:44.150 --> 05:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:35:46.368 --> 05:35:46.378 align:start position:0%
adding the word
 
05:35:48.530 --> 05:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
custom well maybe I should put in that
 
05:35:52.788 --> 05:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
part about guard rails but but adding
 
05:35:55.010 --> 05:35:55.020 align:start position:0%

05:36:13.680 --> 05:36:16.010 align:start position:0%
all right however many years ago it was
now

05:36:16.010 --> 05:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:16.020 --> 05:36:16.690 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:36:16.690 --> 05:36:16.700 align:start position:0%

05:36:22.390 --> 05:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
2012 on to make it
 
05:36:26.350 --> 05:36:26.360 align:start position:0%

proprietorships and
um

05:36:35.990 --> 05:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:39.770 --> 05:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
the addition of the word customary
 
05:36:43.610 --> 05:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
without guard guard rails in a separate
 
05:36:43.620 --> 05:36:44.628 align:start position:0%
without guard guard rails in a separate
section

05:36:44.628 --> 05:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:36:47.270 --> 05:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to work on this but in a
 
05:36:50.628 --> 05:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
separate section does
 
05:36:50.638 --> 05:36:51.470 align:start position:0%
separate section does
um

05:36:51.470 --> 05:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:54.410 --> 05:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
for a number of accountants and lawyers
 
05:36:58.128 --> 05:36:58.138 align:start position:0%
consulted create confusion
 
05:36:58.138 --> 05:36:59.570 align:start position:0%
consulted create confusion
uh

05:36:59.570 --> 05:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:37:01.868 --> 05:37:01.878 align:start position:0%
in the law and
 
05:37:06.110 --> 05:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
that is why I think that we ought to
 
05:37:09.830 --> 05:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:11.510 --> 05:37:11.520 align:start position:0%

business profits tax
 
05:37:16.310 --> 05:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
um representative yes we heard testimony
 
05:37:19.368 --> 05:37:19.378 align:start position:0%
from dra that this is not necessary and
 
05:37:21.530 --> 05:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's harmful because it adds another
 
05:37:23.570 --> 05:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
word which is confusion when you do
 
05:37:25.368 --> 05:37:25.378 align:start position:0%
something like that people think there's
 
05:37:27.530 --> 05:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
something new there and there isn't so
 
05:37:30.890 --> 05:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
just wind up confusing people
 
05:37:33.050 --> 05:37:33.060 align:start position:0%

an amendment on Senate Bill 19 and we

will schedule
 
05:39:55.550 --> 05:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
a hearing on that Amendment just to make
 
05:39:57.410 --> 05:39:57.420 align:start position:0%

appreciate your participation
 
05:40:18.350 --> 05:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
representative Platt the amendment uh we
 
05:40:19.850 --> 05:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
have to have a hearing on because it's
 
05:40:21.770 --> 05:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
slightly different section but we're
 
05:40:24.910 --> 05:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
extending the hours of bingo to 16 hours
 
05:40:29.690 --> 05:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
uh 16 days rather so this would extend
 
05:40:33.230 --> 05:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
Lucky Seven for the same 16 days but
 
05:40:35.510 --> 05:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's because it's a different section of
 
05:40:37.250 --> 05:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
the same law we have to have a public
 
05:40:42.708 --> 05:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:51.230 --> 05:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:53.628 --> 05:40:53.638 align:start position:0%
I do have an amendment for Senate Bill
 
05:40:58.430 --> 05:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
112 which on I in the hearing I heard
 
05:41:00.590 --> 05:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
someone else talking about an amendment
 
05:41:04.850 --> 05:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
too so I'm not sure mine should be
 
05:41:10.490 --> 05:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
drafted by now but it hadn't come out
 
05:41:12.230 --> 05:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
anyone who's interested in Senate Bill
 
05:41:15.350 --> 05:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
112 please come to the work session if
 
05:41:18.590 --> 05:41:18.600 align:start position:0%

05:41:20.510 --> 05:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
amendment please find a Committee Member

um this one we'll see if we can get it
 
05:41:27.590 --> 05:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
done does create a dedicated fund for
 
05:41:31.730 --> 05:41:31.740 align:start position:0%

05:41:47.990 --> 05:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
fund at this point is
 
05:41:51.350 --> 05:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
um controlled by a group that I just
 
05:41:52.970 --> 05:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
found out about after I did the
 
05:41:57.230 --> 05:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
amendment but that on the finance
 
05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
committee sends money to the Council on
 
05:42:02.230 --> 05:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
problem gaming but it is
 
05:42:07.070 --> 05:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:10.850 --> 05:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
so I need to go back now that there's
 
05:42:14.570 --> 05:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
time and talk to lbao about okay is
 
05:42:16.670 --> 05:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
there any kind of problem in creating a
 
05:42:19.510 --> 05:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund that is
 
05:42:23.350 --> 05:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to to Lottery
 
05:42:25.970 --> 05:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
which they all of them are attached to
 
05:42:28.670 --> 05:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
some department or other
 
05:42:28.680 --> 05:42:29.570 align:start position:0%
some department or other
um

05:42:29.570 --> 05:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:29.580 --> 05:42:31.128 align:start position:0%
um
and

05:42:31.128 --> 05:42:31.138 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:42:31.138 --> 05:42:32.948 align:start position:0%
and
on

05:42:32.948 --> 05:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:42:36.708 --> 05:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
that would would come from the fees
 
05:42:39.650 --> 05:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
inside the lottery itself which is what
 
05:42:41.270 --> 05:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
the bill is doing
 
05:42:46.490 --> 05:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
but the idea was to try to of the of the
 
05:42:49.490 --> 05:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
sponsor as I understand it was mostly to
 
05:42:55.010 --> 05:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
try to to put more money into that
 
05:42:58.490 --> 05:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
um that Council so that there would be
 
05:43:04.010 --> 05:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
more uh work done on problem gaming
 
05:43:07.430 --> 05:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
and the language that I I have so that
 
05:43:11.030 --> 05:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:14.090 --> 05:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
says that the purpose of the fund would
 
05:43:16.670 --> 05:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
be to Pro to provide funding for
 
05:43:18.770 --> 05:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
identification and treatment of problem
 
05:43:18.780 --> 05:43:21.470 align:start position:0%
identification and treatment of problem

05:43:23.690 --> 05:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:43:29.150 --> 05:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:31.730 --> 05:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
I've I've got to look up the council for
 
05:43:34.250 --> 05:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
problem game gaming and see whether it
 
05:43:36.470 --> 05:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
has purpose or not
 
05:43:37.970 --> 05:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
