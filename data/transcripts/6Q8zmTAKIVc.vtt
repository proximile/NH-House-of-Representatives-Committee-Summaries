00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
create a new chapter detailing a
 
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
consumer expectation of privacy
 
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
as you all know we have a constitutional
 
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
amendment concerning privacy so it is
 
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
something that is vitally important to
 
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
the people in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
and today people produce 25 times the
 
00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 align:start position:0%
online data they did in 2010 recording
 
00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
just about every single aspect of their
 
00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
everyday life
 
00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire citizens today have no
 
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
rights to control their personal data
 
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
and businesses have no obligations to
 
00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 align:start position:0%
Steward the data they hold
 
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
or respect the wishes of consumers when
 
00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 align:start position:0%
they ask that their personal information
 
00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 align:start position:0%
not be distributed or what they want
 
00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.310 align:start position:0%
not be distributed or what they want
deleted

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
deleted
 
00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 255 will establish the
 
00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
rights of consumers to protect their
 
00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 align:start position:0%
data and the responsibility of
 
00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 align:start position:0%
businesses they deal with to respect
 
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
their customers privacy wishes
 
00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 align:start position:0%
this bill grants all of us the consumer
 
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
the right to access correct delete and
 
00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
obtain a copy of personal data and gives
 
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
us rights to opt out of the processing
 
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
of our personal data for certain
 
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.969 align:start position:0%
of our personal data for certain
purposes

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
it also establishes a framework for
 
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 align:start position:0%
controlling and processing personal data
 
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
and establishes responsibilities and
 
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
private privacy protection standards for
 
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
the various businesses that control and
 
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
or process our personal data
 
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 255 is modeled after
 
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
legislation that has passed in Virginia
 
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
Colorado and Connecticut and in this
 
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 align:start position:0%
legislative session this model has
 
00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
passed one body in Texas and Montana and
 
00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
is very close to being enacted in
 
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
Indiana having passed both bodies
 
00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
this model has been evaluated and worked
 
00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 align:start position:0%
on by many of the same stakeholders and
 
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
industries that do business here in New
 
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.410 align:start position:0%
industries that do business here in New
Hampshire

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
this bill is comprehensive it covers a
 
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
lot of material which is the result of
 
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
years of work and discussions all of
 
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
which is necessary to provide rights for
 
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
consumers while minimizing disruption to
 
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.949 align:start position:0%
consumers while minimizing disruption to
Commerce

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 align:start position:0%
Commerce
 
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 align:start position:0%
it has a thorough definition section
 
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
clearly establishes consumer rights
 
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
creates obligations on the part of
 
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.369 align:start position:0%
creates obligations on the part of
controllers

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 align:start position:0%
controllers
 
00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
who are those who have the relationship
 
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
with the consumer and obligations for
 
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
processors are those who process data on
 
00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 align:start position:0%
behalf of the controllers
 
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
it is time that the state of New
 
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire acts to provide rights to
 
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
Consumers to control their personal data
 
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
held by businesses and this legislation
 
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
is a meaningful first step in
 
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
establishing those rights Mr chairman at
 
00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
this point I think I've kind of given an
 
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
overview of the bill
 
00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 align:start position:0%
um as and as you know it is
 
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of material in here and
 
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
there are experts here that have worked
 
00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 align:start position:0%
on this legislation that would be able
 
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
to answer very detailed technical
 
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
questions that I don't have the ability
 
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
to answer so I would just say thank you
 
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
very much and I appreciate your time and
 
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
your consideration on this Bill thank
 
00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman great thank you did
 
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for the
 
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
senator given what she said yes um Mr
 
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
chair I don't necessarily have questions
 
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
for the senator but I have questions for
 
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
the people following the senator if if
 
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
that's true no no that's exactly I think
 
00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
we all probably have questions thank you
 
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
very much I'm sure you do Mr chairman
 
00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you all very much again
 
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
for your time and I appreciate it oh you
 
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
do want to ask a question I was just
 
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
going to ask general questions that
 
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
maybe people following could answer but
 
00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
I could wait until they get up if that's
 
00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 align:start position:0%
okay whatever works oh no I I didn't
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
want to stop you from asking questions
 
00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
if you did but all right all right I
 
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
think we're all set thank you thank you
 
00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 align:start position:0%
again Mr chairman all right
 
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
um I know Senator Susie um I don't think
 
00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 align:start position:0%
she's here now she indicated she had a
 
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
conflict if um if we see her come in I
 
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
may take her out of order but um uh next
 
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
I'm going to represent uh recognize
 
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 align:start position:0%

representative Luna co-sponsor of the
bill

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 align:start position:0%

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
folks are welcome to drop in anytime
 
00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
we're always over there so um so they're
 
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
only letting us letting me out briefly
 
00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
uh this morning
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
um but um but I agree with uh with with
 
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
everything that Senator Carson just um
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh just laid out as far as the the
 
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
rationale behind uh introduction of this
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
legislation there is no protection of um
 
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
of of
 
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information uh
 
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
in codified in New Hampshire statute so
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
this is a meaningful first step I think
 
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
as she described it to um uh to bring us
 
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
there but a little bit of history and um
 
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 align:start position:0%
and uh representative Kirk I think we'll
 
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
we'll also be talking a little bit about
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
some of the history here we we have
 
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
different positions when it comes to to
 
00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 align:start position:0%
this bill but um but um but Neil and I
 
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
have uh have spent a considerable amount
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
of time together working on these issues
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
and similar issues and back in 2019 uh
 
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
we were we were both members of a study
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
committee uh following an earlier Bill
 
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
along with representative hunt and
 
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Kavanaugh and um and as a result
 
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
of that study committee we um uh we
 
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
introduced House Bill 536 uh which is
 
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
really directed to um to protecting
 
00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
privacy of biometric you know data that
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
that is collected and um and 536 is very
 
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
very different than this bill it um uh
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
it was uh first of all it was only maybe
 
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
a half a page long as opposed to I don't
 
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
know what we're here like 20 Pages or
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
something I don't have it right in front
 
00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:36.259 align:start position:0%
of me at the moment but but 536
 
00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
provided a
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
basically modified the consumer
 
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
protection act 350 a day to give
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
consumers a private right of action
 
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
should they feel that they're um that
 
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 align:start position:0%
their privacy rights had been violated
 
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
by a um uh by by a company they were
 
00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
doing business with and um and that bill
 
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
actually passed it was recommended out
 
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
to pass 20 nothing out of the Commerce
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
Committee and they hardly ever do that
 
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
and um uh and passed on a Voice vote on
 
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
the on the floor of the house it was
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
later retained in the Senate but uh but
 
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
I liked it quite a bit because
 
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
um because it did provide for that
 
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
private right of action under 358a it
 
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
also allowed the Department of Justice
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
to uh to proceed to protect a consumer's
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
right when it came to violations of
 
00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
their their personally identifiable
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
information so SB 255 doesn't go that
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
far it limits the the action to the
 
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:41.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice
 
00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:45.419 align:start position:0%
but but more importantly I think it's
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
very specific and it's very
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
comprehensive in terms of what
 
00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information is
 
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
what the biometric data is and and what
 
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
constitutes a violation of of someone's
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
privacy rights and what um and it also
 
00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:04.259 align:start position:0%
sets some standards for uh for companies
 
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
for businesses to comply with those
 
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
privacy rights and why is that important
 
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
um so again going back to the work that
 
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
we did in 2019 our committee researcher
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
Pam smarling actually
 
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:21.020 align:start position:0%
provided us with several reports
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
based on what companies and at the time
 
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
were doing as far as privacy notices so
 
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
so this goes to page nine line 16-26 of
 
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
the uh of the bill
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
with respect to privacy notices and why
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
is this important because companies like
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
ancestry and 23andMe had privacy notices
 
00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
that were 15 pages long in one case 18
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
pages long in another case and buried
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
um you know in some cases you know
 
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
starting on page 40 of a um of a of a of
 
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
an agreement with the customer and I
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
think you know most of us have have um
 
00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
have either purchased some technology
 
00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:08.459 align:start position:0%
whether that's a uh you know uh you know
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
piece of internet technology or or um or
 
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
or a camera or even a car nowadays where
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
where you have to agree with privacy
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
notices before you can um you know can
 
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
proceed so having some Stan and does
 
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
everybody read them well I would expect
 
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
in the Judiciary Committee everybody's
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
going to read the Privacy notices but
 
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
but as far as the consumers who were
 
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.810 align:start position:0%
but as far as the consumers who were
protecting

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
um my guess is probably many of them
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
don't so having some guard rails down to
 
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
make sure that companies are providing
 
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
clearly understood and clearly
 
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
recognized privacy notices that are easy
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
to get to right at the top of uh of an
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
agreement is uh is is really important
 
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
for for Consumer Protection so like I
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
say this doesn't have everything that
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
that house bill 536 had in it but it's
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
got a lot more provides I think more
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
definition and uh and certainly is a is
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
a very good first step to codifying uh
 
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
privacy rights in New Hampshire so
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
thanks for that I think there's probably
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that are that are be
 
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
able to answer more technical questions
 
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to take any any questions
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
from any members of the committee
 
00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
I guess representative I just have one
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
question and it may and it may be that
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
other people could answer this more
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
fully than you but just just generally
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
since you have been involved in this for
 
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
a while do is there the the main thing
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
that I had as a concern and I'm not I'm
 
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that I'm opposed to the
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
to the bill but the one thing that I did
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
sort of concern me was is the
 
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
is the cutoff of what businesses are
 
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.650 align:start position:0%
is the cutoff of what businesses are
covered

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
covered
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
um is it are you satisfied that the
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
cutoff of I think it's a hundred
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
thousand account that that's appropriate
 
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
should it be higher are we is there some
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
is there some chance that we would be
 
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.329 align:start position:0%
is there some chance that we would be
um

00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:02.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
imposing sort of undue burdens on
 
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses that that's really my
 
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
goal yeah so that's a that's a that's a
 
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
really good question and and you know I
 
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
think the cut line is appropriate on um
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh on that and I think the the
 
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
exclusions that uh that the bill makes
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
are also appropriate because we do have
 
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
some some statute that does protect um
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh personally identify information when
 
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
collected by government agencies
 
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:31.019 align:start position:0%
departments schools things like things
 
00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:32.339 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
um and um and that was certainly one of
 
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:37.820 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we had back in 2019
 
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
and uh and and the bill that was
 
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
introduced back then did not establish
 
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
any cut line nor
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
provide any guidelines to um to
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
companies and businesses on what to put
 
00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:56.459 align:start position:0%
in in their contracts so uh but but it
 
00:12:00.889 --> 00:12:00.899 align:start position:0%
but it it exposed those businesses to
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
what the consumer
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
um felt was what they agreed to when you
 
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
know signing up for ancestry.com or
 
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
23andMe or whatever it happened to be so
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
so I so I I think this this you know you
 
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959 align:start position:0%
could probably wiggle that cut line
 
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
around based on how the um uh the
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
committee feels but but I think it does
 
00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:23.630 align:start position:0%
committee feels but but I think it does
establish

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
establish
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh guard rails that um uh that that
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
clearly Define what um you know what's
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
what's expected and as Senator Carson
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
said it is being used in other states
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
right now and um and and companies are
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
complying with uh with this now this
 
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
just clearly puts it now you know as
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
rights protected in um in New Hampshire
 
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.449 align:start position:0%
rights protected in um in New Hampshire
law

00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:47.459 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you uh other questions for this
 
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.850 align:start position:0%
thank you uh other questions for this
Witness

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:51.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.509 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks um actually just following
 
00:12:58.129 --> 00:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
up on the question that you just asked
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
um when I was reading this I was
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
wondering in this section
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
was it intended that this be a hundred
 
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
thousand consumers within New Hampshire
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
or 25 000 within New Hampshire or in
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
their entire scope of of uh business
 
00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:14.459 align:start position:0%
yeah not the great question that one's
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
beyond my pay grade so so um I I think
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
the um the the folks here from some of
 
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
the companies who have who who have
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
testified on this bill in other states
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
as well that have that have adopted uh
 
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
this language could clarify that
 
00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:31.139 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
00:13:31.139 --> 00:13:33.290 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
Horgan

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
Horgan
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
thank you of course there's a lot of um
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of apps which use uh
 
00:13:41.449 --> 00:13:41.459 align:start position:0%
personal data you know you basically you
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
give them at least a limited set of your
 
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
personal data in exchange for the
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
service like today I of course it was
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
probably unnecessary because you think I
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
would know my how to get here by now but
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
I use for example ways to
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
um to on my way to the uh on the way to
 
00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:57.959 align:start position:0%
the state house which then keeps track
 
00:13:57.959 --> 00:13:59.090 align:start position:0%
the state house which then keeps track
of

00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
keep track of where I am hopefully
 
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
hopefully de-identify in a way that
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
would be hard for a hacker to to steal
 
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
and then partially of course they had
 
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
the attendees it had the implications of
 
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
all the other cars on the road for the
 
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
purpose of telling me what the traffic
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
conditions were and then also frankly
 
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
apparently even though oddly ever paying
 
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:19.820 align:start position:0%
attention to him the occasionally
 
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
so that there's a question yeah so will
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
these services like that still be able
 
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
to operate where their business model
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
will still be able to work um if if we
 
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
pass this law yeah yeah I I think so and
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan I I I think so and
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
I think what you've the examples that
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
you've you've laid out here actually
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
illustrate why a law like this is so
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
important because um you know as and you
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
know I mentioned earlier even when when
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of new cars you have to
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
agree with their privacy agreement
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
before you can even use them but but as
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
as automobiles become more advanced and
 
00:14:59.569 --> 00:14:59.579 align:start position:0%
drive themselves they need to know where
 
00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
they're going they know where you are
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
they're collecting that date that that
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
data along the way from the time you
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
leave your driveway or in front of your
 
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
house to the time you get where where
 
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
you're going and um and and it it's it's
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
another example of of how personally
 
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
identified data is being and and is
 
00:15:20.449 --> 00:15:20.459 align:start position:0%
being collected by companies and is
 
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
being used by companies to improve
 
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
products to get you places safely and
 
00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:28.019 align:start position:0%
things like that and uh and and it's
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
going to be essential you can't even use
 
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
some of these products without without
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
agreeing and and agreeing to that data
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
being collected so um so uh uh you know
 
00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:40.139 align:start position:0%
I think you know in the end of the day
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's um it's going to make our products
 
00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:44.339 align:start position:0%
better it's going to make people safer
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
and um and and you know and companies
 
00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:49.019 align:start position:0%
are going to they're really going to
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
have to comply with this
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much thank
 
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on uh uh
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Sean philiot am I
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
pronouncing that correctly
 
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is representative
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
Sean filio I represent the residents of
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
Chester Chester district 7 which covers
 
00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:25.139 align:start position:0%
Keane's Ward 2.
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
as has already been covered this bill
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
would provide New Hampshire residents
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
with important digital privacy rights
 
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to discuss what
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
this bill would do and what it wouldn't
 
00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:37.970 align:start position:0%
this bill would do and what it wouldn't
do

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
this bill would help New Hampshire
 
00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
residents to join the residence of a
 
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
number of other states enjoying digital
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
privacy rights which already exist in
 
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
those States
 
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
important to mention here is California
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
this bill has existed for a number of
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
years in California and why that matters
 
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
is that anywhere that a California
 
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
resident could potentially engage in
 
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
digital Commerce this bill applies so if
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
a business could potentially reach a
 
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
California resident
 
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
that business has already needed to
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
comply with this law
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
so if that business could potentially
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
reach a California resident that
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
business for years now has already had
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
to pull it put into place the digital
 
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
architecture to comply with this that is
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
to find somebody within its online
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
database to be able to give that person
 
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
a copy of their digital information and
 
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
then to excise that digital information
 
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
if somebody needed it now this bill only
 
00:17:57.529 --> 00:17:57.539 align:start position:0%
applies to larger online businesses that
 
00:17:59.690 --> 00:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
is an online business that has the reach
 
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
of a hundred thousand people or an
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
online business that has a reach of 25
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
000 people but at least a quarter of his
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
business is engaging in the creation of
 
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
online information
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
so to answer the first question if this
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
applies to businesses with a reach of a
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand people that is a
 
00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand people in the aggregate
 
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
but at least one of those would hit in
 
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
this bill a New Hampshire resident or in
 
00:18:33.169 --> 00:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
the case of the California Bill a
 
00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
California resident
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
so in the case of the California Bill
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
why that matters is virtually every
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
single large online business
 
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
would have the potential of hitting a
 
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
California resident because it's our
 
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
nation's largest state economy
 
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
so they've already had to comply
 
00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:54.539 align:start position:0%
therefore this bill is asking for
 
00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
nothing new of these businesses
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
because they've already been complying
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
we're just asking now that New Hampshire
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
joined the list of states that allows
 
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
their residents to be able to ask that
 
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
they have digital privacy rights
 
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
and these are important rights
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
if you go online and you buy something
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
you've created a digital Trail
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
these businesses know something about
 
00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:26.990 align:start position:0%
these businesses know something about
you

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
've given your email address but it
 
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
doesn't end there
 
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
the business then follows you online you
 
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
create digital breadcrumbs because it
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop at that website
 
00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
they follow you online beyond that
 
00:19:42.179 --> 00:19:43.190 align:start position:0%
they follow you online beyond that
website

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
you started by buying a pair of shoes
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
but then
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
you go to a recipe website
 
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
that shoe website follows you to the
 
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
recipe website and then you go to your
 
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.299 align:start position:0%
news website whichever News website you
 
00:19:57.299 --> 00:19:58.370 align:start position:0%
news website whichever News website you
prefer

00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
prefer
 
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
they know about that too and it
 
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.150 align:start position:0%
they know about that too and it
continues

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
continues
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
if you'd prefer that that information
 
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
not be kept or if you at least want to
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
know your digital breadcrumbs this bill
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
is the way to get that information
 
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
or to delete that information
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
other states residents have that right
 
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
and we're requesting the New Hampshire
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
residents have that right too
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
the ability to get that information and
 
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
to delete that information already
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
exists for these large businesses
 
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
we're not asking so that something
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
newbie created we're asking that New
 
00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:38.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents get that right too
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
now this is only for large businesses
 
00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:45.299 align:start position:0%
we're not asking that the small local
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
coffee shop that happens to have a
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
website be required to do this this is
 
00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:54.419 align:start position:0%
for large businesses only
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
so you're a small business doesn't need
 
00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
is it possible that a new business may
 
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
be captured within the scope of this
 
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.730 align:start position:0%
be captured within the scope of this
bill

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.289 align:start position:0%
bill
yes

00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:06.299 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:07.490 align:start position:0%
yes
but

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
the ability the architecture to be able
 
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
to comply with this already exists there
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
are already now a number of businesses
 
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
that help businesses to comply with this
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
so the ability to comply with this bill
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
already exists there are digital
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
custodians that could help businesses to
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
be able to comply with this readily
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
because fortunately we are now following
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
another State's footsteps so the ability
 
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
to comply with this bill is readily
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
available we're not creating something
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
new we fortunately have the advantage of
 
00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
following in other states footsteps
 
00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take any questions that
 
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative Schmidt
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair
 
00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that these large
 
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
entities have the ability
 
00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.310 align:start position:0%
entities have the ability
to

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
answer those requests
 
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
in States X Y and Z including California
 
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
but would refuse to answer that request
 
00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.870 align:start position:0%
but would refuse to answer that request
if

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:21.299 align:start position:0%
it came from someone in one of the 40
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
plus states where they do not have this
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
law are they going to
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
say control the traffic and say yes
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
we'll answer your request but no we
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
won't answer
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
another request
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
question that would be their option to
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not to comply with the
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
request in the 40-something states that
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
do not currently have this in place it
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
become ultimately a business decision as
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
to whether they decided to comply with
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
that request or not
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
I think would be a poor business
 
00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
decision but it's a business is a
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
decision not a legal decision thank you
 
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
other questions for this one yes
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander um thank you Mr
 
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
chair I have a number of questions but
 
00:23:09.649 --> 00:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
I'm going to save those I have one
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
question specifically where in the build
 
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
does it say applies to businesses with a
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand people or less where
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
can you just point to the language
 
00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
it's section 507 H2
 
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
um per second
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
that is it thank you and the technical
 
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
know-how we both uh I think have the
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
same question my technical know-how is
 
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
oh okay uh representative Stapleton I
 
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
think you had a question
 
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
these uh digital breadcrumbs is that the
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
same as the cookies that we can control
 
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
clean out and eliminate off of our
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
computer or is that another Factor
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh that part of that would be that
 
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
digital know-how that I do not have part
 
00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:06.299 align:start position:0%
of that would be cookies and as you will
 
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
see many websites ask you whether or not
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
you want them to collect cookies
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
that is part of actually their
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
compliance with the California law which
 
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
has required you to opt in or opt out of
 
00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.210 align:start position:0%
has required you to opt in or opt out of
cookies

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
cookies
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
that is fortunately part of that
 
00:24:21.409 --> 00:24:21.419 align:start position:0%
California and all law now that is that
 
00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:24.059 align:start position:0%
they're complying with uh and part of it
 
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:27.740 align:start position:0%
is your creation and deletion of cookies
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh that you can opt in or opt out of but
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
it goes beyond that as well um and there
 
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
are people who are more digitally savvy
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
than me that are sitting behind me you
 
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
can also probably answer that better
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
than I can
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
yes follow up
 
00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:45.419 align:start position:0%
so the cookies are the front end that we
 
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:48.539 align:start position:0%
can control we're given notice on but
 
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
these digital breadcrumbs are kind of
 
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
like in the background in a database
 
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
reserved in the cloud whatever that and
 
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill is trying to
 
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
penetrate for our control to
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative in part and
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
I would and then as I've said there are
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
people behind me who will be able to
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
give more digital know-how but uh
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
they we would there are elements to this
 
00:25:15.169 --> 00:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
Beyond just simply cookies that are
 
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
collected as well even something as
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
simple as you entering your email
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
address into a website you'd be able to
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
ask that they no longer have that as
 
00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:23.390 align:start position:0%
ask that they no longer have that as
well

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:25:24.769 --> 00:25:24.779 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's a great representative Terror
 
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
yeah just um I think this is a general
 
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.669 align:start position:0%
yeah just um I think this is a general
question

00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
what would trigger this since it is the
 
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's option to to pursue
 
00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:39.539 align:start position:0%
um something under this is does there
 
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
need to be a back-end system for people
 
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
to sort of report what they think are
 
00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
violations of this or or is there going
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
to be some sort of a a process for
 
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
um reporting or somehow uh certifying
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
that you're complying with this
 
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.299 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I follow the question
 
00:25:59.330 --> 00:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
and sorry if maybe it doesn't make sense
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
but I I was wondering uh since it is the
 
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
right of the State Attorney General to
 
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
pursue actions under this this law
 
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
what do you foresee being the trigger
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
that sort of creates that is there is
 
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
there a new mechanism for consumers to
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
file complaints or is the attorney is
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
there a reporting mechanism I was just
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
curious like how you envisioned this
 
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
sort of raising to the level where that
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
would actually happen
 
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for representative so there
 
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
are a number of provisions of the law uh
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
what I focused on here are the digital
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
are the consumers digital privacy rights
 
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
one of which could be that if simply a
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
digital custodian were to foolishly
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
refuse to comply with a
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
a consumer's request a consumer could
 
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
report that to the attorney general
 
00:26:48.409 --> 00:26:48.419 align:start position:0%
which would be a violation of the
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
state's consumer protection act at which
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
point the cons attorney general would be
 
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
able to decide whether to pursue that or
 
00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
not I think it's unlikely the Attorney
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
General would pursue a single violation
 
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
but it would then go into the Attorney
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
General's information and uh repeated
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
violations may be pursued as well uh
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
for example another provision of the
 
00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
bill is that a
 
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
digital custodian also needs to
 
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
make make aware that if whether or not
 
00:27:20.049 --> 00:27:20.059 align:start position:0%
they are giving information to
 
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
advertising information to third parties
 
00:27:24.769 --> 00:27:24.779 align:start position:0%
if a website were not to comply with
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
that provision the Attorney General
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
could pursue that as well as a violation
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
of the consumer protection act so
 
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
different versions of the ACT if the
 
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
Attorney General believed that it were
 
00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:36.419 align:start position:0%
to rise to the threshold of unfair and
 
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
deceptive practices if it were to be
 
00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
egregious enough or repetitive enough
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and his discretion
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
could decide to pursue that
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:55.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
uh the the question I would have is how
 
00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
would the consumer
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
communicate with the digital
 
00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
processor or whatever you you call these
 
00:28:09.659 --> 00:28:12.590 align:start position:0%
processor or whatever you you call these
companies

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.169 --> 00:28:15.179 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative each
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
company would have a different means of
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
being able to uh communicate with them
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
some may do it through email or an
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
online form or you could simply go
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
through the traditional method of Simply
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
writing a letter as I've seen it done
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
through the California act typically
 
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
it's an online form or email
 
00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:37.220 align:start position:0%
follow up go ahead
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
is is that
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
method of communication specified
 
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
somewhere in this bill
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
not that I see it in the bill because it
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
does provide not specifying when the
 
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
bill does allow for that leeway for the
 
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
company to decide what is best for that
 
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
company it also allows the consumer to
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
have that leeway to provide what the
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
consumer prefers as best for that
 
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
consumer if a consumer were to want to
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
write a letter simply because they don't
 
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
want to have any further digital
 
00:29:06.529 --> 00:29:06.539 align:start position:0%
communication with the company that
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
would provide that leeway as well
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
uh thank you other questions yes
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative divine
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
um there was a company recently on that
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
well-known company uh that was held
 
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.909 align:start position:0%
well-known company uh that was held
accountable

00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
um in in one of these cases where it was
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
I think selling
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
um people's information or passing it
 
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
along so then they would end up
 
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
receiving emails ads what have you and
 
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
they were kind of going against us how
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
would a consumer be able to
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
um you know if they know that they're
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
getting xsa emails and they opted out of
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
something and they were getting
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
how would they be able to
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
stop that from happening even though
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
they might have opt out is there
 
00:30:00.409 --> 00:30:00.419 align:start position:0%
anything in this that would help the
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
consumer to be able to opt out of those
 
00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
things or who do they reach out to if
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
it's not in the terms and conditions on
 
00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:09.299 align:start position:0%
the company's site
 
00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for representative this would
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
at least provide a first step to the
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
consumer to be able to understand where
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
their digital information had gone by
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
tracking their digital trail from at
 
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
least one digital custodian to
 
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
understand how their information had
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
been used
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't stop everything in its
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
tracks but it would be an important
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
first step
 
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%

next gonna call on uh Ryan Harkins uh
 
00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.049 --> 00:30:53.059 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:01.140 align:start position:0%
correct is that working thank you my
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
apologies uh good morning Mr chair and
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Ryan
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
Harkins I am senior director of public
 
00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
policy with Microsoft and I'd like to
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
we support SB 255 and we would encourage
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
you to pass it
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
we at Microsoft have long taken privacy
 
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.330 align:start position:0%
we at Microsoft have long taken privacy
seriously

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
and we have been at this for some time
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
we first started calling for a federal
 
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:30.899 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Privacy Law in this
 
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
country in 2005.
 
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
and 18 years later we still find
 
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
ourselves with no federal law on the
 
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
books and with much of the rest of the
 
00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.529 align:start position:0%
books and with much of the rest of the
world

00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
world
 
00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:45.539 align:start position:0%
racing ahead to regulate data protection
 
00:31:48.409 --> 00:31:48.419 align:start position:0%
and privacy and Technology
 
00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:51.059 align:start position:0%
and as technology has become
 
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
increasingly important in all of our
 
00:31:54.889 --> 00:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
lives and as the amount of data that is
 
00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
being generated about each and every one
 
00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
of us has grown
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
it has become clear that there are real
 
00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
and serious concerns that the public has
 
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
about what all of that means for our
 
00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.190 align:start position:0%
about what all of that means for our
privacy

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:12.539 align:start position:0%
and it's also clear
 
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
that the public has lost trust in
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
technology and in the technology
 
00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.310 align:start position:0%
technology and in the technology
industry

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
and in our view
 
00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:24.299 align:start position:0%
there is an urgent need to pass new laws
 
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
in order to help start earn that trust
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
back laws that would both provide
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
consumers with the rights that are
 
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
necessary to control their personal data
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
and laws that would provide clear rules
 
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
of the road to business and to Industry
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
to allow us to continue to innovate with
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
certainty and with confidence and so for
 
00:32:48.169 --> 00:32:48.179 align:start position:0%
several years
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
we have been supporting efforts in the
 
00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.769 align:start position:0%
we have been supporting efforts in the
states

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
which in the absence of leadership from
 
00:32:57.769 --> 00:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
Congress have have stepped up to start
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
passing privacy laws to provide their
 
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
constituents with protections
 
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.510 align:start position:0%
constituents with protections
um

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
there are in our view
 
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
a number of components that need to be
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
part of any Privacy Law
 
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure that it will both
 
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
provide business with clear rules of the
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
road while also providing consumers with
 
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
real incredible protections
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
this bill contains those things first
 
00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:33.059 align:start position:0%
it is important to have strong
 
00:33:33.059 --> 00:33:34.610 align:start position:0%
it is important to have strong
definitions

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
and in particular it is important to
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
ensure that the definitions of data that
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
will be covered by the bill and that
 
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
will not be covered by the bill
 
00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:44.870 align:start position:0%
will not be covered by the bill
um

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
ensure that the bill will apply to the
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
kinds of modern online data sets that
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
are used to track and Target consumers
 
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.389 align:start position:0%
are used to track and Target consumers
today

00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
that means that the definition of
 
00:33:57.649 --> 00:33:57.659 align:start position:0%
personal data for instance needs to
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
cover not just identified data
 
00:34:03.649 --> 00:34:03.659 align:start position:0%
meaning data associated with say your
 
00:34:03.659 --> 00:34:04.370 align:start position:0%
meaning data associated with say your
name

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
or your mailing address or even your
 
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
email address
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
but identifiable data
 
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
data that can identify you indirectly
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
because it is stored in association with
 
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
a cookie ID
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
or an IP address
 
00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
or some other form of persistent unique
 
00:34:21.899 --> 00:34:23.649 align:start position:0%
or some other form of persistent unique
identifier

00:34:23.649 --> 00:34:23.659 align:start position:0%
identifier
 
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
this bill has strong definitions that in
 
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
our view would ensure that it will apply
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
to Modern online data sets that are used
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
to track and Target each and every one
 
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
of us on the internet
 
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
second it has to provide consumers with
 
00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:42.899 align:start position:0%
the rights that are necessary to empower
 
00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:45.419 align:start position:0%
them to control their personal data
 
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
that means the right to transparency to
 
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
know and confirm that companies are
 
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
collecting personal data about you the
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
right to access your personal data the
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
right to correct it the right to delete
 
00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.870 align:start position:0%
right to correct it the right to delete
it

00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:02.839 align:start position:0%
the right to Port it in other words to
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
take your personal data if you are doing
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
business with Microsoft and you decide
 
00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
that you want to do business with
 
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
another company to take the data that
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
you have provided to us and take it to a
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
different company
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
it also means uh the right to consent to
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
different forms of data processing in
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
this bill like other laws that have
 
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
passed across the country
 
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.140 align:start position:0%
takes an appropriately nuanced approach
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
to consent it would both provide
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
consumers with the right to opt out
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
of certain sensitive processing
 
00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
activities meaning the collection
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
sharing and use of your personal data
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
for data sales for targeted advertising
 
00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
for certain types of automated profiling
 
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
it would also require companies at a
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
certain point to allow consumers to
 
00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
exercise those rights with something
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
that you can think of as an easy button
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
so meaning some people refer to this as
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
a global privacy control or a universal
 
00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:08.220 align:start position:0%
opt-out signal
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
but the idea is that you could go to
 
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
your web browser
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
or onto your phone and click a button at
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
one place and one time
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
and opt out of those activities for
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
every website that you will visit across
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
the internet rather than requiring
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
consumers to go to every single website
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
to exercise that right individually
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
it also would provide consumers with
 
00:36:33.849 --> 00:36:33.859 align:start position:0%
opt-in consent rights
 
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
requiring companies to obtain opt-in
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
consent in order to collect share and
 
00:36:43.329 --> 00:36:43.339 align:start position:0%
use sensitive data so data like
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
Biometrics or geolocation information
 
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
so providing consumers with rights to
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
control their data
 
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.650 align:start position:0%
control their data
third

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
third
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
it would impose affirmative obligations
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
on companies irrespective of whether
 
00:36:59.930 --> 00:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
consumers actually exercise rights
 
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
to be responsible stewards of the data
 
00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
they collect
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
and that would include obligations like
 
00:37:06.119 --> 00:37:08.510 align:start position:0%
and that would include obligations like
transparency

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
data minimization
 
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
the obligation to provide appropriate
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
and reasonable security safeguards and
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
also the obligation to conduct and
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
document risk assessments of data
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
processing activities that may give rise
 
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
to an increased risk of harm to
 
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.210 align:start position:0%
to an increased risk of harm to
Consumers

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
Consumers
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
and those assessments well they the
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
topic may seem dry and boring they are
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
in our view an important component of
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
privacy laws because they will require
 
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
companies to professionalize the way
 
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
they treat data
 
00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:47.339 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they are being thoughtful
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
about their data processing activities
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
to engage in good data hygiene
 
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
and they will provide if you will a road
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
map for the Attorney General a peek
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
under the hood if you will as to what
 
00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:02.339 align:start position:0%
companies are actually doing with data
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
and those assessments will need to be
 
00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:06.140 align:start position:0%
made available to the attorney general
 
00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
upon request if they are relevant to an
 
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.470 align:start position:0%
upon request if they are relevant to an
investigation

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.230 align:start position:0%
investigation
so

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
in conclusion I would thank you for your
 
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.069 align:start position:0%
in conclusion I would thank you for your
leadership

00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
um and your your interest in attempting
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
to move this issue forward
 
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
um again we support the bill we would
 
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
encourage you to pass it and with that
 
00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:29.579 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to try and answer any
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
questions you may have questions for
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
this week is representative page thank
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I have a real Hardball
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
question did you submit written
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and I apologize if I missed it
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
I have not my apologies I have not
 
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony but I will
 
00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:44.339 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
um with a copy of my remarks to submit
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Alexander
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
my question I'm looking at um page five
 
00:38:59.569 --> 00:38:59.579 align:start position:0%
um line six section two the following
 
00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
information data shall be exempt from
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
this chapter I'm looking all the way at
 
00:39:05.569 --> 00:39:05.579 align:start position:0%
K uh collection maintenance disclosure
 
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
sale communication any personal
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
information being bearing on a
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
customer's credit worthiness credit
 
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
standing credit capacity but then it
 
00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:14.660 align:start position:0%
goes to character General reputation
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
personal characteristic or mode of
 
00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.050 align:start position:0%
personal characteristic or mode of
living

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
living
 
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
by consumer reporting I guess I'm
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
wondering like in what way would
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
Microsoft need to have or have
 
00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
information exempt from this chapter
 
00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
that has to do with the consumer's
 
00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
character General General reputation
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
well I would say with respect to all of
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
these exemptions in section that section
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
two like these are not exemptions that
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
we are taking a position on these aren't
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions we are asking for these
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
aren't exemptions we're opposing
 
00:39:50.569 --> 00:39:50.579 align:start position:0%
um based on our reading of the bill
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
the rights and obligations in the bill
 
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
would apply to Microsoft in our
 
00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.870 align:start position:0%
would apply to Microsoft in our
activities

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
part of the challenge in attempting to
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
pass a comprehensive Privacy Law like
 
00:40:03.119 --> 00:40:04.069 align:start position:0%
pass a comprehensive Privacy Law like
this

00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
is that the United States for decades
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
has taken a very different approach to
 
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
data protection and privacy than what
 
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
this bill and and other laws like in
 
00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.170 align:start position:0%
this bill and and other laws like in
California

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:17.180 align:start position:0%
California
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
Virginia Colorado Connecticut Utah and
 
00:40:23.329 --> 00:40:23.339 align:start position:0%
now Iowa have have passed
 
00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
for decades the United States has taken
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
a laissez-faire approach to privacy and
 
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
data protection but we have had narrow
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
sector specific or industry-specific
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
privacy laws on the books so you're
 
00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:37.619 align:start position:0%
pointing to one the Fair Credit
 
00:40:40.609 --> 00:40:40.619 align:start position:0%
Reporting Act we've also have the Grammy
 
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
bliley act which applies to privacy in
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
the financial sector we have HIPAA and
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
the high tech act which applies to
 
00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:49.619 align:start position:0%
privacy in the healthcare industry we
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
even have you know something called the
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
children's online privacy protection act
 
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
or Kappa
 
00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
which addresses the collection of
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
personal information from kids under 13
 
00:40:59.099 --> 00:41:00.950 align:start position:0%
personal information from kids under 13
online

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
that approach is very different from the
 
00:41:05.089 --> 00:41:05.099 align:start position:0%
approach that our friends in the
 
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
European Union have long taken
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
in which they have dating all the way
 
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
back to 1995 when they enacted something
 
00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
called the data protection directive
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
have had a broad comprehensive approach
 
00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:18.980 align:start position:0%
to privacy and data protection
 
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
so in one place in one law by and large
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
they apply and address all privacy
 
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
issues across all Industries and sectors
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
the data protection directive was was
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
updated by the general data protection
 
00:41:35.329 --> 00:41:35.339 align:start position:0%
regulation or gdpr just a few years ago
 
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
something you may have heard of
 
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.810 align:start position:0%
something you may have heard of
so

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
in our view we need in this country to
 
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
move towards a comprehensive approach to
 
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
privacy and data protection
 
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
it is clear to us that the sort of
 
00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:50.410 align:start position:0%
it is clear to us that the sort of
narrow

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:50.420 align:start position:0%
narrow
 
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
sector-specific approach it no longer
 
00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:54.589 align:start position:0%
sector-specific approach it no longer
works

00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
and the question is how do you
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
transition to that kind of approach
 
00:42:02.329 --> 00:42:02.339 align:start position:0%
given that we have all of these other
 
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
laws on the books
 
00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.109 align:start position:0%
laws on the books
um

00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
is the approach that this bill or that
 
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
other laws have taken to try to Grapple
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
with that problem perfect probably not
 
00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:17.339 align:start position:0%
but we think this is a great first first
 
00:42:17.339 --> 00:42:18.650 align:start position:0%
but we think this is a great first first
step

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
step
 
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:20.339 align:start position:0%
um and a great start in the right
 
00:42:20.339 --> 00:42:21.890 align:start position:0%
um and a great start in the right
direction

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
yes representative griesen thank you Mr
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
Sharon thank you sir for uh providing
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony here is this law required
 
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
in order for Microsoft to be able to
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
implement these very same things as its
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
own internal policy to protect its own
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
personal customers no it's not and
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
you know Mike as Microsoft I can tell
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
you that when the gdpr passed and became
 
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:50.220 align:start position:0%
effective in the European Union we
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
committed publicly that we would apply
 
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
the protections the rights at the heart
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
of the gdpr to consumables consumers
 
00:42:57.599 --> 00:42:58.849 align:start position:0%
of the gdpr to consumables consumers
worldwide

00:42:58.849 --> 00:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
worldwide
 
00:43:01.809 --> 00:43:01.819 align:start position:0%
when California passed its law
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
the CCPA in 2018 we subsequently said we
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
will apply the Protections in that law
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
to Consumers across the entire country
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
but in our view it's not enough to give
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
business and companies the option of
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to protect
 
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
consumers and comply with those sorts of
 
00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.010 align:start position:0%
consumers and comply with those sorts of
safeguards

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
safeguards
 
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
in order to really start earning back
 
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
the trust of the public we need laws
 
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
that just make it clear
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
that everyone will abide by the same
 
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.010 align:start position:0%
that everyone will abide by the same
rules

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
other other question yes uh
 
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr
 
00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.650 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr
chairman

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:45.380 align:start position:0%
um as I understand
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
Microsoft is solidly supportive of the
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
principles in this
 
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
in this uh bill
 
00:43:58.849 --> 00:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
um all out of concern for the consumer
 
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
can you then help me understand
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
in page 16 of my my copy
 
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
um line 31 nothing in this chapter shall
 
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
be construed as providing the basis for
 
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
or be subject to a private right of
 
00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:23.900 align:start position:0%
action for violations under this chapter
 
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
those two lines follow
 
00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:28.690 align:start position:0%
those two lines follow
um

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:28.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
the previous section which lists six
 
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.630 align:start position:0%
the previous section which lists six
possible

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
uh requirements for the Attorney General
 
00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:41.780 align:start position:0%
to consider before it would agree
 
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
to process a complaint
 
00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:47.060 align:start position:0%
and I don't understand
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
why if the purpose is to meet the
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
protection provide the protectors for
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
the consumer why this specifically
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
eliminates consumers right to be able to
 
00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%
file a complaint
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.650 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
I would say if we step back for a moment
 
00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
that there is no issue which has done
 
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
more to derail and prevent
 
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
the passage of privacy laws good privacy
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
laws then the question of enforcement
 
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
and whether a bill should contain a
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
private right of action
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
that issue more than any other killed
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
efforts to pass comprehensive Privacy
 
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
Law in our home state of Washington for
 
00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
four years running
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately that question
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
quickly becomes incredibly polarizing
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
and to different folks across the
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
political Spectrum on that issue it
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
becomes something of a religious issue
 
00:45:52.609 --> 00:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
there are folks in the business
 
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
Community for whom anything that is
 
00:45:59.950 --> 00:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
redolent of a private right of action
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
sends them running for the Hills
 
00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
there are folks on the other side who
 
00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
insist that any Privacy Law or any other
 
00:46:13.609 --> 00:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
law for that matter needs to have a
 
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
extremely broad private right of action
 
00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
with statutory damages and class action
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
liability for technical violations of
 
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
Allah irrespective of whether there is
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
actually any harm at issue in the case
 
00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
and so what we have said and have been
 
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
saying to lawmakers is
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be involved in that
 
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
discussion and that issue we don't think
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
it's productive for us to try to be
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
involved in that discussion
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
we think it's up to policy makers in the
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
state to determine what would be
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate and what would be a strong
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
and effective and appropriate means of
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement we want to see good privacy
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
laws pass
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
um and we think this is a good Privacy
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
Law and we hope that it passes
 
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
other uh representative Anders
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
excuse me taking my question
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
how is a consumer
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
going to trust a company if they ask
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
that their information personal
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
information be deleted
 
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
without going through an attorney
 
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
general which is just going to create
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
Havoc because if thousands of people
 
00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:35.339 align:start position:0%
want the Attorney General wondering if
 
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
their Privacy Information has been
 
00:47:41.809 --> 00:47:41.819 align:start position:0%
deleted or not
 
00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
how can we trust a company and what I'm
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
trying to say is how do we know a
 
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
company's not just hiding that data
 
00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:52.859 align:start position:0%
I think represented that is a very fair
 
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:56.220 align:start position:0%
question and I think the first step in
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
establishing that trust is to impose
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
obligations in law
 
00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
to in fact for example delete someone's
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
data if they ask for it to be deleted
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
that obligation does not exist for New
 
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents today in law
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
there's no obligation for for companies
 
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
when they receive a request from a New
 
00:48:23.569 --> 00:48:23.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident to delete that data
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
um the law does provide that companies
 
00:48:29.809 --> 00:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
need to provide transparency about what
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
they are doing with data that would
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
include in my view responding to
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
deletion requests
 
00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
it would require companies to provide a
 
00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
secure and reliable means of allowing
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
consumers to exercise their rights
 
00:48:50.089 --> 00:48:50.099 align:start position:0%
and it would require companies to
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
document the sort of data processing
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
activities that they are engaging in
 
00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
including responding to deletion
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
requests in Impact assessments which can
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately be made available to the
 
00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:05.339 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and
 
00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
is that is that perfect I don't know is
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
there more that a law could do perhaps
 
00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
is this a good first step I think the
 
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
answer is yes
 
00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.849 align:start position:0%
answer is yes
and

00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing I might say is that look
 
00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert on
 
00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:24.470 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert on
um

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:26.540 align:start position:0%
you know the New Hampshire
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act and and I'm not
 
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's been a long time since I've
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
litigated any cases of any kind
 
00:49:33.119 --> 00:49:34.970 align:start position:0%
litigated any cases of any kind
whatsoever

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
but my view of this bill
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
is that it would not remove any existing
 
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
rights that that New Hampshire consumers
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
may have to file lawsuits today
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
um and so in my view
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
um to the extent New Hampshire residents
 
00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
you know some states provide consumers
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
with the ability to file lawsuits
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
alleging unfair deceptive conduct under
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
their consumer protection acts my view
 
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
is that to the extent that those rights
 
00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
exist for New Hampshire residents today
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
and I don't know whether they do or not
 
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
they or or they don't
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
this bill would not take those rights
 
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.010 align:start position:0%
this bill would not take those rights
away

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
it also would not take away existing
 
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
rights that consumers may have to bring
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
lawsuits under the sort of common law
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
privacy torts that have long existed in
 
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
this country
 
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
my questions
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
this is a law to me that what it really
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
does it has no consequences it's totally
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the attorney general
 
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
and what consequences he feels would be
 
00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:54.730 align:start position:0%
and what consequences he feels would be
appropriate

00:50:54.730 --> 00:50:54.740 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing that concerns me
 
00:50:59.569 --> 00:50:59.579 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's like
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
if you speed there's a financial
 
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
consequence okay if there isn't I'll go
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
as fast as I want to go
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
I don't see in this
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
the end when it says enforcement
 
00:51:17.569 --> 00:51:17.579 align:start position:0%
is this bill enforceable and in other
 
00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:20.540 align:start position:0%
states are they providing more
 
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
consequences or enforcement of the bill
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
is that something we should look at to
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
see if perhaps one of the things that's
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
hard to do after you pass a bill is to
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
put the enforcement in afterwards
 
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
it's easier to take it out than it is to
 
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
put it in so our other state saying if a
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
company does this and they are found to
 
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
do this then this will happen to them
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
because we're not saying that here thank
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the question
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
representative I would say at the outset
 
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
that we absolutely support strong
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement and think that enforcement
 
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
has to be a component of a strong data
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
protection and privacy regime in order
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
to hold companies accountable if they
 
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
violate the law
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
um most other states have provided that
 
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement will be done by the state
 
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:23.579 align:start position:0%
and and oftentimes it is either
 
00:52:25.849 --> 00:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
um or or pursuant to the attorney
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
general's authority to enforce say their
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
State's udep or consumer protection act
 
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
which is the approach taken by this bill
 
00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:38.839 align:start position:0%
um California
 
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
has gone a step further
 
00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
and has created an entire new agency the
 
00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:48.980 align:start position:0%
California privacy Protection Agency
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
designed to some extent on similar data
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
protection authorities that exist in
 
00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
each country in the European Union which
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
are responsible there for
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
enforcing just the the gdpr or that
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
country's Privacy Law so that is the
 
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
approach that California has taken and
 
00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
you know they have provided that agency
 
00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
with rule making Authority and resources
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
in in lots of things to help it enforce
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
the law and even issue regulations
 
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.530 align:start position:0%
the law and even issue regulations
um

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:28.329 --> 00:53:28.339 align:start position:0%
that's not an issue that I would pretend
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know I would not pretend to know
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
what will work for a particular State
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
um I think it makes sense to provide in
 
00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
in there is a need absolutely to provide
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh regulators
 
00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:46.740 align:start position:0%
who are going to be responsible for
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
enforcing a law with resources they will
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
need to enforce the law but but I
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pretend to tell policy makers
 
00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
what those resources should be given all
 
00:53:59.089 --> 00:53:59.099 align:start position:0%
of the other priorities that that you
 
00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
all deal with on a daily basis
 
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:02.809 align:start position:0%
all deal with on a daily basis
yes

00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
so the other states that were mentioned
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
I believe it was Connecticut and several
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
States so to your knowledge none of them
 
00:54:12.359 --> 00:54:13.970 align:start position:0%
States so to your knowledge none of them
have

00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
fines or written penalties or
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
Consequences to not following their laws
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
there may be fines I would have to
 
00:54:27.049 --> 00:54:27.059 align:start position:0%
follow go back and double check those
 
00:54:28.609 --> 00:54:28.619 align:start position:0%
laws and if you would like I'd be happy
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
to do that and provide more information
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
um I know that
 
00:54:38.109 --> 00:54:38.119 align:start position:0%
um and so they may expressly spell out
 
00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
you know the penalty is going to be X
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
number of dollars per violation I know
 
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
that based on the discussions that I was
 
00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
a part of in Washington state you know
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
again a bill that didn't pass but that
 
00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:53.099 align:start position:0%
there were different versions of that
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
bill that either expressly listed the
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
fines in the Privacy bill or simply
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
um the fines that currently exist under
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
Washington State consumer protection act
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
but if it would be helpful I'd be happy
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
to follow up with it shouldn't be hard
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
to to pull I'd be happy to follow up
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
with that information yes representative
 
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.309 align:start position:0%
 
child

00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:55:21.049 --> 00:55:21.059 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you for taking my
 
00:55:21.059 --> 00:55:22.190 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you for taking my
question

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:25.730 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's not possible
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
to have a website be different to comply
 
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
with each State's individual law as more
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
and more States passed consumer
 
00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:38.579 align:start position:0%
protection laws
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering about isn't the
 
00:55:44.089 --> 00:55:44.099 align:start position:0%
standard going to de facto become the
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
state that has the most stringent or
 
00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
most consumer protective
 
00:55:49.859 --> 00:55:51.670 align:start position:0%
most consumer protective
statute

00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:55:54.049 --> 00:55:54.059 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering about that and I'm
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
wondering also whether just by its sheer
 
00:55:57.119 --> 00:55:58.970 align:start position:0%
wondering also whether just by its sheer
size

00:55:58.970 --> 00:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
size
 
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
California will become or is or will
 
00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
become the de facto standard and then
 
00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
also I'm just wondering I mean I'm sure
 
00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
we all use
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
california-based websites Apple
 
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.530 align:start position:0%
california-based websites Apple
obviously

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
um and I I wouldn't have known that
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
there's an opt-out consistent with
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
California law
 
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:25.430 align:start position:0%
California law
um

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering about that just
 
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
about your experience about that also
 
00:56:32.569 --> 00:56:32.579 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you representative
 
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
I mean you would think and would hope
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
that perhaps all companies would simply
 
00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
align to whatever the strongest privacy
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
State Privacy Law is and just apply that
 
00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
but there is a lot of money in data
 
00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
and I think the reality is that gives
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
incentives to companies to differentiate
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
and to not provide protections to
 
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
individuals if they aren't legally
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
obligated to do so and there are
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
techniques that companies can use
 
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
whether it's through IP addresses or
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise to try and identify
 
00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
where residents are located and
 
00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
therefore to apply different protections
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
to them
 
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.490 align:start position:0%
to them
so

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
I think it's also
 
00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
fair to point out that
 
00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
this this law which is or this bill
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
which is based substantially on the law
 
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
that passed in Connecticut
 
00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
and is based upon a framework that was
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
originally developed by a man named
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
reuven Carlisle who was a senator in
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
Washington State
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
that framework was initially an effort
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
to take what California did in 2018.
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
and to go further
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
but to do so using Concepts and
 
00:57:59.930 --> 00:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
terminology that ultimately come from
 
00:58:02.329 --> 00:58:02.339 align:start position:0%
the European Union's general data
 
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
protection regulation
 
00:58:07.609 --> 00:58:07.619 align:start position:0%
and therefore to both provide consumers
 
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
with more protections and more rights
 
00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
than California law was providing
 
00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
but to do so in a way that is clear and
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
more concise and using terms that
 
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
businesses who were already doing
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
business outside of the country were
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
already familiar with and therefore
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
in our view not only more protective to
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
Consumers but also easier for companies
 
00:58:33.049 --> 00:58:33.059 align:start position:0%
to comply with
 
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
now the reality is that subsequent to
 
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
California passing their law the CCPA
 
00:58:42.049 --> 00:58:42.059 align:start position:0%
California voters updated their law with
 
00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
a ballot initiative the California
 
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
privacy rights act that ballot
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
initiative in my view
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
brought California law substantively to
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
um but the Frameworks while they arrive
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
at a very similar substantive place the
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are different and there are
 
00:59:07.329 --> 00:59:07.339 align:start position:0%
some significant ways that in my view
 
00:59:10.609 --> 00:59:10.619 align:start position:0%
this bill is is more privacy protective
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
California law for example gives people
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
with the right to opt out of data sales
 
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
and the sharing of information for
 
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
purposes of targeted advertising
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
this law would provide people with the
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
right to opt out not only of data sales
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
but of the processing meaning any
 
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
collection use sharing Etc of data for
 
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
targeted advertising so in my view the
 
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
op.right is broader
 
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:39.900 align:start position:0%
this bill would provide people with the
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
right to provide opt-in consent and
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
would specifically specifically provides
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
that companies cannot use dark patterns
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
or in other words efforts to deceive
 
00:59:52.609 --> 00:59:52.619 align:start position:0%
people by the way you design your
 
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
website or your consent experience in
 
00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:56.700 align:start position:0%
order to get you to consent
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
but with the right to opt in to the use
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
of your sensitive data so data like
 
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
Biometrics geolocation information race
 
01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:05.420 align:start position:0%
ethnicity religious beliefs Etc
 
01:00:08.089 --> 01:00:08.099 align:start position:0%
California law provides people with the
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
right to notice and opt out of that data
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
collection so
 
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
in any event again I I think that this
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
law this bill in California law arrive
 
01:00:21.049 --> 01:00:21.059 align:start position:0%
at similar places there there are a
 
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
number of ways in which I think it is a
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
superior approach representative page
 
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
did you have a question representative
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative Horrigan if you have a
 
01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:29.329 align:start position:0%
uh representative Horrigan if you have a
question

01:00:29.329 --> 01:00:29.339 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
um thank you if we the committee choose
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
to go forward with it um I understand
 
01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.569 align:start position:0%
to go forward with it um I understand
why

01:00:35.569 --> 01:00:35.579 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
the California laws in your view the
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
strongest at least the first law is
 
01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
passed and the strongest and of course
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's a senator of high tech but on the
 
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
other hand we had a debate recently
 
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
about electric vehicles and actually the
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
argument against was basically
 
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
this this is a California this is a
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
California California standard this is a
 
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
California law so how has that been a
 
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
problem in in the other states like your
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
own home state of Washington state and
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
um just so how do we how would we sell
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
it to the full house if we go forward to
 
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
this if it's since we may lose some
 
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
votes simply by the magic word
 
01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:14.630 align:start position:0%
votes simply by the magic word
California

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
California
 
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
well this is I guess from that
 
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
perspective fortunately this is not
 
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
California and I'm not sure I would say
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
California law is the strongest in the
 
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
country I think that there are some
 
01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:27.059 align:start position:0%
people who would argue that I think that
 
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:28.140 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of others who would
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
argue that Colorado and Connecticut
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
which their laws are very similar that
 
01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:35.099 align:start position:0%
they are the strongest privacy laws in
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
in the country so look I I think if
 
01:01:41.569 --> 01:01:41.579 align:start position:0%
you're trying to sell this bill to your
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the house
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
the pitch is that this bill would both
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
provide consumers with the rights that
 
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
are necessary to control their personal
 
01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:53.450 align:start position:0%
are necessary to control their personal
data

01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
while also providing businesses with
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
clear rules of the road so that they can
 
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
continue to innovate with certainty and
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
and with confidence and to do so frankly
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
in a way
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is interoperable with other laws
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
that have passed not only in the United
 
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
States but also I think to some extent
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
with international data protection laws
 
01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
like the European Union's general data
 
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
protection regulation all right
 
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:24.109 align:start position:0%
protection regulation all right
representative

01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:25.619 align:start position:0%
hi there thank you for taking my
 
01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
question isn't it true that New
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a consumer protection act
 
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
that would allow for the AG to enforce a
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
penalty if this were to be violated
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
yes my understanding is yes thank you
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh are
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
there any states that have laws that
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
just have a outright ban of the
 
01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
collection of personal digital personal
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
Digital Data
 
01:03:00.839 --> 01:03:02.930 align:start position:0%
Digital Data
no

01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
I in our view like that would not be a
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
good thing because
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
um personal data can and is can be and
 
01:03:17.809 --> 01:03:17.819 align:start position:0%
is used for a lot of really beneficial
 
01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
purposes to provide the public with
 
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
products and services that it wants
 
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
um to conduct research and and other
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
things and I also think that if you'd
 
01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:33.500 align:start position:0%
passed a law that
 
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
simply prohibited the collection of
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
personal data
 
01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.289 align:start position:0%
personal data
um

01:03:39.289 --> 01:03:39.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
you would also run into real challenges
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
with the first amendment's protection
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
for freedom of expression
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
thank you yes uh representative
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
for taking our questions uh on page
 
01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:55.849 align:start position:0%
for taking our questions uh on page
seven

01:03:55.849 --> 01:03:55.859 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:03:59.569 --> 01:03:59.579 align:start position:0%
lines 19 beginning in line 19 of this
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
bill this is information provided in
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
response to a consumer request shall be
 
01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
provided by a controller free of charge
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
once per customer a consumer excuse me
 
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
during any 12-month period does this
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
mean that a consumer would have to
 
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
submit annual requests to have their
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
information removed or deleted uh and
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
and is the controller obligated to
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
eliminate this data for a one-year
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
period of time I I guess my question is
 
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
is is is if if they can be charged a fee
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
or they can be denied due to excessive
 
01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
or repetitive requests how long is a is
 
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
is a company uh required to
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
to conceal this data or delete this data
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
so in thank you representative and so
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
this was I'm sorry I was trying to find
 
01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
the provision this is Page seven line
 
01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
19. yeah
 
01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.549 align:start position:0%
19. yeah
um

01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
so I think a couple of things I think
 
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.530 align:start position:0%
so I think a couple of things I think
one

01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:04.370 align:start position:0%
one
um

01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:07.849 --> 01:05:07.859 align:start position:0%
this bill importantly says that
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
consumers have the ability to exercise
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
these rights and to do so free of charge
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
um could you simply provide that they
 
01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
have the right to do so free of charge
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
and eliminate the requirement that that
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
right only applied once during any
 
01:05:28.609 --> 01:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
12-month period you could sure
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
um but I think you know what is
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
important is that
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
the bill would also to the extent that a
 
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
company determines that that someone is
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
harassing them
 
01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
and is submitting multiple requests
 
01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:46.619 align:start position:0%
um you know for for
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
to to harass or for whatever reason that
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
the company then Bears the burden of
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that those requests are in
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
fact manifestly unfounded excessive or
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
repetitive in nature I think that
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know this provision arrived at the
 
01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
place that it is in Connecticut
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
um be out of a desire to try and balance
 
01:06:09.359 --> 01:06:11.390 align:start position:0%
um be out of a desire to try and balance
both

01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
providing consumers with the ability to
 
01:06:18.289 --> 01:06:18.299 align:start position:0%
exercise their rights easily
 
01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
and in Freely
 
01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
while also ensuring that companies are
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
not subject to
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
undue requests or excessive burdens and
 
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
trying to comply and respond to requests
 
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
and I think that that is less of an
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
issue for a big company like Microsoft
 
01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
which has lots of resources at its
 
01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:42.839 align:start position:0%
disposal and more of an issue for
 
01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
smaller companies which would still be
 
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
subject to the the provisions of the law
 
01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:50.510 align:start position:0%
subject to the the provisions of the law
representative

01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
a question yes thank you Mr chair
 
01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
um two if I if I could is Microsoft
 
01:06:58.010 --> 01:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
already operating more or less in line
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
with the provisions in this chapter
 
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
yes okay so would Microsoft be okay if
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
we removed
 
01:07:08.329 --> 01:07:08.339 align:start position:0%
um section four of the enforcement that
 
01:07:08.339 --> 01:07:09.170 align:start position:0%
um section four of the enforcement that
would

01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
nothing in this chapter shall be
 
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
construed as providing basis for subject
 
01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
to a private right of action
 
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
I would say that we are we support the
 
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
bill as written and and we are not
 
01:07:23.329 --> 01:07:23.339 align:start position:0%
taking a position
 
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
um on enforcement we support the bill as
 
01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:26.150 align:start position:0%
um on enforcement we support the bill as
written

01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
all right other questions for this
 
01:07:27.359 --> 01:07:28.730 align:start position:0%
all right other questions for this
Witness

01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stapleton
 
01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:33.059 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
the um question brought up by
 
01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
representative Grecian was interesting
 
01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:38.990 align:start position:0%
representative Grecian was interesting
because

01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
the one-year uh
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
pre-exempt uh for a request seems to
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
parallel what is already taking place in
 
01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:50.700 align:start position:0%
the credit industry and credit reports
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how many years that is
 
01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:55.140 align:start position:0%
but uh there probably is some federal
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
law behind that which impelled that so
 
01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of this seems to be
 
01:08:01.079 --> 01:08:01.730 align:start position:0%
a lot of this seems to be
um

01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
there's underlying statute and law
 
01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
already in place on a lot of this stuff
 
01:08:09.490 --> 01:08:09.500 align:start position:0%
is there not
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
there there are
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
um yes there there are laws and
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
Provisions on some of these things that
 
01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
address some of these issues in a way
 
01:08:23.329 --> 01:08:23.339 align:start position:0%
that is consistent with the way this
 
01:08:25.849 --> 01:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
bill would address them
 
01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:26.450 align:start position:0%
bill would address them
um

01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
I do think that this bill would go much
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
further than existing law in in clearly
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
providing consumers with rights among
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
other things
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
um but the concepts that are in this
 
01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:41.990 align:start position:0%
um but the concepts that are in this
bill

01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
um aren't new
 
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
and and do exist in say other
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
comprehensive privacy laws that have
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
passed across the country
 
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
um in other laws around the world like
 
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
the general data protection regulation
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
other representative Terror
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks and thanks for taking this
 
01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.709 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks and thanks for taking this
question

01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
um I guess my my question and let me
 
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
Focus specifically on page 10
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
um lines starting on line 34
 
01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
um section 2 B I guess
 
01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.709 align:start position:0%
um section 2 B I guess
um

01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
I guess there's there there's an adage
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
that if if you're not paying for the uh
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
paying for the product then you are the
 
01:09:27.650 --> 01:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
product which seems to be part of this
 
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
discussion but not really sort of clear
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
um if someone exercises this right to
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
remove their data am I reading in this
 
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
section and I don't know if this is true
 
01:09:41.329 --> 01:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
currently or not but that it would be
 
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
possible then to
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh begin charging consumers essentially
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
for the service that their data would
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise be
 
01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:51.950 align:start position:0%
otherwise be
um

01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
used to provide for free I know that's
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
the business model of a lot of online
 
01:09:58.729 --> 01:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
entities these days
 
01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
um and I couldn't tell if this section
 
01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
was meant to either open the door for
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
that or clarify but it seems to suggest
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
that if you opt out you could then be
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
you could set up a system where you
 
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
would then be charged for the services
 
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
so the the the Bill thank you for the
 
01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:17.090 align:start position:0%
so the the the Bill thank you for the
question

01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
um it's a good question the the bill
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
does provide that businesses cannot I
 
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
believe I was trying to find the
 
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
specific provision but but cannot
 
01:10:30.649 --> 01:10:30.659 align:start position:0%
discriminate against consumers for
 
01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
exercising their rights
 
01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
um it does also attempt to balance that
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
with efforts to provide people with say
 
01:10:44.649 --> 01:10:44.659 align:start position:0%
loyalty programs or
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
other forms of programs in which data
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
really is a part of the transaction and
 
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
in programs which provide direct benefit
 
01:10:57.649 --> 01:10:57.659 align:start position:0%
and value to the consumers so think that
 
01:10:59.689 --> 01:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
loyalty program that you may have at
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
your grocery store
 
01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
um and in
 
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
provides or attempts to allow those
 
01:11:10.729 --> 01:11:10.739 align:start position:0%
kinds of programs to continue to to move
 
01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
um or or to operate so I think the bill
 
01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
does a good job of trying to
 
01:11:21.649 --> 01:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
balance those two things
 
01:11:21.659 --> 01:11:22.430 align:start position:0%
balance those two things
um

01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
again I would say in general
 
01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:26.950 align:start position:0%
again I would say in general
um

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
is it perfect does it does it get it
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely right I don't know
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
um but but I think it lands in a very
 
01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
reasonable place can I just have one
 
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
follow-up on that yes so did I
 
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
understand you to say that that this uh
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
prohibition against discrimination would
 
01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
essentially in your in your
 
01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:49.189 align:start position:0%
essentially in your in your
understanding

01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
prevent companies from just basically
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
saying well if we can't if you're not
 
01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
sharing your data with us then you have
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
to pay for our product as opposed to the
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
loyalty programs and the other sort of
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
sort of that is that's my reading okay
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes other questions for this Witness
 
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
so I I guess I just have one question on
 
01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
the on the application section
 
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
um where it says
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
um that it's limited to 100 and I'm just
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
quoting here controlled uh
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
or process the personal data of not less
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
than 100 000 consumers I guess what I'm
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
wondering is
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's there's no time frame there is
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
that right so in other words if I'm a
 
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
small business and I process
 
01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
10 000 consumers this year and 10 000
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
different consumers next year and you
 
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
know in other words do I get cat 20
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
years from now do I get or 10 years from
 
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
now do I get captured by this
 
01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:52.850 align:start position:0%
now do I get captured by this
um

01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
where I you know even though I'm a small
 
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
business and and I guess what I'm
 
01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
wondering is should it say 100 000 per
 
01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
year for example
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
that is I believe that is what most
 
01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
other bills have or laws have provided
 
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
that this is on an annual basis
 
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
um I agree Mr chair as I'm looking at
 
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
the provision I don't see those words on
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
the page
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
if they're not in the bill somewhere
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
else I mean that seems like a reasonable
 
01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.850 align:start position:0%
else I mean that seems like a reasonable
addition

01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
addition
 
01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:26.510 align:start position:0%
addition
um

01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
you know the the the thresholds on the
 
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
companies that this would apply to in
 
01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
terms of size Etc is not something that
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
we have gotten super involved with just
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
because it may surprise you to find but
 
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
Microsoft isn't a small business
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
um and but but I do think in principle
 
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to provide sort of
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
exemptions so that you're not
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
overburdening your local dry cleaner or
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
coffee shop and and those sorts of
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
things can I just ask where a follow-up
 
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
is is the the the limits that are in
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
this bill of a hundred thousand and and
 
01:14:05.209 --> 01:14:05.219 align:start position:0%
then the second one of 25
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
000 uh and not derived more than 25
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
percent uh from sale are those the same
 
01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
as our our in the Connecticut Bill and
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
and the Virginia Bill uh and the color
 
01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
uh I think it was Colorado or or the or
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
are the numbers different in those
 
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
States I would Mr chair I would have to
 
01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:27.020 align:start position:0%
follow back up with those
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
laws to confirm whether they are in fact
 
01:14:30.239 --> 01:14:31.970 align:start position:0%
laws to confirm whether they are in fact
identical

01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
identical
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
um I believe they're similar
 
01:14:36.729 --> 01:14:36.739 align:start position:0%
um you know and and
 
01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
are those numbers right for a state like
 
01:14:42.410 --> 01:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I I don't know
 
01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
um you know and I'm not sure we would
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
have a position on what the numbers
 
01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
should be exactly as long as they
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
weren't so high that you know we are
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
some of our peers would would not be
 
01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
covered by the law right you know I
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
think it would be helpful to us if you
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
could if you could if somebody could
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
just get us what the numbers are in the
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
other states that should that would be
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
helpful other questions for this Witness
 
01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you
 
01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
you know I saw Senator Susie come in but
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
then she left it she
 
01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
she had to leave again I'm sorry so um
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh I note that we are now uh 15 minutes
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
over the time we were supposed to have
 
01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
started the hearing on the next bill
 
01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
um I but this is important and so we're
 
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
gonna we're gonna keep going the only
 
01:15:28.729 --> 01:15:28.739 align:start position:0%
thing I would ask is as future Witnesses
 
01:15:31.370 --> 01:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
come up if if you've heard somebody has
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
already covered a point um we really
 
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
don't need to hear it like two or three
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
times so I just ask if you keep your if
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
you could keep your remarks as brief as
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
possible and I'm next going to call on
 
01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
Brandon uh garage I hope I'm pronouncing
 
01:15:58.130 --> 01:15:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairperson members of the
 
01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Brandon garad I am
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
the chief of the consumer protection and
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
antitrust Bureau at the Attorney
 
01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
General's office and the attorney
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
general I'm here today to speak on
 
01:16:12.169 --> 01:16:12.179 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Attorney General neither
 
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
in support of or against this bill but
 
01:16:17.090 --> 01:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
in order to point out some concerns that
 
01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
were brought to the attention of the
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
Senate that still exist in its current
 
01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
form at its core you know this is a bill
 
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
where we certainly take no issue with
 
01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
the intent behind it it is a
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
pro-consumer bill it is comprehensive it
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
contains definitions that it is
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
technically for the most part
 
01:16:35.159 --> 01:16:36.490 align:start position:0%
technically for the most part
enforceable

01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:36.500 align:start position:0%
enforceable
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
subject to some issues that I'll get to
 
01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
in a minute but for those of you
 
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
normally when bills you know come that
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
impact New Hampshire's consumer
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
protection act they appear in Commerce
 
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
um and so I always appear at you know
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
house Commerce Senate Commerce at the
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year to give an
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
overview of New Hampshire's consumer
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
protection act and what the bureau does
 
01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is because every
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
time something is added to New
 
01:16:58.610 --> 01:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's consumer protection act
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
something new is defined as an unfair
 
01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:02.420 align:start position:0%
interceptive act or practice
 
01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
a real consideration that needs to be
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
thought through is the issue of
 
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
resources and who is going to if you you
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
could pass all the laws you want and
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
they can be perfect and comprehensive
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
and well-defined but if you don't have
 
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
the Manpower and the resources to
 
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
enforce that bill depending on the
 
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
amount of the number of complaints and
 
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
the you know amount of work that it's
 
01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
going to take at the end of the day can
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
be essentially toothless so New
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Consumer Protection Bureau
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
has exclusive authority to enforce New
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's consumer protection act with
 
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
the exception of there's a private right
 
01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
of action that applies not in this bill
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
which I'll get to in a moment but which
 
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
applies to essentially all other things
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
that are defined under the consumer
 
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
protection act as unfair and deceptive
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
Acts or practices but as far as state
 
01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
enforcement anything that is defined as
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
an unfair and deceptive act or practice
 
01:17:59.649 --> 01:17:59.659 align:start position:0%
falls on the Consumer Protection Bureau
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
to review those types of complaints
 
01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
investigate those complaints and if
 
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
appropriate prosecute those complaints
 
01:18:07.729 --> 01:18:07.739 align:start position:0%
through either civil or criminal
 
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement action
 
01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
that as it currently stands results in a
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of work that is
 
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
accomplished by not a tremendous number
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
of people the bureau just in its unfair
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
and deceptive Acts or practices work
 
01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
receives about
 
01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
4500 complaints and inquiries a year we
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
have a consumer protection hotline that
 
01:18:33.169 --> 01:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
is manned entirely by volunteers they
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
serve as an initial Shepherd of those
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
calls to basically try to if it's you
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
know an inquiry that's not going to be
 
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
an unfair and deceptive act or practice
 
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
we tried to send them elsewhere or to
 
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
another appropriate state agency but if
 
01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
it is something that you know arguably
 
01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
could be an unfair and deceptive act or
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
practices I personally along with the
 
01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
paralegals in the bureau review every
 
01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
single one of those complaints and make
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
efforts to resolve every single one of
 
01:18:59.810 --> 01:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
those complaints we are successful
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes oftentimes we are not and if
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
we are not able to Simply resolve it
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
with the back and forth of the business
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
it falls to the bureau through only two
 
01:19:12.649 --> 01:19:12.659 align:start position:0%
invest Gators and about nine lawyers to
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
issue subpoenas to take depositions to
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
conduct interviews with witnesses to try
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
to build cases in order to actually go
 
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
to court and enforce these laws to hold
 
01:19:23.689 --> 01:19:23.699 align:start position:0%
these businesses accountable and it
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
currently takes a tremendous amount of
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
work and that unfair and deceptive Acts
 
01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
or practices work is only a small
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
segment of what the bureau is actually
 
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
responsible for it's the consumer
 
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
protection antitrust Bureau so we're
 
01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
also responsible for all of the state's
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
antitrust enforcement work I'm sure it's
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
no secret to any members of this
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
committee that in recent years New
 
01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Health Care system has faced
 
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
an enormous amount of attempted and
 
01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:51.140 align:start position:0%
successful in some cases consolidation
 
01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts hospitals coming into New
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to to buy our Hospital Systems
 
01:19:57.649 --> 01:19:57.659 align:start position:0%
make us part of their systems every
 
01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
single one of those Hospital
 
01:20:01.729 --> 01:20:01.739 align:start position:0%
transactions and other transactions is
 
01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
extremely comprehensively reviewed for
 
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
violations of State antitrust laws by
 
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
oftentimes you know just one or two two
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
members of our Bureau that are committed
 
01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
to doing that work full-time
 
01:20:16.570 --> 01:20:16.580 align:start position:0%
the bureau is also responsible for
 
01:20:19.610 --> 01:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
reviewing annually compliance with
 
01:20:21.410 --> 01:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
consumer protection laws for every
 
01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
health club in the state of New
 
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire every martial arts studio in
 
01:20:27.169 --> 01:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire the bureau is
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
also responsible for reviewing and
 
01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
approving compliance with State consumer
 
01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
protection laws for every single new
 
01:20:35.689 --> 01:20:35.699 align:start position:0%
condominium that is sold in the state
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
every subdivision that is offered for
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
sale to the public in the state we're
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
also responsible for representing the
 
01:20:45.169 --> 01:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
state's second injury fund we are
 
01:20:46.850 --> 01:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
responsible for New Hampshire's tobacco
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement work which results in a
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money to the state
 
01:20:52.729 --> 01:20:52.739 align:start position:0%
each year and you know also are
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for have a very robust elder
 
01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
abuse and financial exploitation unit
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
that criminally investigates and
 
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
prosecutes some of the most serious
 
01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
cases of elder abuse and financial
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
exploitation in the state
 
01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
and we're able to accomplish that with
 
01:21:08.689 --> 01:21:08.699 align:start position:0%
the resources we have but even with the
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
resources we have we're limited to only
 
01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
taking those cases that are the most
 
01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.149 align:start position:0%
taking those cases that are the most
serious

01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
serious
 
01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
um and the rest we defer if it's
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
criminal to the you know County
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys or local prosecutors to do
 
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
that work or you know if it is a civil
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
matter we often tell consumers you know
 
01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
you have a private right of action so if
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a smaller violation a single
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
violation consumers have that ability
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
um to share the the burden of consumer
 
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
protection enforcement with this bill
 
01:21:36.649 --> 01:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
and the reason I point all this out is
 
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
that this bill has the potential to
 
01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:40.739 align:start position:0%
create an enormous amount of additional
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
work for the bureau which I think
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
realistically to do would require
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
additional resources in the bureau both
 
01:21:49.149 --> 01:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
in the form of attorney
 
01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
investigator and potentially a paralegal
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
as well and I know that since my
 
01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
testimony in this regard before the
 
01:21:58.910 --> 01:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
Senate there have been conversations
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
about potentially adding some of those
 
01:22:02.570 --> 01:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
resources to the bureau but I think it's
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
critical that as members of this
 
01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
committee decide whether to make this
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
part of New Hampshire's consumer
 
01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
protection act and place this
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility on the Consumer
 
01:22:12.530 --> 01:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau of the AG's office
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
that you understand that in order to
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
meaningfully do it and be able to
 
01:22:19.970 --> 01:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
accomplish the type of protections and
 
01:22:21.649 --> 01:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
enforcement of these protections that
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
you're attempting to create for New
 
01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consumers it would take
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
additional resources in order to
 
01:22:29.050 --> 01:22:29.060 align:start position:0%
meaningfully accomplish that
 
01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
especially because
 
01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
um as was pointed out earlier this bill
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
the drafters have made the decision to
 
01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
eliminate the private right of action
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
that is present in all other unfair and
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
deceptive Acts or practices cases that
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
can currently be brought in the state
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
so like I referenced earlier if so if
 
01:22:51.229 --> 01:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
you have a single complaint you know one
 
01:22:53.209 --> 01:22:53.219 align:start position:0%
consumer complains and says hey this
 
01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
company is
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
um violating is get engaged in unfair
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
and deceptive Acts or practices maybe
 
01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
it's a contractor used car dealer
 
01:23:03.649 --> 01:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
something like that if it's a one-off
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
complaint it's not a lot of money
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately based on limitations on
 
01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
resources we're often in the position of
 
01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
telling the consumer this is something
 
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
that you'll have to pursue on your own
 
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
by bringing your own private unfair and
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
deceptive Acts or practices case we
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
can't do that in this case because the
 
01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
private right of action has been taken
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
away so every single violation of this
 
01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
bill if it becomes law that's reported
 
01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
to the Attorney General's office will
 
01:23:31.850 --> 01:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
either be prosecuted by the Attorney
 
01:23:33.890 --> 01:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
General's office or won't be prosecuted
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
at all there is no ability for us to
 
01:23:39.169 --> 01:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
share that burden with others and you
 
01:23:40.729 --> 01:23:40.739 align:start position:0%
know obviously there there may be
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
reasons for that decision but I think
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
the the reality of the potential for the
 
01:23:47.570 --> 01:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
increase workload would demand
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
additional resources in order to be able
 
01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
to do it effectively and you know there
 
01:23:55.729 --> 01:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
was a comment that was made by a
 
01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative earlier that you know it
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
would be unlikely that the Attorney
 
01:24:03.050 --> 01:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
General would choose to pursue a single
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
violation of the statute if it was
 
01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
reported and I just want to point out
 
01:24:10.490 --> 01:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
that that is not necessarily true and
 
01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
especially if the violation if if we
 
01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
have a reported violation of law that we
 
01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:20.219 align:start position:0%
enforce and only we enforce and if we
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to say you know
 
01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
here are some other resources or here is
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
you know your ability to seek Justice on
 
01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
your own it places Us in the position of
 
01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
either ignoring a violation of law
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
altogether or investigating it so you
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
know we really cannot look the other way
 
01:24:39.229 --> 01:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
if a company is violating New Hampshire
 
01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
law especially if the consumer who's
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
affected in that regard has no other
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
recourse anywhere else based on that
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
value Nation
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
so I do think you know will we prosecute
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
every single violation probably not but
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
if a single consumer
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
if this bill is passed if a single
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
consumer files a complaint with the
 
01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
bureau and says hey I've made a request
 
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
that my data be deleted from this
 
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
company we would have an obligation
 
01:25:08.209 --> 01:25:08.219 align:start position:0%
based on our responsibilities as New
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Consumer Protection Bureau
 
01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
to at a minimum review that complaint
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
look into that complaint bring that
 
01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
complaint to the attention of the
 
01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
business and if they ignored it they
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
ignored inquiries from us we'd be left
 
01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
in a very difficult position of deciding
 
01:25:24.290 --> 01:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
you know either we're going to ignore
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
this altogether or we're going to bring
 
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit in order to make sure that
 
01:25:30.169 --> 01:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
they comply with New Hampshire law that
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility is one that we take very
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
seriously and one that requires a
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
significant amount of manpower to
 
01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.669 align:start position:0%
significant amount of manpower to
accomplish

01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
01:25:37.679 --> 01:25:39.290 align:start position:0%
accomplish
so

01:25:39.290 --> 01:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
I think that for the most part is my
 
01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
testimony as it pertains to resources I
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
do also want to point out one
 
01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
inconsistency ambiguity in the
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement section of the statute that
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
I brought to the attention of the Senate
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
that in my opinion still exists and I
 
01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
think it's a really important one
 
01:25:58.729 --> 01:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
located on page 16.
 
01:26:04.729 --> 01:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at line 19 through 24. it's
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
basically two sections that govern the
 
01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:10.139 align:start position:0%
requirement of the Attorney General to
 
01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
provide 60 days notice in an attempt to
 
01:26:14.689 --> 01:26:14.699 align:start position:0%
cure before bringing any action for a
 
01:26:17.570 --> 01:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
violation in this matter so if you begin
 
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
on line 19 Roman 2 I'm just going to
 
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
quote this the attorney general shall
 
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
prior to initiating any action for a
 
01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:26.219 align:start position:0%
violation under this chapter issue a
 
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
notice a violation to the controller if
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General determines that a
 
01:26:33.649 --> 01:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
cure is possible and if the controller
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
fails to cure such violation within 60
 
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
days of receipt of the notice of
 
01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
violation attorney general may bring an
 
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
action pursuant to this section so as
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
that section as I read that section it
 
01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
gives the
 
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
whether or not the attorney general has
 
01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
to issue a 60-day notice and opportunity
 
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
to cure is entirely determined by
 
01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
whether the AG in our opinion believes
 
01:27:01.129 --> 01:27:01.139 align:start position:0%
that a cure is possible
 
01:27:03.169 --> 01:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
but then in the following section Roman
 
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
3 beginning on line 23 it says in
 
01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
determining whether to Grant a
 
01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
controller or processor the opportunity
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
to cure an alleged violation described
 
01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
under this chapter there's a number of
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
factors that the Attorney General's
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
office may consider and they really
 
01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
don't relate to the ability to cure in
 
01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
fact many of them deal with potential
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
harm to the public the complexity of the
 
01:27:29.209 --> 01:27:29.219 align:start position:0%
size and complexity of the processor the
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
number of violations nature and extent
 
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
of controller or processors processing
 
01:27:35.209 --> 01:27:35.219 align:start position:0%
activities substantial likelihood of
 
01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
injury to the public safety of persons
 
01:27:39.649 --> 01:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
or property this seems to give us
 
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
factors that we can consider in
 
01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not we need to
 
01:27:47.209 --> 01:27:47.219 align:start position:0%
bring or we need to give them an
 
01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
opportunity to cure where is the prior
 
01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
section says that the only factor that
 
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
we can consider is whether the Cure is
 
01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
possible I see those things as extremely
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
inconsistent and would basically put us
 
01:27:59.870 --> 01:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
in a position of feeling that we needed
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
to issue a notice of attempt to here
 
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
every single time because I I don't know
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's hard and I'm not an expert in this
 
01:28:10.129 --> 01:28:10.139 align:start position:0%
by any means but it's hard to imagine a
 
01:28:12.649 --> 01:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
violation that wouldn't be in any way
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
shape or form curable
 
01:28:17.629 --> 01:28:17.639 align:start position:0%
um so so let me just ask you a question
 
01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
sure if we were to change section two uh
 
01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
to from Shell to May and if we were to
 
01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
end that first sentence so that it read
 
01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:27.719 align:start position:0%
so that it read the Attorney General May
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
prior to initiating an action for
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
violation under this chapter issue a
 
01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
notice of violation to the controller
 
01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:36.350 align:start position:0%
notice of violation to the controller
period

01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
and take out the thing about if it's
 
01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
possible to cure we just read if we left
 
01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
it like that and then left three and
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
that would make them consistent I think
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
that would solve the problem
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry you I didn't mean to interrupt
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
you but I just wanted to catch that
 
01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:52.790 align:start position:0%
you but I just wanted to catch that
before

01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the question and it was
 
01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
very well timed as that was the end of
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
what I had prepared to say but happy to
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
take any questions from any members of
 
01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative stapled
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.370 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
you guys got a lot of work to do and it
 
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
sounds like the the bucket of work is
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
full at the brim already so when I look
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
at the financial note and it's got zeros
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
in it and indeterminable was there a
 
01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
communication gap on this bill relative
 
01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:28.139 align:start position:0%
to your input to finance to provide some
 
01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
better estimate of cost relative to the
 
01:29:33.290 --> 01:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
immense amount of additional work that
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
is possible here
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's an issue of a
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
communication breakdown I think it's
 
01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
more I think it's important to
 
01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
understand how we approach fiscal notes
 
01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
when we receive a request for them so
 
01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
anticipating the amount of increased
 
01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:48.950 align:start position:0%
anticipating the amount of increased
work

01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
that this bill will result in isn't
 
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
possible we don't know there could be a
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
thousand new complaints a year there
 
01:29:59.330 --> 01:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
could be zero you just don't know and so
 
01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
the number of resources that it will
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
take to carry out these obligations are
 
01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
indeterminable at the time that we're
 
01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
giving the fiscal note what we do is we
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
look at a bill and we try to ask
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
ourselves the question does this have
 
01:30:15.530 --> 01:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
the potential to significantly increase
 
01:30:18.649 --> 01:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
our work and do we have the ability to
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
measure what that increase will be if
 
01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
you know if it requires something like
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
you know the AG now has an annual report
 
01:30:28.970 --> 01:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
that it needs to make and it's a once a
 
01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
year thing and it's you know
 
01:30:32.330 --> 01:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
quantifiable as you know we just have
 
01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
this one task that we can assign to one
 
01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
person to complete once a year you
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
probably don't need additional resources
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
to do that you probably can find you
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
know a way to shift things around so
 
01:30:44.570 --> 01:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
that one person can write that report
 
01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
but when you're talking about adding a
 
01:30:48.890 --> 01:30:48.900 align:start position:0%
whole new category especially I mean
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
this is an entire new chapter that would
 
01:30:52.850 --> 01:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
now be the responsibility of the bureau
 
01:30:55.370 --> 01:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
any violation of this chapter in any
 
01:30:57.169 --> 01:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
form would be our responsibility to
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
investigate uh to respond to and to
 
01:31:01.850 --> 01:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
potentially prosecute or litigate if we
 
01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
couldn't you know solve the violation
 
01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:04.970 align:start position:0%
couldn't you know solve the violation
otherwise

01:31:04.970 --> 01:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
01:31:07.129 --> 01:31:07.139 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to determine what those
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
numbers of dollars that you would put
 
01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
into you know human beings to enforce
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
this would be at this time we just don't
 
01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.050 align:start position:0%
this would be at this time we just don't
know

01:31:15.050 --> 01:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
yes representative Smith
 
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
um rather than a lengthy response I
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
think you could also point out to my
 
01:31:28.490 --> 01:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
colleague that in the fiscal note at the
 
01:31:30.890 --> 01:31:30.900 align:start position:0%
end of the methodology section you say
 
01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
the department assumes due to the
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
complexity of the review it would likely
 
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
require significant additional resources
 
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
so while you have zeros listed above I
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
think you make very clear in the
 
01:31:47.209 --> 01:31:47.219 align:start position:0%
methodology that this is not going to be
 
01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
for free that's right other questions
 
01:31:51.169 --> 01:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
for this witness yes representative
 
01:31:51.179 --> 01:31:52.129 align:start position:0%
for this witness yes representative
Perez

01:31:52.129 --> 01:31:52.139 align:start position:0%
Perez
 
01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
sure are there any
 
01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:57.950 align:start position:0%
sure are there any
um

01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
are there any options that you might be
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
receiving more
 
01:32:05.169 --> 01:32:05.179 align:start position:0%
help in your department
 
01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
again so I'm not privy to these
 
01:32:09.890 --> 01:32:09.900 align:start position:0%
conversations but the information that
 
01:32:11.689 --> 01:32:11.699 align:start position:0%
I've gotten from
 
01:32:13.010 --> 01:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
um some folks higher up at the Attorney
 
01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
General's office is that since my
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
testimony at the Senate there have been
 
01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
conversations specifically about adding
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
additional resources to the bureau to
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
address this issue I don't know what the
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
state of those conversations are or the
 
01:32:25.450 --> 01:32:25.460 align:start position:0%
likelihood that they come to fruition
 
01:32:27.649 --> 01:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
but I know the conversations are at
 
01:32:28.970 --> 01:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
least taking place
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
yes representative cutoff
 
01:32:34.729 --> 01:32:34.739 align:start position:0%
so if we both added in a clause to state
 
01:32:34.739 --> 01:32:36.110 align:start position:0%
so if we both added in a clause to state
that

01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
a private right of action would be a you
 
01:32:42.770 --> 01:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
know available under this as well as
 
01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
adding in
 
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
a potential fine of some sort such as
 
01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
the the consumer protection act
 
01:32:51.610 --> 01:32:51.620 align:start position:0%
currently has I think there's fines
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
differentiating in there I think it's
 
01:32:55.129 --> 01:32:55.139 align:start position:0%
between a thousand dollars or ten
 
01:32:56.689 --> 01:32:56.699 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars if there was some sort
 
01:32:59.330 --> 01:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
of fines like I guess that would help to
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
pay for additional Staffing would you
 
01:33:03.649 --> 01:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
agree that those two things may kind of
 
01:33:03.659 --> 01:33:04.490 align:start position:0%
agree that those two things may kind of
fix

01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
fix
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
the struggles that you're having
 
01:33:10.610 --> 01:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
so I would disagree with that and the so
 
01:33:12.970 --> 01:33:12.980 align:start position:0%
the the reason I disagree with that is
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
the way the bureau is currently funded
 
01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
through a consumer protection escrow
 
01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
account that is 100 funded by the
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection Bureau and the work
 
01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
that we do when we have fines and
 
01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
penalties or settlements with businesses
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
all that money goes into this escrow
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
account and it pays for the salary of
 
01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
every single person in the bureau but
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
there's a five million dollar cap on any
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
given time on that escrow account the
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
rest goes to the general fund so no we
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
can bring as many enforce and it's
 
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
always full
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
um so we could up the amount of money we
 
01:33:45.649 --> 01:33:45.659 align:start position:0%
bring in we wouldn't see an extra dollar
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
of that in order to fund another
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
position it would go to the general fund
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
and you would need to create the
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
positions in order to be able to so
 
01:33:54.050 --> 01:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
funding them is one problem but also
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
just creating the positions is another
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
so we don't currently have any positions
 
01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
that we would have the opportunity to
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
but I would like to actually just
 
01:34:07.129 --> 01:34:07.139 align:start position:0%
clarify one other thing to make sure
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
that everybody understands
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
um and I should have said this earlier
 
01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
the reason that there's no specific fine
 
01:34:18.169 --> 01:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
in here is the the way so in 358a which
 
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire's consumer protection
 
01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
act it says that any unfair and
 
01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
deceptive act or practice committed in
 
01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:25.860 align:start position:0%
the course of Commerce shall be
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
violation of the statute and then
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
there's rights and remedies in that
 
01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
statute if there's an unfair and
 
01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
deceptive act or practice that's
 
01:34:33.530 --> 01:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
committed in Commerce it includes a ten
 
01:34:35.810 --> 01:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar civil penalty uh per
 
01:34:38.930 --> 01:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
violation that can be brought so this
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
statute like many other statutes that
 
01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:43.380 align:start position:0%
have been brought is not specifically
 
01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's not going to live in 358 a but it
 
01:34:47.930 --> 01:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
Loops it back and says a violation of
 
01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
this chapter like many other laws on our
 
01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
books like the health club statute that
 
01:34:53.930 --> 01:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
I talked about earlier the condominium
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
statute that I talked about
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
um not the condominium sorry but health
 
01:34:59.689 --> 01:34:59.699 align:start position:0%
clubs martial arts several other areas
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
Loop it back and say any violation of
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
this chapter like this chapter is an
 
01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
unfair and deceptive act or practice so
 
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
the Civil penalties for unfair and
 
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
deceptive Acts or practices would be
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
applicable to a violation of this
 
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
okay so two two follow-up things if I
 
01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
may thank you for taking my question so
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
I guess the first one would be that we
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
could create those positions right and
 
01:35:23.810 --> 01:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
we could also increase the cap on that
 
01:35:26.209 --> 01:35:26.219 align:start position:0%
you know from the current 5 million
 
01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
um and then the second part of that
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
would be so if everything kind of links
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
back to that consumer protection act
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
then would a private right of action be
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
available already under the consumer
 
01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
protection act or is that specific part
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
excluded but the ten thousand dollar
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
fine isn't excluded great question I'm
 
01:35:47.470 --> 01:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
really glad you asked so
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
358a includes a specific section that
 
01:35:54.169 --> 01:35:54.179 align:start position:0%
creates a private right of action for
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
unfair and deceptive acts for practices
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
that are committed in Commerce and the
 
01:35:59.810 --> 01:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
remedies are different so you get
 
01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
certain remedies if you're a the state
 
01:36:03.530 --> 01:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
bringing this case and then there's
 
01:36:04.669 --> 01:36:04.679 align:start position:0%
different remedies if you're an
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
individual brain so under the consumer
 
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
a private right of action exists and
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
there's a defined set of Remedies but
 
01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
the way this statute is worded is
 
01:36:17.629 --> 01:36:17.639 align:start position:0%
specifically says that nothing shall be
 
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
construed to create a private right of
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
action for the enforcement of this
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
section I think that that is very strong
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
evidence that the private right of
 
01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
action in 358a would not be available as
 
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
currently worded if this bill were to
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
although it would be an unfair and
 
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
deceptive act or practice if you violate
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
it this bill is enforced exclusively by
 
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and there is no
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
private right of action it basically
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
creates an exemption to the private
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
right of action in 358a and says the
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
violations of this chapter would not be
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
subject to that prior right of action
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness see
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much thank you
 
01:36:56.930 --> 01:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
you're next going to call on Karen uh
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Karen soucy I'm
 
01:37:25.129 --> 01:37:25.139 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of the XI and Finney
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
Capital group and we are representing
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
ctia that is the Wireless Communications
 
01:37:30.239 --> 01:37:35.209 align:start position:0%
ctia that is the Wireless Communications
Association

01:37:35.209 --> 01:37:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
I've submitted testimony of Jake lestock
 
01:37:40.129 --> 01:37:40.139 align:start position:0%
who is employed by ctia but certainly
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
not going to read that I'm just going to
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
summarize their position
 
01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:44.209 align:start position:0%
summarize their position
um

01:37:44.209 --> 01:37:44.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:46.330 --> 01:37:46.340 align:start position:0%
we understand certainly that
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
data and privacy of that data is very
 
01:37:49.199 --> 01:37:50.629 align:start position:0%
data and privacy of that data is very
important

01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:37:53.930 --> 01:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
we have concerns that as we move forward
 
01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:54.530 align:start position:0%
we have concerns that as we move forward
um

01:37:54.530 --> 01:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
that we're approaching state by state
 
01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:58.910 align:start position:0%
that we're approaching state by state
regulations

01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
which can become very burdensome and
 
01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
confusing when it comes to compliance
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
for these providers
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
we certainly
 
01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:08.689 align:start position:0%
we certainly
um

01:38:08.689 --> 01:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
support the federal efforts that are
 
01:38:12.250 --> 01:38:12.260 align:start position:0%
ongoing right now
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
but again we understand there is a
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
vacuum there's a void right now and that
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
steps from states are moving forward on
 
01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
their own all that we simply ask is that
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
when you consider moving this
 
01:38:25.570 --> 01:38:25.580 align:start position:0%
legislation forward
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
that you seek probably the Connecticut
 
01:38:30.649 --> 01:38:30.659 align:start position:0%
model is my understanding based on
 
01:38:33.050 --> 01:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
conversations with the providers that
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
you try to align it as close as possible
 
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
to that model again we're just seeking
 
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this witness yes
 
01:38:47.209 --> 01:38:47.219 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you it
 
01:38:49.010 --> 01:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
was under my impression that this bill
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
was the Connecticut model is that
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
correct it's my understanding that it is
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
very close to it I don't have the
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
information to specify where it Strays
 
01:39:02.810 --> 01:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
from the Connecticut model but again the
 
01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
providers are seeking as close to that
 
01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
as possible it would be helpful if you
 
01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
could send that information over to us I
 
01:39:10.250 --> 01:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
certainly will thank you
 
01:39:12.590 --> 01:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness saying
 
01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
none thank you thanks
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Lynn in committee
 
01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
members I am Rick Fabrizio director of
 
01:39:45.950 --> 01:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
communications and public policy for the
 
01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:48.659 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association New
 
01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Statewide Chamber of Commerce
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
I submitted my testimony previously so
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just gonna going to offer a brief
 
01:39:57.410 --> 01:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
synopsis of that
 
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 255 was crafted with
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
industry support which assure helps
 
01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
assure practical regulation of Commerce
 
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
it exempts smaller businesses protecting
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
them from compliance cost most simply
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to bear
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
it is closely modeled on legislation
 
01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:16.860 align:start position:0%
recently passed in Virginia Colorado
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Utah and Iowa which just
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
passed their law last month all five
 
01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
laws are very similar and form an
 
01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
emerging consensus of what should be in
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive Privacy Law
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
aligning State legislation in the
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
absence of Federal Regulation will make
 
01:40:36.169 --> 01:40:36.179 align:start position:0%
compliance easier for businesses engaged
 
01:40:38.090 --> 01:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
in interstate commerce
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
by passing Senate Bill 255 New Hampshire
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
can achieve a long-sought comprehensive
 
01:40:45.530 --> 01:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
Community data Privacy Law that balances
 
01:40:48.530 --> 01:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
consumer and business interest with the
 
01:40:51.770 --> 01:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
confidence it is past muster in the five
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
previous States based on some of the
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
remarks that we've heard today clearly
 
01:40:59.330 --> 01:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities to improve this
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislation I would point out that the
 
01:41:04.010 --> 01:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Law to a question earlier
 
01:41:07.129 --> 01:41:07.139 align:start position:0%
about the exemptions of the 100 000 25
 
01:41:08.689 --> 01:41:08.699 align:start position:0%
000 that is based on the prior calendar
 
01:41:08.699 --> 01:41:10.610 align:start position:0%
000 that is based on the prior calendar
year

01:41:10.610 --> 01:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
um and also in Connecticut
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
violations would default to their
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
consumer Privacy Act which has uh fines
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
or violations
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
not unlike what the situation would be
 
01:41:25.370 --> 01:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I'm sorry as a private
 
01:41:27.110 --> 01:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
right of action it does not have a
 
01:41:28.850 --> 01:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
private reaction right of action as Ryan
 
01:41:30.649 --> 01:41:30.659 align:start position:0%
Harkins had pointed out that one of the
 
01:41:32.450 --> 01:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
biggest stumbling blocks to pass in
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
comprehensive comprehensive privacy Acts
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
is the private right of action so while
 
01:41:41.149 --> 01:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
there may be improvements made to this
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
bill if it does not Advance New
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will not have a comprehensive
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
data protection act and consumers will
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
still lack those protections I'm happy
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
to take any questions you may have
 
01:41:54.590 --> 01:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none great thank you thank you
 
01:42:00.250 --> 01:42:00.260 align:start position:0%
um Andrew
 
01:42:02.209 --> 01:42:02.219 align:start position:0%
kinshaw I hope I'm pronouncing that
 
01:42:05.930 --> 01:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
correctly uh from uh
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
State privacy and Society coalition
 
01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
is that better
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
um represent the state privacy and
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%

01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
we work on these in in all 50 states and
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
I have a background as a privacy
 
01:42:45.709 --> 01:42:45.719 align:start position:0%
compliance attorney helping companies
 
01:42:48.189 --> 01:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
work through various State privacy laws
 
01:42:50.689 --> 01:42:50.699 align:start position:0%
we have written testimony which which
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
I'll submit uh shortly after this here
 
01:42:58.669 --> 01:42:58.679 align:start position:0%
we do support uh the bill as written and
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
would ask that no changes be made to the
 
01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
the substantive Provisions here instead
 
01:43:05.450 --> 01:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
of going through my testimony I thought
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
it might be helpful to answer some of
 
01:43:08.209 --> 01:43:08.219 align:start position:0%
the questions that have come up
 
01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
throughout the hearing particularly as
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
they relate to thresholds you know the
 
01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
other states to your question Mr chair
 
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
about what the other states do the
 
01:43:20.810 --> 01:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand consumers uh in a
 
01:43:22.810 --> 01:43:22.820 align:start position:0%
calendar year is very very standard
 
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
across all other states at this point
 
01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
there are some differences around the
 
01:43:30.410 --> 01:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
that second set of thresholds with the
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
revenue and the number of consumers the
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
states differ a little bit there but
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
that hundred thousand is fairly
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
consistent we would not necessarily have
 
01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
a position on that we think that that's
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
an issue for States each state to
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
resolve on its own but just for
 
01:43:48.729 --> 01:43:48.739 align:start position:0%
clarity's sake wanted to point that out
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander your question
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
about the the fcra exemption that
 
01:43:56.090 --> 01:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
language about reliability and consumer
 
01:43:57.470 --> 01:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
behavior that comes from the definition
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
of a consumer report from that act so
 
01:44:02.209 --> 01:44:02.219 align:start position:0%
that's why that language is there just
 
01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
reinforcing that I want to be clear that
 
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
that this law would be stronger than
 
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
California there's been a lot of talk
 
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:11.639 align:start position:0%
about the comparison today for some of
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
the reasons previously mentioned but
 
01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:16.860 align:start position:0%
California's law does not have an opt-in
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
for sensitive data it does not require
 
01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:23.300 align:start position:0%
at this time data detection assessments
 
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
and so and and you know really
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
importantly this bill is much clearer
 
01:44:31.850 --> 01:44:31.860 align:start position:0%
and easier to read and we believe that
 
01:44:34.129 --> 01:44:34.139 align:start position:0%
when bills are clear compliance
 
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
increases right businesses don't have to
 
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
hire privacy attorneys uh to tell them
 
01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
what it means they're able to read the
 
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
bill and implement it so you know we
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
believe that this is a stronger model I
 
01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
think the other the other issue with
 
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
California's laws that it is really a
 
01:44:52.490 --> 01:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
moving Target and it's constantly
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
changing this bill is built to be
 
01:44:58.609 --> 01:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
sustainable over time and be a framework
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
that can adapt to new technologies and
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
new issues that arise but to do so in a
 
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
way that is comprehensible both to
 
01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
Consumers and to businesses so we feel
 
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh that this bill provides actually a
 
01:45:14.209 --> 01:45:14.219 align:start position:0%
stronger approach it is based on the
 
01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
Connecticut model which I think is is
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
generally excuse me considered to be the
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
the strongest State Privacy Law in the
 
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
country three this bill in in New
 
01:45:27.649 --> 01:45:27.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is at the cusp of of passing
 
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
what would be the eighth state to to
 
01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
pass comprehensive privacy legislation
 
01:45:35.209 --> 01:45:35.219 align:start position:0%
we've already seen uh Virginia Colorado
 
01:45:39.490 --> 01:45:39.500 align:start position:0%
Connecticut uh in Utah pass uh recently
 
01:45:43.129 --> 01:45:43.139 align:start position:0%
Iowa has passed Indiana's bill is
 
01:45:45.890 --> 01:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
sitting on the governor's desk we also
 
01:45:48.109 --> 01:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
expect Tennessee Montana and Texas to
 
01:45:50.450 --> 01:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
pass a version of this bill as well in
 
01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
the in the coming months here so
 
01:45:55.129 --> 01:45:55.139 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think I live in this
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
region I think it also makes sense to
 
01:45:59.149 --> 01:45:59.159 align:start position:0%
follow Connecticut and that having a
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
regional approach makes a lot of sense I
 
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
know how closely intertwined the the
 
01:46:06.050 --> 01:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
economies in in the Six States in New
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
England are I think it makes a lot of
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
sense for uh New Hampshire to adopt the
 
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
Connecticut approach and be a leader in
 
01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
helping New England move to a model
 
01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:18.850 align:start position:0%
helping New England move to a model
where

01:46:18.850 --> 01:46:18.860 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:46:20.930 --> 01:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
businesses that operate in between
 
01:46:24.290 --> 01:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
states are able to do so with consistent
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
expectations and those of us who are
 
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
consumers who frequently travel between
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
states can do so with consistent
 
01:46:34.609 --> 01:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
expectations of what our privacy rights
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
are as well
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
um questions uh yes representative
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
so I know that you stated that the
 
01:46:43.850 --> 01:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
Connecticut model would be a good model
 
01:46:46.729 --> 01:46:46.739 align:start position:0%
to follow and that
 
01:46:48.590 --> 01:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
they were using a hundred thousand
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
annually as their Baseline for it
 
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
however you also stated that you don't
 
01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
want any changes made to this
 
01:46:57.770 --> 01:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
legislation I just wanted to point out
 
01:46:59.810 --> 01:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
that this legislation does currently
 
01:47:01.070 --> 01:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
just say a hundred thousand and it
 
01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't Define annually so it could be
 
01:47:06.649 --> 01:47:06.659 align:start position:0%
in virtuity sure and I said to to the
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
substantive provisions of the bill we
 
01:47:11.209 --> 01:47:11.219 align:start position:0%
wouldn't ask for any changes so if this
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
committee or the state wanted to change
 
01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:15.719 align:start position:0%
that language I think that's perfectly
 
01:47:17.450 --> 01:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
fine to to move to within a calendar
 
01:47:19.609 --> 01:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
year that's pretty consistent with what
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
other states are doing other questions
 
01:47:22.729 --> 01:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:25.380 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much sir next
 
01:47:27.890 --> 01:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call on Matt Schwartz from
 
01:47:36.169 --> 01:47:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
chair Vice chair and members of the
 
01:47:39.050 --> 01:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for allowing me to
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
testify today my name is Matt Schwartz
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm a policy analyst with Consumer
 
01:47:45.649 --> 01:47:45.659 align:start position:0%
Reports uh if amended in a few key ways
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
we do support today's legislation
 
01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
in our view privacy legislation that
 
01:47:52.609 --> 01:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
relies on opt-out model such as this
 
01:47:52.619 --> 01:47:53.450 align:start position:0%
relies on opt-out model such as this
bill

01:47:53.450 --> 01:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:47:56.209 --> 01:47:56.219 align:start position:0%
uh must add a minimum include the
 
01:47:58.970 --> 01:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
provision for Universal opt-out
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise consumers are forced to
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
navigate an untenable complicated
 
01:48:06.830 --> 01:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
ecosystem of privacy notices opt-out
 
01:48:09.169 --> 01:48:09.179 align:start position:0%
requests and verification on an
 
01:48:10.729 --> 01:48:10.739 align:start position:0%
individual basis with each of the
 
01:48:13.010 --> 01:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
businesses that they interact with
 
01:48:14.930 --> 01:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
which is a number that that could be in
 
01:48:19.310 --> 01:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
the thousands section 507 h42
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
and 507 H5 of this act addressed this
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
issue by requiring that covered
 
01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
businesses allow
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
consumers or their authorized agents to
 
01:48:30.530 --> 01:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
opt out from a controller's processing
 
01:48:32.689 --> 01:48:32.699 align:start position:0%
of their personal data
 
01:48:35.149 --> 01:48:35.159 align:start position:0%
privacy researchers and Advocates and
 
01:48:36.890 --> 01:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
Publishers have already created the
 
01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:38.930 align:start position:0%
Publishers have already created the
technology

01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
that would fit the bill for an
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
authorized agent under this act
 
01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
including the global privacy control
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
as well as Consumer Reports its own
 
01:48:49.729 --> 01:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
permission slip app both of which make
 
01:48:51.530 --> 01:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
the opt-out model more workable for
 
01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:53.330 align:start position:0%
the opt-out model more workable for
consumers

01:48:53.330 --> 01:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
however we do suggest a few tweaks to
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
improve the protections of this bill
 
01:49:01.129 --> 01:49:01.139 align:start position:0%
our main concern at this juncture
 
01:49:03.290 --> 01:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
relates to attorney general enforcement
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh several weeks ago
 
01:49:09.229 --> 01:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
and again today we heard from the AG's
 
01:49:10.970 --> 01:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
office who testified that they would not
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
be able to enforce the bill uh given
 
01:49:15.169 --> 01:49:15.179 align:start position:0%
current resources
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
given that our two policy
 
01:49:19.729 --> 01:49:19.739 align:start position:0%
recommendations in order of preference
 
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
would be to either include a private
 
01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
right of action in this bill
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
or barring that or in addition to that
 
01:49:29.090 --> 01:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
include substantial new Appropriations
 
01:49:32.689 --> 01:49:32.699 align:start position:0%
to support robust AG enforcement
 
01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
we also suggest that the drafters remove
 
01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
the right to cure from the attorney
 
01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
general enforcement
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
section otherwise businesses can kind of
 
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
break the law with no punishment so long
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
as they respond to an AG request within
 
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
I believe it's 60 days in this
 
01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:49.430 align:start position:0%
I believe it's 60 days in this
legislation

01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
which would only further strain the he's
 
01:49:54.649 --> 01:49:54.659 align:start position:0%
ability to stretch its resources and
 
01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
enforce this act efficiently
 
01:50:00.649 --> 01:50:00.659 align:start position:0%
without these changes there would not be
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
meaningful accountability mechanisms to
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
back up the substantial requirements in
 
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:50:08.450 --> 01:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
we have a few other recommendations that
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
are further specified in our written
 
01:50:13.930 --> 01:50:13.940 align:start position:0%
testimony I'll just go over them briefly
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
given the time surface in your written
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
testimony I think we will read that but
 
01:50:20.510 --> 01:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
I yeah okay thank you
 
01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:50:26.639 --> 01:50:27.410 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
um next I'm going to call on Matt Lenz
 
01:50:39.410 --> 01:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:40.970 --> 01:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you chair members of the committee
 
01:50:43.490 --> 01:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Matt Lenz I represent BSA
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
the software Alliance BSA is the leading
 
01:50:47.330 --> 01:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
advocate for the global software
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
industry our members are business to
 
01:50:50.570 --> 01:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
business companies that create
 
01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
technology products and services that
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
other companies use uh including Cloud
 
01:50:56.689 --> 01:50:56.699 align:start position:0%
Computing Services and workplace
 
01:50:58.850 --> 01:50:58.860 align:start position:0%
collaboration tools I know that you are
 
01:51:00.649 --> 01:51:00.659 align:start position:0%
running short on time here so I want to
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
let you know we provided written
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
testimony uh yesterday we submitted that
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
so you should have that uh our four
 
01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
major points and I won't go into detail
 
01:51:10.729 --> 01:51:10.739 align:start position:0%
but basically really support the bill uh
 
01:51:13.010 --> 01:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
appreciate the sponsor's approach on the
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
controller processor distinction why we
 
01:51:17.149 --> 01:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
have members that are controllers we
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
have many of our members are the
 
01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
processors uh so we represent sort of
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
the process or provision of this bill uh
 
01:51:25.490 --> 01:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
really support the bills uh goal of
 
01:51:27.410 --> 01:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
interoperability with other state laws
 
01:51:29.810 --> 01:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
we think that's very important in uh
 
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
promoting a consistent approach to
 
01:51:34.010 --> 01:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
Consumer privacy uh and we do support
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
the current enforcement mechanism
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
through the Attorney General's office uh
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
in our testimony we do request one
 
01:51:43.609 --> 01:51:43.619 align:start position:0%
change related to subcontractors right
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
now it gives the ability for a
 
01:51:47.330 --> 01:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
controller to object uh to a
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
subcontractor we would prefer that that
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
would be a provision to notify uh the
 
01:51:54.770 --> 01:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
controller when a processor uses a
 
01:51:57.649 --> 01:51:57.659 align:start position:0%
subcontractor we do that because uh
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
processors could use dozens of
 
01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
subcontractors when there's an issue
 
01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
that comes up related to a security
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
breach or a conflict Etc so it makes it
 
01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
a little bit funky to try to uh try to
 
01:52:12.169 --> 01:52:12.179 align:start position:0%
do that in a timely space with that
 
01:52:13.609 --> 01:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions questions
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
01:52:18.050 --> 01:52:18.060 align:start position:0%

please sure of course they didn't know
 
01:52:38.930 --> 01:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
it sir David Miller okay thank you
 
01:52:41.810 --> 01:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
um I work as a privacy engineer I'm out
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of any employer or any
 
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
clients I'm simply a concerned citizen
 
01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:47.410 align:start position:0%
clients I'm simply a concerned citizen
that

01:52:47.410 --> 01:52:47.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:50.209 --> 01:52:50.219 align:start position:0%
is very interested in the series of
 
01:52:52.370 --> 01:52:52.380 align:start position:0%
privacy laws modeled after California
 
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
and Connecticut and the European Union
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh regulation and would like to be of
 
01:52:58.689 --> 01:52:58.699 align:start position:0%
any assistance that I can
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
as a technical worker who implements uh
 
01:53:05.810 --> 01:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
privacy uh regulations and also has
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
experience as a pen tester meaning that
 
01:53:11.149 --> 01:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
I have worked in European companies in
 
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
the European Union prior to the passage
 
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
of gdpr and I can testify that with a
 
01:53:20.810 --> 01:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
lack of strong and clear Financial
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
incentives like the four percent of
 
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
global annual turnover maximum penalty
 
01:53:27.850 --> 01:53:27.860 align:start position:0%
offered in the gdpr
 
01:53:31.689 --> 01:53:31.699 align:start position:0%
uh European companies and European
 
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries of American or
 
01:53:35.770 --> 01:53:35.780 align:start position:0%
International companies were not
 
01:53:38.570 --> 01:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
minimizing data as had been required
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
from the 1995 data protection Direct of
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
the European Union and so I would like
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
to thank the representatives here who
 
01:53:48.890 --> 01:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
have voiced concern about the bottleneck
 
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
created uh by the lack of a private
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
right of action except through the
 
01:53:57.410 --> 01:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection Bureau uh by the
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
discretion of the Attorney General to
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
pursue cases and by the lack of a kind
 
01:54:05.090 --> 01:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
of clear uh Financial penalties offered
 
01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
by the California referenda as to how
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
this bill would actually be treated by
 
01:54:15.590 --> 01:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
um companies responsible for
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
implementing the restrictions and
 
01:54:21.169 --> 01:54:21.179 align:start position:0%
auditing of their own behavior
 
01:54:21.179 --> 01:54:23.510 align:start position:0%
auditing of their own behavior
additionally

01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
um I think it was representative Manos
 
01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.370 --> 01:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
um the companies sorry representative
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
Andrews uh voice concerned about whether
 
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
the companies could actually be expected
 
01:54:40.850 --> 01:54:40.860 align:start position:0%
to delete data after the facts
 
01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:44.340 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate uh Mr Hawkins
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
um testimony that uh the the passage of
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
any law about this would be helpful to
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the uh that the companies
 
01:54:56.570 --> 01:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
would have some obligation
 
01:54:59.209 --> 01:54:59.219 align:start position:0%
to minimize data but I'd like to point
 
01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
out that
 
01:55:03.050 --> 01:55:03.060 align:start position:0%
um from auditing experience in the EU
 
01:55:07.609 --> 01:55:07.619 align:start position:0%
there is a lack of likelihood that uh
 
01:55:09.649 --> 01:55:09.659 align:start position:0%
enforcement would be feasible and I'd
 
01:55:11.930 --> 01:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
like to if anyone has any questions
 
01:55:13.129 --> 01:55:13.139 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative yes
 
01:55:17.689 --> 01:55:17.699 align:start position:0%
so are you would you be in support of
 
01:55:19.490 --> 01:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
this bill if it allowed for a private
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
right of action I would in that case yes
 
01:55:26.330 --> 01:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
I'd like to mention to the committee uh
 
01:55:30.109 --> 01:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
a couple of things uh one of them uh is
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
the U.S approach to Privacy Law while it
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
has to respect certain First Amendment
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
constraints mentioned by Mr Hawkins like
 
01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
the right to collect and redistribute
 
01:55:48.410 --> 01:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
data not this prevents the US from
 
01:55:49.850 --> 01:55:49.860 align:start position:0%
taking a strong approach as a European
 
01:55:52.850 --> 01:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
Union but the European Union approach
 
01:55:56.209 --> 01:55:56.219 align:start position:0%
has been to make all collection
 
01:55:58.070 --> 01:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
processing and redistribution of data
 
01:55:59.629 --> 01:55:59.639 align:start position:0%
for valuable consideration or any other
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
purpose subject to opt in whereas the
 
01:56:04.970 --> 01:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
Virginia Connecticut and New Hampshire
 
01:56:08.209 --> 01:56:08.219 align:start position:0%
proposals are opt out while we can't
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
take so strong a stance it's my
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
understanding that the reason that a lot
 
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
of the internationally operating U.S
 
01:56:18.290 --> 01:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
tech companies are interested in getting
 
01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
more and more states to have privacy
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
regulations is not just for the
 
01:56:23.450 --> 01:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
confidence of U.S consumers but to
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
ensure that their businesses overseas
 
01:56:26.689 --> 01:56:26.699 align:start position:0%
are not disrupted
 
01:56:26.699 --> 01:56:28.149 align:start position:0%
are not disrupted
because

01:56:28.149 --> 01:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
the exchange of data with their U.S
 
01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
servers and their U.S subsidiaries
 
01:56:36.770 --> 01:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
requires that the European Union not
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
sanction them and uh the agreements made
 
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh between uh the uh U.S Department of
 
01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
Commerce and the European Union have
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
been struck down a number of times as
 
01:56:51.050 --> 01:56:51.060 align:start position:0%
not meeting the standards of European
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
law especially in light of the Snowden
 
01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
Revelations so um with respect to
 
01:56:58.250 --> 01:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative uh manus's uh question
 
01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
about whether tech companies in the
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
United States would in as more and more
 
01:57:05.390 --> 01:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
States passed privacy laws simply opt to
 
01:57:07.970 --> 01:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
implement the strongest of them what
 
01:57:10.250 --> 01:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
we've been seeing instead in civil
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
society and just by watching uh the
 
01:57:15.050 --> 01:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
progress here is that simultaneously
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
there's a game going on here where uh
 
01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists with all due respect to
 
01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
all of you
 
01:57:26.510 --> 01:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
um uh are coming to a lot of State uh
 
01:57:29.089 --> 01:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
hearings in order to push these various
 
01:57:29.099 --> 01:57:30.229 align:start position:0%
hearings in order to push these various
bills

01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
possibly in the hopes that a federal
 
01:57:35.689 --> 01:57:35.699 align:start position:0%
bill would be modeled on the middle or
 
01:57:38.089 --> 01:57:38.099 align:start position:0%
weakest of these and therefore I
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
encourage you all when considering the
 
01:57:41.209 --> 01:57:41.219 align:start position:0%
wording in this bill in its comparison
 
01:57:43.250 --> 01:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
to other states
 
01:57:45.649 --> 01:57:45.659 align:start position:0%
that one may play into this ensuring
 
01:57:49.609 --> 01:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
that a federal Bill if passed
 
01:57:51.470 --> 01:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
um protects the rights of New Hampshire
 
01:57:54.649 --> 01:57:54.659 align:start position:0%
consumers as much as possible rather
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
than relying on another State's
 
01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
regulation to play that role right
 
01:58:03.050 --> 01:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
01:58:04.970 --> 01:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much sir
 
01:58:09.050 --> 01:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Neil Kirk former
 
01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:16.010 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Neil Kirk former
representative

01:58:16.010 --> 01:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:20.209 --> 01:58:20.219 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman excuse me
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
good morning or good afternoon Mr
 
01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee for
 
01:58:25.550 --> 01:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Neil Kirk I live in Ware
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm representing myself and yes I
 
01:58:29.209 --> 01:58:29.219 align:start position:0%
was a former representative for many
 
01:58:29.219 --> 01:58:30.770 align:start position:0%
was a former representative for many
years

01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:31.430 align:start position:0%
years
um

01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
I would like to say I come in support of
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
this bill because I've been very
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
concerned about privacy for decades
 
01:58:41.169 --> 01:58:41.179 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately I cannot
 
01:58:44.689 --> 01:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
this is one of the most complex pieces
 
01:58:48.169 --> 01:58:48.179 align:start position:0%
of legislation that I've seen
 
01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
and today while your questions in the
 
01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:53.410 align:start position:0%
and today while your questions in the
testimony

01:58:53.410 --> 01:58:53.420 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
got into this it merely scratched the
 
01:58:58.729 --> 01:58:58.739 align:start position:0%
surface to really understand this bill
 
01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
will take a great deal of time
 
01:59:03.050 --> 01:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
and a great deal of effort by either a
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or a study committee
 
01:59:09.770 --> 01:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
and I hope you will do that because the
 
01:59:11.689 --> 01:59:11.699 align:start position:0%
ramifications and I don't understand
 
01:59:14.570 --> 01:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
this fully myself need to be understood
 
01:59:16.850 --> 01:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
and is usually the responsibility of a
 
01:59:18.530 --> 01:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
house Committee in the legislative
 
01:59:22.250 --> 01:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
process to make sure that that happens
 
01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:25.790 align:start position:0%
process to make sure that that happens
um

01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:28.490 --> 01:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
the bill does a few very important
 
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
things but they're very small and con in
 
01:59:32.689 --> 01:59:32.699 align:start position:0%
comparison with the total interest of
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
privacy it does give a person
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.450 --> 02:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:07.729 --> 02:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
well let me go on
 
02:00:07.739 --> 02:00:17.030 align:start position:0%
well let me go on
um

02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:19.729 --> 02:00:19.739 align:start position:0%
in section H3
 
02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
that's on page four line 31.
 
02:00:27.950 --> 02:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
there is a whole slew of exclusions
 
02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
There are 16 types of data that are
 
02:00:34.189 --> 02:00:34.199 align:start position:0%
excluded Health Care banking
 
02:00:34.199 --> 02:00:34.970 align:start position:0%
excluded Health Care banking
Etc

02:00:34.970 --> 02:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
um six entities kinds of entities that
 
02:00:42.770 --> 02:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
are excluded uh non-profits Higher
 
02:00:47.450 --> 02:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
Education Health Care and government
 
02:00:50.109 --> 02:00:50.119 align:start position:0%
so this really applies to a relatively
 
02:00:54.229 --> 02:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
limited group of organizations because
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
so much has been Exempted
 
02:00:57.599 --> 02:01:00.229 align:start position:0%
so much has been Exempted
um

02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:02.990 --> 02:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
the Privacy notices required by this
 
02:01:05.930 --> 02:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
bill are important
 
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
but there are problems with them first
 
02:01:09.950 --> 02:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
of all they're very complex
 
02:01:12.410 --> 02:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
and secondly every company is going to
 
02:01:13.609 --> 02:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
have its own
 
02:01:16.729 --> 02:01:16.739 align:start position:0%
now if you're like me and you go through
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
you go to a website
 
02:01:22.729 --> 02:01:22.739 align:start position:0%
you just don't have time to read the
 
02:01:24.830 --> 02:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
Privacy notices and to read all of the
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions
 
02:01:30.129 --> 02:01:30.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:33.169 --> 02:01:33.179 align:start position:0%
now we're going to have other options if
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
and they would be different for each
 
02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:38.330 align:start position:0%
and they would be different for each
company

02:01:38.330 --> 02:01:38.340 align:start position:0%
company
 
02:01:40.729 --> 02:01:40.739 align:start position:0%
and it would be very difficult for us as
 
02:01:42.290 --> 02:01:42.300 align:start position:0%
a practical matter
 
02:01:44.089 --> 02:01:44.099 align:start position:0%
to know that they exist and to take
 
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
advantage of them
 
02:01:48.109 --> 02:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
at the very least
 
02:01:50.450 --> 02:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
this bill needs to be modified so that
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
whatever the format of opt-in and opt
 
02:01:55.729 --> 02:01:55.739 align:start position:0%
out and get information is going to be
 
02:01:57.709 --> 02:01:57.719 align:start position:0%
offered to people as meeting their
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
expectations of privacy it's done in a
 
02:02:03.169 --> 02:02:03.179 align:start position:0%
uniform way and very simply so that
 
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
people can see it and act immediately on
 
02:02:07.129 --> 02:02:07.139 align:start position:0%
it and that we don't have to think that
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
every time we go to a website we have to
 
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
do a different investigation to find out
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
what our rights are and how we can
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:17.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
as has been noted there's a problem with
 
02:02:21.649 --> 02:02:21.659 align:start position:0%
this bill because it's enforceable only
 
02:02:23.629 --> 02:02:23.639 align:start position:0%
by the AG and because there are no
 
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
Financial penalties
 
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
and as somebody pointed out the AG has
 
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
to give an opportunity for correction
 
02:02:36.050 --> 02:02:36.060 align:start position:0%
before it he can take any action so
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
the incentive for me as a company is to
 
02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
do business as usual and if I get caught
 
02:02:43.250 --> 02:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
okay I'll correct what I've done that
 
02:02:44.689 --> 02:02:44.699 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense and I hope this
 
02:02:46.729 --> 02:02:46.739 align:start position:0%
committee will will change that a
 
02:02:48.169 --> 02:02:48.179 align:start position:0%
private right of action would be very
 
02:02:50.570 --> 02:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
important because after all I feel that
 
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
I've been offended by this action of a
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
company but the AG doesn't for whatever
 
02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
reason either because he doesn't have
 
02:02:59.810 --> 02:02:59.820 align:start position:0%
resources or he and I disagree I want to
 
02:03:02.930 --> 02:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
take my my concern to court I can't
 
02:03:05.209 --> 02:03:05.219 align:start position:0%
not under this bill
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
that that I think needs to change too
 
02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:09.589 align:start position:0%
that that I think needs to change too
um

02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:12.109 --> 02:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
an an opt
 
02:03:16.609 --> 02:03:16.619 align:start position:0%
well I'm not really sure whether it's
 
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
opt-in or opt out
 
02:03:21.770 --> 02:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
public policy should favor
 
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
and opt out as a default so that our
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
data is protected unless we choose to
 
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
give the company the right to use it
 
02:03:35.450 --> 02:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
the Assumption behind this bill is that
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
the data that we give a company doesn't
 
02:03:39.649 --> 02:03:39.659 align:start position:0%
belong to us anymore it's the company's
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
data and they can do with it what they
 
02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
want and this bill says wait
 
02:03:46.910 --> 02:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
we the companies will give up that right
 
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
in certain circumstances because there's
 
02:03:52.189 --> 02:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
a tsunami of concern about privacy and
 
02:03:54.050 --> 02:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
we don't want consumers to be very upset
 
02:03:56.450 --> 02:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
so we'll make it possible for consumers
 
02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
to control their own data
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
my thought is that if it's my data and I
 
02:04:02.689 --> 02:04:02.699 align:start position:0%
give it to the company I give it to them
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
for a particular purpose and for that
 
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
purpose only and if they want to use it
 
02:04:07.850 --> 02:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
for some other purpose
 
02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
then they need to ask me
 
02:04:13.370 --> 02:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
so I would do a 180 on this bill
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
not that the companies would like that
 
02:04:16.970 --> 02:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
of course because there's money to be
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
made from data which is what this bill
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
in fact can I can I just interrupt and
 
02:04:29.089 --> 02:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
just ask one question sure Mr Kirk isn't
 
02:04:29.099 --> 02:04:29.990 align:start position:0%
just ask one question sure Mr Kirk isn't
there

02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:04:32.689 --> 02:04:32.699 align:start position:0%
isn't there a First Amendment concern
 
02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
about the
 
02:04:37.729 --> 02:04:37.739 align:start position:0%
uh about what you propose that in other
 
02:04:40.729 --> 02:04:40.739 align:start position:0%
words if when you say it's when you say
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's my data I mean let's just let's
 
02:04:46.430 --> 02:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
just take a very simple example if I
 
02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:49.679 align:start position:0%
tell you if I if I tell you a secret and
 
02:04:53.089 --> 02:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
I say please don't tell that to anyone
 
02:04:57.709 --> 02:04:57.719 align:start position:0%
do I do can I restrict you and you say
 
02:04:59.870 --> 02:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
yes I won't tell anyone can I restrict
 
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
you from telling someone or is that or
 
02:05:03.530 --> 02:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
would that be a First Amendment
 
02:05:06.649 --> 02:05:06.659 align:start position:0%
violation for it for for the law to say
 
02:05:09.530 --> 02:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
you can't now tell anyone
 
02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:11.629 align:start position:0%
you can't now tell anyone
um

02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:13.609 --> 02:05:13.619 align:start position:0%
I don't think it would be because if it
 
02:05:15.169 --> 02:05:15.179 align:start position:0%
would be then this bill would also be a
 
02:05:16.729 --> 02:05:16.739 align:start position:0%
first violation a First Amendment
 
02:05:18.609 --> 02:05:18.619 align:start position:0%
violation because it's in effect
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
interfering with the communication of
 
02:05:23.930 --> 02:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
data the state is saying this is allowed
 
02:05:25.729 --> 02:05:25.739 align:start position:0%
and this is not allowed
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh I I think that we're not I I don't
 
02:05:30.410 --> 02:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
think it's a First Amendment issue
 
02:05:32.089 --> 02:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
because we're not saying what you can
 
02:05:33.649 --> 02:05:33.659 align:start position:0%
and can say we're only saying what you
 
02:05:35.629 --> 02:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
can do with this data
 
02:05:37.550 --> 02:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
um we're saying and we have this as a
 
02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:40.679 align:start position:0%
state policy in other areas that um for
 
02:05:43.250 --> 02:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
example your medical record according to
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
state law
 
02:05:46.430 --> 02:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
is your property
 
02:05:47.689 --> 02:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
it's not the property of Dartmouth
 
02:05:52.010 --> 02:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock or Dr Jones it's your property
 
02:05:53.570 --> 02:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
um and that's information and we're
 
02:05:55.550 --> 02:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
saying this and my proposal is to use
 
02:05:57.290 --> 02:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
that same concept here I don't see the
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
First Amendment issue
 
02:06:00.890 --> 02:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
but Mr chairman I defer to your
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
expertise in this area
 
02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
um if I may proceed please yes thank you
 
02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:08.270 align:start position:0%
um if I may proceed please yes thank you
um

02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
because the bill has it backward I think
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
the title is somewhat misleading it's
 
02:06:14.930 --> 02:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
not really an expectation of privacy
 
02:06:18.050 --> 02:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
it's the protection of information in
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
the hands of businesses
 
02:06:22.010 --> 02:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
or just one aside because it occurred to
 
02:06:23.930 --> 02:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
me now Mr chairman you asked whether the
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand people uh is is New
 
02:06:29.450 --> 02:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or Nationwide if you look at
 
02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:31.679 align:start position:0%
the definition of consumer in this bill
 
02:06:34.010 --> 02:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
and that's the word that's used 100 000
 
02:06:36.169 --> 02:06:36.179 align:start position:0%
consumers a consumer has to be a
 
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire so that's one
 
02:06:39.649 --> 02:06:39.659 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand New Hampshire people
 
02:06:42.589 --> 02:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
roughly one out of every 13 people
 
02:06:45.410 --> 02:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
probably Amazon qualifies Microsoft
 
02:06:47.689 --> 02:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
qualifies but it's just going to be
 
02:06:49.490 --> 02:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
major national companies I would think
 
02:06:51.950 --> 02:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
that would qualify uh or would be
 
02:06:53.689 --> 02:06:53.699 align:start position:0%
subject to this bill everyone else would
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
not be subject to it so while they're
 
02:06:58.609 --> 02:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
very important in our lives they are
 
02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
certainly not the majority of companies
 
02:07:02.570 --> 02:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
either in this state or nationally who
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
would be subject to this bill
 
02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:09.350 align:start position:0%
would be subject to this bill
um

02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
I believe needs to fully understand this
 
02:07:15.950 --> 02:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
bill before it acts on it that's house
 
02:07:17.810 --> 02:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
practice that's the legislature's
 
02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:18.890 align:start position:0%
practice that's the legislature's
strength

02:07:18.890 --> 02:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
strength
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
the Senate doesn't always have the time
 
02:07:24.649 --> 02:07:24.659 align:start position:0%
or manpower to do it the house does I
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
hope that you will do it
 
02:07:28.370 --> 02:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
I personally doubt that a subcommittee
 
02:07:29.570 --> 02:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
could do this in the time available
 
02:07:31.550 --> 02:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
before this bill has to be out of
 
02:07:34.850 --> 02:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
committee so my suggestion is either you
 
02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
retain it to work on it or that you set
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
this up set up some sort of a study
 
02:07:41.450 --> 02:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
committee that will go into this whole
 
02:07:43.310 --> 02:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
subject and deal with the issue of
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
opt-in and opt out and whose data really
 
02:07:49.370 --> 02:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
is it when I provide information to a
 
02:07:50.930 --> 02:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
Company for purpose a and the company
 
02:07:52.729 --> 02:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
decides to use that information for
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
purpose B and either tells me
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
or doesn't tell me but if they don't if
 
02:08:00.530 --> 02:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
they do tell me I don't have a choice at
 
02:08:02.570 --> 02:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
the way things are now
 
02:08:04.490 --> 02:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
um I guess my concern with this bill is
 
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
that it violates my basic concept of
 
02:08:08.990 --> 02:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
personal information and that is it
 
02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
belongs to me and I should be able to
 
02:08:13.129 --> 02:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
control it and when I give it to
 
02:08:14.810 --> 02:08:14.820 align:start position:0%
somebody else I give it to them for a
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
specific purpose and for that purpose
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
only and for them to use it for some
 
02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
other purpose in effect denies me of my
 
02:08:23.390 --> 02:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
property right in my personal
 
02:08:25.550 --> 02:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
information and I'd like to get paid for
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
it among other things
 
02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
and with that very subtle uh conclusion
 
02:08:32.570 --> 02:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be pleased to answer any
 
02:08:35.629 --> 02:08:35.639 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this word
 
02:08:37.189 --> 02:08:37.199 align:start position:0%

02:15:58.970 --> 02:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
year until 2018 when it's Sunset that
 
02:16:00.709 --> 02:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee received
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
regular reports from the New Hampshire
 
02:16:04.609 --> 02:16:04.619 align:start position:0%
Department of Insurance
 
02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
and the judicial branch including data
 
02:16:09.250 --> 02:16:09.260 align:start position:0%
and findings we've studied the medical
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
malpractice screening panels for almost
 
02:16:13.069 --> 02:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
there is nothing we will learn in the
 
02:16:16.729 --> 02:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
next three years that we haven't learned
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
in the last 20 years studying this issue
 
02:16:23.330 --> 02:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
um the testimony we heard that the
 
02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
panels are simply not working and never
 
02:16:27.770 --> 02:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
have at the Senate hearing the committee
 
02:16:30.050 --> 02:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
heard extensive testimony that for
 
02:16:31.970 --> 02:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
almost two decades the medical screening
 
02:16:34.490 --> 02:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
panels had been in place the panels have
 
02:16:37.009 --> 02:16:37.019 align:start position:0%
not been widely used have not met any of
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
the promises made and have not reduced
 
02:16:42.410 --> 02:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
the number of medical malpractice cases
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
filed and have not decreased the costs
 
02:16:47.469 --> 02:16:47.479 align:start position:0%
for the involved parties
 
02:16:50.030 --> 02:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
most notably we heard about the vast
 
02:16:52.129 --> 02:16:52.139 align:start position:0%
resources that it costs our judicial
 
02:16:54.589 --> 02:16:54.599 align:start position:0%
branch to process these
 
02:16:54.599 --> 02:16:55.549 align:start position:0%
branch to process these
um

02:16:55.549 --> 02:16:55.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:57.950 --> 02:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
these cases the committee heard
 
02:16:59.929 --> 02:16:59.939 align:start position:0%
testimony about the extensive time and
 
02:17:01.969 --> 02:17:01.979 align:start position:0%
effort the judicial branch puts into
 
02:17:04.730 --> 02:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
assembling these panels only to have
 
02:17:07.070 --> 02:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
them waived at the last moment by both
 
02:17:10.250 --> 02:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
plaintiff and defense counsel the panels
 
02:17:11.929 --> 02:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
are simply not working and therefore the
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
Senate on a bipartisan basis unanimously
 
02:17:17.089 --> 02:17:17.099 align:start position:0%
agreed the time has come to repeal the
 
02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
panel system to reduce the cost time and
 
02:17:22.849 --> 02:17:22.859 align:start position:0%
effort to all parties involved in the
 
02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice cases I will also I
 
02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:27.230 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice cases I will also I
won't

02:17:27.230 --> 02:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
won't
 
02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:28.070 align:start position:0%
won't
um

02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:29.450 align:start position:0%
um
read

02:17:29.450 --> 02:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
read
 
02:17:33.410 --> 02:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
read I also attached with my testimony a
 
02:17:36.650 --> 02:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
letter from uh David Bettencourt from
 
02:17:38.990 --> 02:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Insurance Senator
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
Bradley in the testimony had asked him
 
02:17:44.750 --> 02:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
to kind of do a summary of all the cases
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
that they had and I gave you the the
 
02:17:50.690 --> 02:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
sheet the letter that he had drafted or
 
02:17:52.429 --> 02:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
the memo that he had drafted but in
 
02:17:55.129 --> 02:17:55.139 align:start position:0%
synopsis our analysis shows that the use
 
02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
of the screening panel process did not
 
02:17:59.810 --> 02:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
appear to have any measurable measurable
 
02:18:02.690 --> 02:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
effect on the outcome of the claims when
 
02:18:05.570 --> 02:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
it came to the length process and he
 
02:18:08.030 --> 02:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
goes into detail in bullet points on
 
02:18:11.509 --> 02:18:11.519 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the issues with it I
 
02:18:13.310 --> 02:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
will also just quickly go through some
 
02:18:15.889 --> 02:18:15.899 align:start position:0%
bullet points Richard head had testified
 
02:18:19.009 --> 02:18:19.019 align:start position:0%
in our committee he said that it was
 
02:18:20.990 --> 02:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
apparent to the judicial branch that the
 
02:18:22.910 --> 02:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
screening process had failed and is not
 
02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
a functioning process he also said that
 
02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:27.599 align:start position:0%
judicial branch initially proposed a
 
02:18:29.389 --> 02:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
full repeal of the medical malpractice
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
practice screening panel Stitch statute
 
02:18:33.650 --> 02:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
at a meeting with the New Hampshire
 
02:18:36.650 --> 02:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
Medical Society Hospital Association and
 
02:18:39.290 --> 02:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
the association for justice he also said
 
02:18:41.150 --> 02:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
the number of panels has considered
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
consistently been between zero and four
 
02:18:46.669 --> 02:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
for the last decade he said that he
 
02:18:48.889 --> 02:18:48.899 align:start position:0%
feels embarrassed for the staff who have
 
02:18:50.450 --> 02:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
to go through the effort of pulling
 
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
together a panel only for the panel to
 
02:18:56.570 --> 02:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
be waived at the last moment and what
 
02:18:59.089 --> 02:18:59.099 align:start position:0%
I'll finally say is Senator Bradley did
 
02:19:03.410 --> 02:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
ask summarize for Richard head it says
 
02:19:05.330 --> 02:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley summarized Mr head's
 
02:19:07.070 --> 02:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
testimony as if
 
02:19:10.250 --> 02:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
as if Mr head had his druthers the
 
02:19:12.169 --> 02:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice screening panels
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
would be repealed in their entirety and
 
02:19:17.330 --> 02:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
Mr head said that that was correct that
 
02:19:19.129 --> 02:19:19.139 align:start position:0%
that was what the judicial branch
 
02:19:21.469 --> 02:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
proposed in the first instance
 
02:19:24.110 --> 02:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
so with that thank you for the
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak and I will take any
 
02:19:27.650 --> 02:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
questions although I know you're running
 
02:19:29.089 --> 02:19:29.099 align:start position:0%
behind and there are plenty of people
 
02:19:31.129 --> 02:19:31.139 align:start position:0%
behind me that know the subject much
 
02:19:34.310 --> 02:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
better than I do thank you questions for
 
02:19:37.490 --> 02:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
yes Senator yes representative Horrigan
 
02:19:40.849 --> 02:19:40.859 align:start position:0%
thank you very much being um being
 
02:19:42.349 --> 02:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
waived and I noticed there's some
 
02:19:44.690 --> 02:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
numbers about it from about
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
a former representative pedicure
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
commission Deputy Commissioner
 
02:19:50.330 --> 02:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
bettencors are they waiving
 
02:19:52.190 --> 02:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
because they decided to go to the court
 
02:19:54.590 --> 02:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
instead are they waving because they've
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
settled um out of panel instead of out
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
of corridor because
 
02:20:01.790 --> 02:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
or because the plaintiff is abandoned
 
02:20:04.310 --> 02:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
the claim so like why are they
 
02:20:05.929 --> 02:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
what are the main reasons why they're
 
02:20:07.450 --> 02:20:07.460 align:start position:0%
being waived and
 
02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
well I think that's a better question
 
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
for the attorneys but I have a my
 
02:20:13.849 --> 02:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
suspicion is that there'd be a waived
 
02:20:17.929 --> 02:20:17.939 align:start position:0%
because they either came they have a
 
02:20:20.510 --> 02:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
resolution or they want to take it to
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
the courts or sometimes from my
 
02:20:26.750 --> 02:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
understanding some um the attorneys who
 
02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
are presenting the malpractice cases
 
02:20:32.450 --> 02:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
don't want to don't want to
 
02:20:34.730 --> 02:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
give any idea of how they're going to be
 
02:20:40.250 --> 02:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:42.530 --> 02:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
say none thank you very much Senator
 
02:20:45.889 --> 02:20:45.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:48.530 --> 02:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on Abigail Alby
 
02:21:02.030 --> 02:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
I guess it's good afternoon Mr chairman
 
02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:21:08.210 --> 02:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
Abigail Albee I'm here on behalf of the
 
02:21:09.889 --> 02:21:09.899 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
02:21:11.389 --> 02:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to tell you that we support
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
the repeal and ask if you have any
 
02:21:17.389 --> 02:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
questions that I can answer I'm I'm
 
02:21:19.250 --> 02:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
going to be very brief I'm just here to
 
02:21:20.510 --> 02:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you might have
 
02:21:23.330 --> 02:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
perhaps about how the panels are working
 
02:21:25.370 --> 02:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
or not working
 
02:21:27.530 --> 02:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
um and so I'll open it up to you guys if
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
you have questions about how the
 
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
superior court is functioning currently
 
02:21:32.330 --> 02:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
with these
 
02:21:34.969 --> 02:21:34.979 align:start position:0%
you know I wonder might what might be
 
02:21:36.650 --> 02:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
helpful could you could you just sort of
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
take us through what the
 
02:21:41.389 --> 02:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
what is entailed and say a new
 
02:21:44.090 --> 02:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
malpractice claim is filed sure what can
 
02:21:45.650 --> 02:21:45.660 align:start position:0%
you take us through the process sure so
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
when a new um malpractice panel or new
 
02:21:51.230 --> 02:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
malpractice case is filed there's sort
 
02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
of two routes that it's simultaneously
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
on the first route is the panel route
 
02:21:59.450 --> 02:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
which means that
 
02:22:01.790 --> 02:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
um it goes to an office that's
 
02:22:04.610 --> 02:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
supervised by the Chief Justice of the
 
02:22:06.469 --> 02:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Superior Court tiananetto
 
02:22:10.730 --> 02:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
and that office opens up a case
 
02:22:13.730 --> 02:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
um that case is then a panel is put
 
02:22:16.130 --> 02:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
together the panel consists of a
 
02:22:18.110 --> 02:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
chairperson who's normally a retired
 
02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
judge an attorney
 
02:22:23.389 --> 02:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
usually someone from the Healthcare
 
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
Community a doctor an expert in the
 
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
field in which the medical malpractice
 
02:22:30.170 --> 02:22:30.180 align:start position:0%
claim is brought
 
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
um so that is one piece that is going on
 
02:22:35.450 --> 02:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
on the other channel that is happening
 
02:22:38.030 --> 02:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
the case is usually is being filed in
 
02:22:40.250 --> 02:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court the case is still
 
02:22:42.590 --> 02:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
headed down the trial track and so we're
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
putting resources towards a trial
 
02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
setting up structuring conferences
 
02:22:48.670 --> 02:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
setting up
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
final pre-trials setting up jury
 
02:22:52.610 --> 02:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
selection all the things that would
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
normally happen while the panel process
 
02:22:59.469 --> 02:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
is also going on so I'm not sure if I
 
02:23:01.550 --> 02:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
that completely answers your question
 
02:23:03.290 --> 02:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
but there's sort of these two tracks
 
02:23:04.730 --> 02:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
that they're both on at the same time
 
02:23:06.830 --> 02:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
and what we're what we've seen over the
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
course of this almost 20 years as the
 
02:23:12.530 --> 02:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
senator was just testifying to is that
 
02:23:12.540 --> 02:23:13.910 align:start position:0%
senator was just testifying to is that
the

02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:23:18.290 --> 02:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
panels are being mostly waived by but
 
02:23:21.410 --> 02:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
both sides of the litigation
 
02:23:23.690 --> 02:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
so what happens is we have this as I
 
02:23:25.730 --> 02:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
said the first track where everybody is
 
02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
getting ready for the panel as well as
 
02:23:28.670 --> 02:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
getting ready for trial and so the
 
02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
lawyers on both sides both for the you
 
02:23:34.010 --> 02:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
know for the doctors and for
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
um the plaintiffs are being put in a
 
02:23:37.610 --> 02:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
position where they're preparing for two
 
02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
set tracks of litigation essentially a
 
02:23:41.809 --> 02:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
litigation track that involves the panel
 
02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
to discuss if they can be resolved and
 
02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
then also
 
02:23:50.710 --> 02:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:53.510 --> 02:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
can you just tell us a little bit about
 
02:23:57.230 --> 02:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
what is there in your experience or in
 
02:23:59.270 --> 02:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
the Court's experience is has there been
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
difficulty in trying to get both doctors
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
and lawyers to serve on the panels yes
 
02:24:10.250 --> 02:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
um yeah the short answer is yes
 
02:24:14.389 --> 02:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
um I I would say that you know it's a
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
Time con consumption for both sides
 
02:24:18.650 --> 02:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
right for lawyers to volunteer to be on
 
02:24:20.510 --> 02:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
these panels and for
 
02:24:23.090 --> 02:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
um the medical community to also be on
 
02:24:25.309 --> 02:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
the panels it is a big time draw for
 
02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
them they have to review a lot of
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
documents they have to be prepared for
 
02:24:30.889 --> 02:24:30.899 align:start position:0%
the panel hearings and so it has
 
02:24:33.050 --> 02:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
traditionally been very difficult for us
 
02:24:35.210 --> 02:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
I think in the beginning we had a lot of
 
02:24:37.130 --> 02:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
not a lot but we had a number of panel
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
hearings and we it was I think
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
working the way it was intended to work
 
02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
but over the years that has completely
 
02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:46.370 align:start position:0%
but over the years that has completely
dwindled

02:24:46.370 --> 02:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
dwindled
 
02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
um so much so that we've had a very hard
 
02:24:49.490 --> 02:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
time to get people to sit on the panels
 
02:24:51.530 --> 02:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
and also even you know most of the
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
panels have just disappeared I believe
 
02:24:55.250 --> 02:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
um assume but I believe that no I don't
 
02:24:59.150 --> 02:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
know if this was what Richard submitted
 
02:25:02.330 --> 02:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
Richard had to the um Senate when he
 
02:25:04.670 --> 02:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
testified or if you have a copy of the
 
02:25:06.889 --> 02:25:06.899 align:start position:0%
the numbers but there are we have all
 
02:25:09.170 --> 02:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
the numbers of the day with the data the
 
02:25:12.889 --> 02:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
dates back from 2005 to today
 
02:25:14.690 --> 02:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to provide that to you
 
02:25:16.610 --> 02:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
if you don't have it but we I believe it
 
02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
was provided yeah well you know what
 
02:25:22.910 --> 02:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
actually yes yes saying to me I have not
 
02:25:24.770 --> 02:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
I will circulate it I have not done that
 
02:25:26.570 --> 02:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
yet and I should have but um I will
 
02:25:27.950 --> 02:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
circulate it to the other members of the
 
02:25:29.809 --> 02:25:29.819 align:start position:0%
committee okay so I can say that
 
02:25:32.809 --> 02:25:32.819 align:start position:0%
essentially since 2017
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:41.990 --> 02:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative Tripp
 
02:25:44.150 --> 02:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:25:46.969 --> 02:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
excuse me could you you said that the
 
02:25:49.550 --> 02:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
panels have been waived what does that
 
02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:50.750 align:start position:0%
panels have been waived what does that
mean

02:25:50.750 --> 02:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:25:53.630 --> 02:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
so under the the current
 
02:25:57.230 --> 02:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
um statute any party can waive the panel
 
02:25:58.849 --> 02:25:58.859 align:start position:0%
or both parties can waive the panel
 
02:26:00.830 --> 02:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
which means that they can say you know
 
02:26:02.630 --> 02:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
what this is not a good use of our
 
02:26:04.969 --> 02:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
resources not a good use of our time or
 
02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
strategic for strategic reasons they may
 
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
say they don't want to have the panel
 
02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:10.190 align:start position:0%
say they don't want to have the panel
because

02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:26:12.349 --> 02:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
um you'll see that in the statute it
 
02:26:14.270 --> 02:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
allows for
 
02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:15.590 align:start position:0%
allows for
um

02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:18.650 --> 02:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
the findings the panel findings to be
 
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
submitted to the jury if you go to a
 
02:26:22.969 --> 02:26:22.979 align:start position:0%
jury trial the findings are submitted to
 
02:26:27.230 --> 02:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
the jury so lawyers May opt to say this
 
02:26:29.330 --> 02:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
is not a good strategic decision for my
 
02:26:31.490 --> 02:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
case to go to a panel Hearing in which
 
02:26:33.230 --> 02:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
case they would say I'm gonna we're
 
02:26:35.110 --> 02:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
gonna wave it we're gonna go straight to
 
02:26:38.270 --> 02:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
the jury or go straight to the court to
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
resolve the issue
 
02:26:41.510 --> 02:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
other questions for this one is yes
 
02:26:43.070 --> 02:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
chair how much do you
 
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm right here
 
02:26:48.110 --> 02:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
how much do you believe the judicial
 
02:26:49.550 --> 02:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
branch will save with the repeal of
 
02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:50.770 align:start position:0%
branch will save with the repeal of
these

02:26:50.770 --> 02:26:50.780 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:26:54.770 --> 02:26:54.780 align:start position:0%
we have at least one position that is
 
02:26:57.889 --> 02:26:57.899 align:start position:0%
completely dedicated to this I will
 
02:27:00.530 --> 02:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
that's my limited knowledge to how much
 
02:27:02.090 --> 02:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
money that would cost in the sense that
 
02:27:03.530 --> 02:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
I don't I can't give you a dollar figure
 
02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to get you that information
 
02:27:07.130 --> 02:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
but I don't know that off the top of my
 
02:27:08.690 --> 02:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
head other than to say to you that I
 
02:27:11.450 --> 02:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
know for from my current role that
 
02:27:13.010 --> 02:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
there's one position that definitely
 
02:27:15.650 --> 02:27:15.660 align:start position:0%
deals exclusively with this
 
02:27:18.410 --> 02:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
um so sorry not a great answer other
 
02:27:20.590 --> 02:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
question representative Perez
 
02:27:24.830 --> 02:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
so the committee was not the only way to
 
02:27:27.110 --> 02:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
settle something without going to trial
 
02:27:31.690 --> 02:27:31.700 align:start position:0%
correct correct so I'd be curious since
 
02:27:35.990 --> 02:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
2017 how many or what percentage of
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
cases were settled going that route
 
02:27:43.910 --> 02:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
without going to trial
 
02:27:45.770 --> 02:27:45.780 align:start position:0%
meaning going to I'm sorry just
 
02:27:47.870 --> 02:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
demeaning going to the panel as a
 
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
settlement or going a different route
 
02:27:51.770 --> 02:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
for something following the court route
 
02:27:54.170 --> 02:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
the traditional traditional
 
02:27:56.510 --> 02:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
and we're settled before they actually
 
02:27:58.849 --> 02:27:58.859 align:start position:0%
went to a you don't have to tell me
 
02:28:00.290 --> 02:28:00.300 align:start position:0%
right now I just would be curious
 
02:28:04.190 --> 02:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
actually we're settled without having to
 
02:28:07.250 --> 02:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
go before a jury okay is that clear it
 
02:28:09.469 --> 02:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
is and thank you I can I can tell you
 
02:28:12.349 --> 02:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
that my rough math which is exactly that
 
02:28:14.030 --> 02:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
rough math because it's not my strong
 
02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:15.170 align:start position:0%
rough math because it's not my strong
suit

02:28:15.170 --> 02:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
suit
 
02:28:15.180 --> 02:28:17.870 align:start position:0%
suit
um is

02:28:17.870 --> 02:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:20.929 --> 02:28:20.939 align:start position:0%
about 60 cases settled by a voluntary
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
non-seater docket markings before a
 
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
panel hearing and then the TR and beyond
 
02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
that there were
 
02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:29.510 align:start position:0%
that there were
um

02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:32.090 --> 02:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
you know 50 or so that were dismissed
 
02:28:32.100 --> 02:28:33.469 align:start position:0%
you know 50 or so that were dismissed
withdrawn

02:28:33.469 --> 02:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
withdrawn
 
02:28:37.130 --> 02:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
um summary judgment mistrial so that's
 
02:28:39.530 --> 02:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
all before juries before a jury is
 
02:28:41.929 --> 02:28:41.939 align:start position:0%
impaneled yes
 
02:28:44.990 --> 02:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
and I I just need a perspective out of
 
02:28:46.370 --> 02:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
how many
 
02:28:52.849 --> 02:28:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:52.859 --> 02:28:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
350.

02:28:57.410 --> 02:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:01.130 --> 02:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
2017 to 2020.
 
02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
so 2017 to 2020 there were how many 350
 
02:29:08.270 --> 02:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
would so there were okay I I'm sorry so
 
02:29:14.690 --> 02:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:18.590 --> 02:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
yeah 275 cases roughly in that time
 
02:29:20.389 --> 02:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
period that were filed with the court
 
02:29:23.090 --> 02:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
for medical malpractice across the state
 
02:29:31.849 --> 02:29:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:31.859 --> 02:29:34.250 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

02:29:34.250 --> 02:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:29:37.429 --> 02:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
um that there were about 105 where the
 
02:29:40.190 --> 02:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
panels were waived and then of those and
 
02:29:43.010 --> 02:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
then beyond that there were
 
02:29:43.020 --> 02:29:45.230 align:start position:0%
then beyond that there were
um

02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:47.870 --> 02:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
55 of them which were non-suited or
 
02:29:50.450 --> 02:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
settled before the panel hearing took
 
02:29:56.510 --> 02:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:59.450 --> 02:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
60 or so that were settled in a
 
02:30:01.610 --> 02:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
different way either through a motion
 
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
for summary judgment that was ruled on a
 
02:30:07.010 --> 02:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
mistra mistrial or the case was
 
02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawn or there was some other reason
 
02:30:11.450 --> 02:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
that prop wasn't proper service or
 
02:30:13.790 --> 02:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
something like that so all of that is
 
02:30:16.370 --> 02:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
prior to the jury being in panel so the
 
02:30:19.010 --> 02:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
vast majority thank you other questions
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
um thanks for taking the question so I
 
02:30:31.550 --> 02:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
guess my one thought is it seems like
 
02:30:35.150 --> 02:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps the the underlying problem here
 
02:30:37.730 --> 02:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
from what I'm understanding every case
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
that comes
 
02:30:42.530 --> 02:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
triggers this process to start creating
 
02:30:44.750 --> 02:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
this panel
 
02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether the people
 
02:30:49.070 --> 02:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
involved may know right from the get-go
 
02:30:51.530 --> 02:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
that they are not going to want it
 
02:30:53.809 --> 02:30:53.819 align:start position:0%
um that's correct Okay so
 
02:30:57.410 --> 02:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
I given the fact that the mechanisms for
 
02:31:01.210 --> 02:31:01.220 align:start position:0%
doing these are sort of already in place
 
02:31:03.770 --> 02:31:03.780 align:start position:0%
would it sort of
 
02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
change the dynamic would there be any
 
02:31:08.270 --> 02:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
value in your mind of sort of preserving
 
02:31:10.429 --> 02:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
the ability for someone to go this route
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
like again we spent the morning talking
 
02:31:15.770 --> 02:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
about opt-in versus opt out to opt into
 
02:31:18.050 --> 02:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
this process rather than sort of having
 
02:31:20.750 --> 02:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
the whole thing get going and then opt
 
02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:22.670 align:start position:0%
the whole thing get going and then opt
out

02:31:22.670 --> 02:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:31:25.370 --> 02:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I have a great answer to
 
02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
that I don't think that the statute as
 
02:31:29.690 --> 02:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
it currently is written
 
02:31:33.410 --> 02:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
is a statute that would allow that to
 
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
happen obviously but I'm not sure that
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
you could amend the statute without a
 
02:31:39.349 --> 02:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
full repeal and then a rewrite because
 
02:31:43.250 --> 02:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
our system right now is not working
 
02:31:44.929 --> 02:31:44.939 align:start position:0%
um and I think that you'll hear from a
 
02:31:46.550 --> 02:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
number of other people that it's
 
02:31:48.530 --> 02:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
currently not a system that's working so
 
02:31:49.849 --> 02:31:49.859 align:start position:0%
I hear what you're saying you know would
 
02:31:51.410 --> 02:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
it make sense to opt in but I think that
 
02:31:53.570 --> 02:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
that's something would take maybe a
 
02:31:55.490 --> 02:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to study how that process
 
02:31:57.110 --> 02:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
would work
 
02:31:59.570 --> 02:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
um and whether or not it makes sense to
 
02:32:01.969 --> 02:32:01.979 align:start position:0%
put this the number of resources that we
 
02:32:03.530 --> 02:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
currently are using and the money that
 
02:32:05.809 --> 02:32:05.819 align:start position:0%
we're using to do this for an opt-in
 
02:32:08.030 --> 02:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
which is above my pay grade and
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
definitely in yours so thank you
 
02:32:13.370 --> 02:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
other other questions representative
 
02:32:13.380 --> 02:32:14.750 align:start position:0%
other other questions representative
Manos

02:32:14.750 --> 02:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
Manos
 
02:32:16.730 --> 02:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:32:18.110 --> 02:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:32:22.730 --> 02:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
was the purpose of the panels to act as
 
02:32:27.710 --> 02:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:31.910 --> 02:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
I think initially that that was part of
 
02:32:33.830 --> 02:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
the intention I know there's a there's a
 
02:32:35.389 --> 02:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
gentleman here today that will testify
 
02:32:37.610 --> 02:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
that was involved in the original
 
02:32:39.650 --> 02:32:39.660 align:start position:0%
um drafting in the statute I think
 
02:32:41.929 --> 02:32:41.939 align:start position:0%
originally that there was some hope that
 
02:32:44.929 --> 02:32:44.939 align:start position:0%
that is what this what um what the
 
02:32:47.389 --> 02:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
panels would do
 
02:32:50.750 --> 02:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
that being said I can speak
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
to my experience which has been that
 
02:32:56.630 --> 02:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
even though we have this panel process a
 
02:32:58.910 --> 02:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
number of Judges if not every Superior
 
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
Court Judge is also requiring the
 
02:33:03.410 --> 02:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
litigants to go through alternative
 
02:33:06.290 --> 02:33:06.300 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution on top of the panel
 
02:33:06.300 --> 02:33:07.370 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution on top of the panel
so

02:33:07.370 --> 02:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:33:09.290 --> 02:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
if that was the intent it is not how
 
02:33:11.630 --> 02:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's being being used
 
02:33:13.550 --> 02:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
02:33:15.050 --> 02:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:33:15.060 --> 02:33:15.770 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
um

02:33:15.770 --> 02:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
my first question is what is the
 
02:33:20.030 --> 02:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
compensation for the members of these
 
02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:21.290 align:start position:0%
compensation for the members of these
panels

02:33:21.290 --> 02:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
panels
 
02:33:24.050 --> 02:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
so the my understanding is that I I
 
02:33:25.730 --> 02:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
don't know what a dollar amount and I'm
 
02:33:27.230 --> 02:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
happy to provide you with that I can get
 
02:33:28.490 --> 02:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
that for you
 
02:33:30.889 --> 02:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
um I believe that the person who the the
 
02:33:33.590 --> 02:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
only member who is compensated and I may
 
02:33:35.330 --> 02:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
be incorrect and somebody behind me will
 
02:33:37.690 --> 02:33:37.700 align:start position:0%
probably correct me on this is the
 
02:33:40.370 --> 02:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
retired judge or
 
02:33:43.309 --> 02:33:43.319 align:start position:0%
um chairperson on the
 
02:33:45.410 --> 02:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
um that's on the panel
 
02:33:47.870 --> 02:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you and a follow-up if
 
02:33:49.490 --> 02:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
the panel makes the decision that
 
02:33:51.410 --> 02:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
displeases some of the litigants are
 
02:33:52.490 --> 02:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
they ever
 
02:33:55.550 --> 02:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
threatened with uh being sued or
 
02:33:59.750 --> 02:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
whatever by the uh unhappy litigants I
 
02:34:01.309 --> 02:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
think there's a provision in the statute
 
02:34:03.050 --> 02:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
that says you can't do that right good
 
02:34:05.590 --> 02:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
that's I'm glad to hear that
 
02:34:08.270 --> 02:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:34:11.870 --> 02:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay thank you
 
02:34:13.309 --> 02:34:13.319 align:start position:0%
good mention I'm sorry if I could just
 
02:34:15.950 --> 02:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
really briefly open the record again
 
02:34:17.750 --> 02:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
um that there I believe that there's an
 
02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that is going to be offered up
 
02:34:21.650 --> 02:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
by the hospital Association and although
 
02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
we support a full repeal of the bill the
 
02:34:26.270 --> 02:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
superior court is also in agreement with
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
the amendment um as drafted if that is
 
02:34:32.690 --> 02:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
all right thank you next I'm going to
 
02:34:35.570 --> 02:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
call on all uh
 
02:34:39.710 --> 02:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:42.650 --> 02:34:42.660 align:start position:0%
man okay that yes from the hospital
 
02:35:08.450 --> 02:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:11.389 --> 02:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
02:35:12.770 --> 02:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record Paula
 
02:35:14.570 --> 02:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
minihan Senior vice president state
 
02:35:15.770 --> 02:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
government relations for the New
 
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association
 
02:35:19.190 --> 02:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
representing all our hospitals in the
 
02:35:21.770 --> 02:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
state um we are opposed to Senate Bill
 
02:35:25.130 --> 02:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
65 as amended by the Senate um we were
 
02:35:27.469 --> 02:35:27.479 align:start position:0%
in favor of the original bill
 
02:35:29.389 --> 02:35:29.399 align:start position:0%
um that was introduced but we cannot
 
02:35:32.750 --> 02:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
support 65 which repeals the medical
 
02:35:35.450 --> 02:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
panel's outright the current medical
 
02:35:37.969 --> 02:35:37.979 align:start position:0%
panel screening panel statute has been
 
02:35:41.270 --> 02:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
in place as stated since 2005. we agree
 
02:35:45.110 --> 02:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
it is time to review the system which
 
02:35:47.330 --> 02:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
was created to address the costs of the
 
02:35:50.090 --> 02:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
medical injury reparation system and to
 
02:35:51.950 --> 02:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
promote availability and affordability
 
02:35:54.650 --> 02:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
of insurance against liability for
 
02:35:56.450 --> 02:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
medical injury and I should have put
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
that in quotes because that's comes from
 
02:36:01.730 --> 02:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
the original intent prompt appropriate
 
02:36:03.530 --> 02:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
resolution of medical claims in this
 
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
manner that are cost effective for all
 
02:36:08.389 --> 02:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
parties including the courts is the goal
 
02:36:11.690 --> 02:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
concerns were were have Arisen in the
 
02:36:13.610 --> 02:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
past year and I think there's been
 
02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
reference that we had a meeting
 
02:36:17.450 --> 02:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
um with the with the judicial branch
 
02:36:20.929 --> 02:36:20.939 align:start position:0%
with Mr Richard head we agreed it was
 
02:36:23.690 --> 02:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
time to review the current system and um
 
02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
we had a I would say a gentleman's
 
02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
agreement that um that resulted in
 
02:36:31.550 --> 02:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 65 but that did get changed
 
02:36:34.670 --> 02:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
um and so here we are with a bill that
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
completely repeals it which we do not
 
02:36:39.650 --> 02:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
support that is um we believe not
 
02:36:42.530 --> 02:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate um we don't we believe that
 
02:36:45.530 --> 02:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
there's time that is needed and that is
 
02:36:48.590 --> 02:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
what we are asking for consideration and
 
02:36:50.990 --> 02:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
um so that we can have a thoughtful
 
02:36:53.150 --> 02:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
discussion with all stakeholders we
 
02:36:54.950 --> 02:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
don't need a study committee so if we
 
02:36:58.370 --> 02:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
pause the current panel and repeat delay
 
02:37:01.309 --> 02:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
the repeal that is something that we
 
02:37:03.710 --> 02:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
would support because this is too
 
02:37:06.050 --> 02:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
important um this is um once you appeal
 
02:37:07.849 --> 02:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
and and some of you that have been here
 
02:37:10.730 --> 02:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
for a long time now once you repeal a
 
02:37:13.070 --> 02:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
statute it's very hard to put that back
 
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
on the books um so we are just asking
 
02:37:17.330 --> 02:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
for that consideration
 
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
um it does not add any more work for
 
02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
anyone um if we just pause it and delay
 
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
the repeal
 
02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
um and gives us some time to meet with
 
02:37:29.210 --> 02:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and look at other options I
 
02:37:31.610 --> 02:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
my understanding I was not um in this
 
02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
position I was at the association not in
 
02:37:35.690 --> 02:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
this position back in 2005 but I
 
02:37:38.330 --> 02:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
understand that the bill and I'm looking
 
02:37:39.950 --> 02:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
at representative Smith and
 
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn because I know you
 
02:37:44.330 --> 02:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
were more involved in different roles
 
02:37:44.340 --> 02:37:45.530 align:start position:0%
were more involved in different roles
but

02:37:45.530 --> 02:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:37:47.150 --> 02:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
um this was a compromise my
 
02:37:50.030 --> 02:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is that what passed there
 
02:37:53.150 --> 02:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
are other systems in place Maine is one
 
02:37:55.670 --> 02:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
system that does a panel before you go
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
to court so as the judicial branch
 
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative indicated we're in the we
 
02:38:03.469 --> 02:38:03.479 align:start position:0%
have dual tracks now and that is
 
02:38:06.530 --> 02:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
probably not the best system I am
 
02:38:09.170 --> 02:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
obviously not a lawyer and by but I know
 
02:38:11.210 --> 02:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
that I have talked with defense
 
02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
attorneys and I believe
 
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
there are some here today and there are
 
02:38:15.950 --> 02:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
others that couldn't be here because
 
02:38:18.290 --> 02:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
they're in court but we'll be submitting
 
02:38:20.809 --> 02:38:20.819 align:start position:0%
testimony they they have worked in other
 
02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
states there are ways to do this in a
 
02:38:26.030 --> 02:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
way that again we're just asking for
 
02:38:29.270 --> 02:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
some time to have a thoughtful
 
02:38:32.090 --> 02:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
discussion with all stakeholders and
 
02:38:34.429 --> 02:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
bring forth potentially something and if
 
02:38:37.130 --> 02:38:37.140 align:start position:0%
if if we don't have a sponsor
 
02:38:38.990 --> 02:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
um then it will not move forward and the
 
02:38:41.990 --> 02:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
repeal will happen so I I that I am
 
02:38:43.730 --> 02:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
respectfully asking for that um
 
02:38:45.950 --> 02:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
consideration I don't have um I know it
 
02:38:47.450 --> 02:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
was stated the hospital Association has
 
02:38:50.809 --> 02:38:50.819 align:start position:0%
a a an amendment I don't um but I have
 
02:38:52.610 --> 02:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
been working very closely with the
 
02:38:54.410 --> 02:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
medical society and I know that they
 
02:38:56.690 --> 02:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
have been working with some of some
 
02:38:59.330 --> 02:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
members um to for a consideration of an
 
02:39:01.790 --> 02:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
amendment and we do support that um I
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
don't know that I can answer any
 
02:39:05.270 --> 02:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
questions but I'll be happy to try
 
02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:09.590 align:start position:0%
questions but I'll be happy to try
representative

02:39:09.590 --> 02:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:12.170 --> 02:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
so it's my understanding that there was
 
02:39:12.180 --> 02:39:14.990 align:start position:0%
so it's my understanding that there was
a

02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:39:17.090 --> 02:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
Committee in place in order to study
 
02:39:20.570 --> 02:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
this until 2018
 
02:39:22.670 --> 02:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
um and it seems like
 
02:39:24.770 --> 02:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
it had stopped working before that
 
02:39:26.630 --> 02:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
because if you look there was only one
 
02:39:30.590 --> 02:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
case that went before the panel in 2017.
 
02:39:32.690 --> 02:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm just wondering what do
 
02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
you think that we're going to gain out
 
02:39:35.330 --> 02:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
of this that that other committee that
 
02:39:36.889 --> 02:39:36.899 align:start position:0%
was in place for
 
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
almost 20 years couldn't figure out what
 
02:39:40.250 --> 02:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
was wrong with it what do you think that
 
02:39:42.309 --> 02:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to capture and
 
02:39:45.170 --> 02:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
what would be your expectation there
 
02:39:47.570 --> 02:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't know of this other
 
02:39:50.030 --> 02:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
study committee that you speak of um so
 
02:39:53.210 --> 02:39:53.220 align:start position:0%
I was not part involved in that
 
02:39:55.550 --> 02:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not I'm not sure and maybe
 
02:39:57.950 --> 02:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
someone else can discuss that
 
02:39:57.960 --> 02:39:58.550 align:start position:0%
someone else can discuss that
um

02:39:58.550 --> 02:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:00.349 --> 02:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
I know that there's a lot of discussion
 
02:40:02.210 --> 02:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
about the insurance department and and
 
02:40:06.170 --> 02:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
other data um but it's really looking at
 
02:40:08.750 --> 02:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
the underlying statute that we need we
 
02:40:11.690 --> 02:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
now need to consider so
 
02:40:13.730 --> 02:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
um I don't I think the judicial branch
 
02:40:15.530 --> 02:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
was indicating you don't just tweak
 
02:40:18.170 --> 02:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
necessarily tweak the current um
 
02:40:21.469 --> 02:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
um statute I think again it it just
 
02:40:23.809 --> 02:40:23.819 align:start position:0%
deserves some attention
 
02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and we were made aware of this intent
 
02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
to file this bill by by the judicial
 
02:40:32.450 --> 02:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
branch by Richard head last summer and
 
02:40:34.670 --> 02:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
that's when we said please before you do
 
02:40:36.590 --> 02:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
that can we have can we have a
 
02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
discussion about this because again it
 
02:40:42.349 --> 02:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
um there are two sides to this and um if
 
02:40:44.990 --> 02:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
we're if we're our goal is to be more
 
02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
efficient for all parties including the
 
02:40:50.270 --> 02:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
three parties I guess um when you
 
02:40:53.030 --> 02:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
consider the judicial branch it we
 
02:40:54.950 --> 02:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
haven't had that time to do that um
 
02:40:57.469 --> 02:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
that's that's all I I'm just I'm sorry I
 
02:40:59.150 --> 02:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
don't know what study committee you're
 
02:41:00.290 --> 02:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
02:41:02.990 --> 02:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
yeah follow-up
 
02:41:05.929 --> 02:41:05.939 align:start position:0%
so I guess so you you did know about it
 
02:41:08.510 --> 02:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
since last summer were you able to have
 
02:41:10.610 --> 02:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
any understanding of what may be the the
 
02:41:12.530 --> 02:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
possible cause or the problem with the
 
02:41:14.690 --> 02:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
committee and I guess a secondary
 
02:41:17.270 --> 02:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
question would also be when this panel
 
02:41:20.510 --> 02:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
was working how much was it saving was
 
02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
were there less cases that you feel were
 
02:41:26.090 --> 02:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
ending up being filed and
 
02:41:28.670 --> 02:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
was it resulting in
 
02:41:32.210 --> 02:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
less payments for it I I am not able to
 
02:41:33.889 --> 02:41:33.899 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
02:41:37.309 --> 02:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
um and as far as when we were made aware
 
02:41:39.770 --> 02:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
that's when we we asked for a study
 
02:41:41.750 --> 02:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
committee because the initial
 
02:41:44.270 --> 02:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
proposal was to just put in a repeal
 
02:41:46.730 --> 02:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
bill and we asked for a study committee
 
02:41:48.969 --> 02:41:48.979 align:start position:0%
so that we could look at other options
 
02:41:52.550 --> 02:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
again there are other options across the
 
02:41:56.750 --> 02:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
the country and we we just do not
 
02:41:59.630 --> 02:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
believe outright repeal is the answer at
 
02:42:00.770 --> 02:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
this time
 
02:42:02.410 --> 02:42:02.420 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
02:42:04.670 --> 02:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:42:07.550 --> 02:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
said this is too important
 
02:42:10.849 --> 02:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
uh to have a repeal
 
02:42:13.969 --> 02:42:13.979 align:start position:0%
and yet the numbers that have been
 
02:42:16.450 --> 02:42:16.460 align:start position:0%
presented to us
 
02:42:19.690 --> 02:42:19.700 align:start position:0%
would not indicate
 
02:42:19.700 --> 02:42:21.650 align:start position:0%
would not indicate
that

02:42:21.650 --> 02:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:42:25.730 --> 02:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
this process was considered important by
 
02:42:29.809 --> 02:42:29.819 align:start position:0%
any of the sides involved because the
 
02:42:32.270 --> 02:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
numbers are so low
 
02:42:37.070 --> 02:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
and again I will defer to experts behind
 
02:42:39.770 --> 02:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
me but because I'm not involved in these
 
02:42:42.530 --> 02:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
but it's because they the Dual tracks
 
02:42:44.570 --> 02:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
and it is determined at a certain point
 
02:42:47.570 --> 02:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
that it makes more sense to just settle
 
02:42:49.790 --> 02:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
um because again I think the Dual track
 
02:42:52.130 --> 02:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
makes it very unique
 
02:42:54.050 --> 02:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
um because there you're spending a lot
 
02:42:56.929 --> 02:42:56.939 align:start position:0%
of time doing both so they I and again I
 
02:42:59.349 --> 02:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
I will stop there and ask
 
02:43:01.969 --> 02:43:01.979 align:start position:0%
experts behind me to to address that
 
02:43:04.010 --> 02:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you it's a very it's a
 
02:43:05.929 --> 02:43:05.939 align:start position:0%
fair very fair question and I don't
 
02:43:08.870 --> 02:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
think anyone wants to put you on on the
 
02:43:11.809 --> 02:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
spot so it might just be that you you
 
02:43:14.450 --> 02:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
know you move aside and let other people
 
02:43:18.349 --> 02:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
deal with it that's fair representative
 
02:43:18.359 --> 02:43:20.450 align:start position:0%
deal with it that's fair representative
representative

02:43:20.450 --> 02:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:43:22.490 --> 02:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
so you had stated that you were
 
02:43:24.830 --> 02:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
representing the 26 hospitals in the
 
02:43:26.330 --> 02:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
state and I just have a question related
 
02:43:28.910 --> 02:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
to that do you know if the hospitals
 
02:43:32.389 --> 02:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
would be on board with I know one of the
 
02:43:33.889 --> 02:43:33.899 align:start position:0%
biggest issues with getting these panels
 
02:43:35.210 --> 02:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
was actually getting a physician to
 
02:43:37.670 --> 02:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
participate in them are the hospitals on
 
02:43:39.110 --> 02:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
board with
 
02:43:40.670 --> 02:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
putting something in the physician's
 
02:43:43.309 --> 02:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
contracts that they have to participate
 
02:43:45.410 --> 02:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
in like say one of these panels every
 
02:43:47.330 --> 02:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
certain number of years
 
02:43:49.969 --> 02:43:49.979 align:start position:0%
um I I would not I don't have the
 
02:43:52.070 --> 02:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
authority to to state that at this time
 
02:43:53.809 --> 02:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
that but I think that is
 
02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
um if that is one of the problems I do
 
02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:57.110 align:start position:0%
um if that is one of the problems I do
understand

02:43:57.110 --> 02:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:43:59.450 --> 02:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
um that the current system involved
 
02:43:59.460 --> 02:44:00.710 align:start position:0%
um that the current system involved
working

02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
um with um
 
02:44:04.370 --> 02:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
reaching out to doctors through the
 
02:44:06.830 --> 02:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
medical society but certainly we could
 
02:44:08.750 --> 02:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
help in that regard as well because
 
02:44:11.389 --> 02:44:11.399 align:start position:0%
obviously you need you need experts to
 
02:44:13.130 --> 02:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
be on the panel so that that certainly
 
02:44:15.370 --> 02:44:15.380 align:start position:0%
is would be a fair consideration
 
02:44:17.990 --> 02:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander
 
02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair
 
02:44:22.429 --> 02:44:22.439 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me you're just asking for
 
02:44:24.290 --> 02:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
time and because this bill is in the
 
02:44:25.849 --> 02:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
possession of the Judiciary Committee
 
02:44:28.309 --> 02:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
would the summer be enough time for you
 
02:44:30.170 --> 02:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
to have conversations with stakeholders
 
02:44:32.389 --> 02:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
or do you believe there needs to be more
 
02:44:35.510 --> 02:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
time and what would more time get you
 
02:44:37.309 --> 02:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
um we have we can act on this bill up
 
02:44:39.530 --> 02:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
until November 1st so sure
 
02:44:43.070 --> 02:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
um well the we were hoping for a two to
 
02:44:46.010 --> 02:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
three year pause and then delay of
 
02:44:51.830 --> 02:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
repeal I believe we were looking at 2026
 
02:44:54.650 --> 02:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
um so um because everyone's very busy
 
02:44:57.469 --> 02:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
and um and I think that there needs to
 
02:44:59.570 --> 02:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
be some thoughtful discussions and
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
bringing folks together and when you
 
02:45:03.650 --> 02:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
when you bring stakeholders together
 
02:45:06.530 --> 02:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
that is um that's a time time consuming
 
02:45:09.290 --> 02:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
process and to do it fairly I would say
 
02:45:13.309 --> 02:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
we'd need some time and to get through
 
02:45:15.950 --> 02:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
another idea was to get into the next
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
budget cycle if if there are changes
 
02:45:19.849 --> 02:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
that needed to be made and
 
02:45:22.190 --> 02:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
Appropriations needed to be considered
 
02:45:25.070 --> 02:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
so that would I don't I don't believe
 
02:45:27.349 --> 02:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
um the summer time would be enough time
 
02:45:31.309 --> 02:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:34.969 --> 02:45:34.979 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh it
 
02:45:37.130 --> 02:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
appears to me you're talking two or
 
02:45:39.230 --> 02:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
three years to come up with something
 
02:45:42.110 --> 02:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
we're settling so few of these
 
02:45:45.770 --> 02:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
that if we lose two or three years of
 
02:45:49.969 --> 02:45:49.979 align:start position:0%
case settlements to this to this method
 
02:45:51.490 --> 02:45:51.500 align:start position:0%
they really won't make much difference
 
02:45:54.889 --> 02:45:54.899 align:start position:0%
so we could just get rid of the of the
 
02:45:57.290 --> 02:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
legislation you could have whatever
 
02:46:00.650 --> 02:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
meetings you want to put together a more
 
02:46:02.830 --> 02:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable method
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh and uh you know and then you'd have
 
02:46:07.730 --> 02:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
what you wanted I mean I don't
 
02:46:10.730 --> 02:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
understand why just suspending it or
 
02:46:12.110 --> 02:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
holding it or trying something like that
 
02:46:15.349 --> 02:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:19.250 --> 02:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
um in my experience of um
 
02:46:21.410 --> 02:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
I'm having trouble seeing you um in my
 
02:46:23.809 --> 02:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
experience unfortunately once you repeal
 
02:46:26.389 --> 02:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
a statute it is really really difficult
 
02:46:28.190 --> 02:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
to get it back
 
02:46:31.010 --> 02:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
um so that is the reason we and I don't
 
02:46:34.309 --> 02:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
honestly I don't see quite the a
 
02:46:36.469 --> 02:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
difference of just pot we're pausing the
 
02:46:39.710 --> 02:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
process and delaying the repeal
 
02:46:42.650 --> 02:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
um I guess I could um this is this is
 
02:46:44.270 --> 02:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
all I mean I'm never in front of this
 
02:46:46.910 --> 02:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
committee but I'm in front of HHS a lot
 
02:46:48.889 --> 02:46:48.899 align:start position:0%
um and a good example that we went
 
02:46:48.899 --> 02:46:49.610 align:start position:0%
um and a good example that we went
through

02:46:49.610 --> 02:46:49.620 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:46:50.929 --> 02:46:50.939 align:start position:0%
um and worked with rep with
 
02:46:53.090 --> 02:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
representative Neil Kirk was the repeal
 
02:46:56.090 --> 02:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
of the con a certificate of need we had
 
02:47:00.230 --> 02:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
a five-year repeal date in that Pro in
 
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
that that gave us
 
02:47:03.770 --> 02:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
um we knew it was going to happen but it
 
02:47:06.770 --> 02:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
gave us time to create a a different
 
02:47:08.150 --> 02:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
system and it's called the special
 
02:47:10.790 --> 02:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
healthcare service um system that um
 
02:47:13.429 --> 02:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
license that Senator Bradley worked with
 
02:47:14.929 --> 02:47:14.939 align:start position:0%
us and it is
 
02:47:17.570 --> 02:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
um something that is is thoughtful
 
02:47:21.349 --> 02:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
um and and protects the patients it is
 
02:47:23.570 --> 02:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
um it's look it's trying to save money
 
02:47:26.330 --> 02:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
and it is not certificate of need
 
02:47:28.730 --> 02:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
because we knew that was going away but
 
02:47:31.490 --> 02:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
it gave us the time to get something on
 
02:47:34.969 --> 02:47:34.979 align:start position:0%
in place in in place of certificate of
 
02:47:34.979 --> 02:47:35.929 align:start position:0%
in place in in place of certificate of
need

02:47:35.929 --> 02:47:35.939 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
um so that is that's and I guess my only
 
02:47:42.050 --> 02:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
example or analogy that um and I worked
 
02:47:44.570 --> 02:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
very very hard on that bill and I I am
 
02:47:47.090 --> 02:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
we're very proud of that law so
 
02:47:49.190 --> 02:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
um that's an example of
 
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
um working with the legislature and just
 
02:47:55.790 --> 02:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
in the meantime I guess I just it is
 
02:47:58.790 --> 02:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
delaying the repeal but it's um I don't
 
02:48:00.590 --> 02:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
see it's not like the process would
 
02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
continue it's still being paused
 
02:48:06.530 --> 02:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
what other so I guess I I guess I have a
 
02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
question I mean isn't that a significant
 
02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:10.730 align:start position:0%
question I mean isn't that a significant
distinction

02:48:10.730 --> 02:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
02:48:12.950 --> 02:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
because correct me if I'm wrong but
 
02:48:14.929 --> 02:48:14.939 align:start position:0%
during this five-year window of the
 
02:48:17.510 --> 02:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
certificate of need process
 
02:48:19.910 --> 02:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
being replaced coming to an end and
 
02:48:21.410 --> 02:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
being replaced
 
02:48:23.210 --> 02:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
during that five-year period the
 
02:48:25.250 --> 02:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
certificate of need remained in effect
 
02:48:27.950 --> 02:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
yes that's right but what you're talking
 
02:48:30.889 --> 02:48:30.899 align:start position:0%
about here is if we accept what I think
 
02:48:33.349 --> 02:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
you're proposing we would suspend
 
02:48:36.349 --> 02:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
immediately the screening panel process
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
and with the possibility that it might
 
02:48:42.710 --> 02:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
come back in three years and so I guess
 
02:48:44.990 --> 02:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'm you know what
 
02:48:46.969 --> 02:48:46.979 align:start position:0%
and I please understand I don't direct
 
02:48:49.610 --> 02:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
this at you in any way personally but I
 
02:48:49.620 --> 02:48:50.570 align:start position:0%
this at you in any way personally but I
what

02:48:50.570 --> 02:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:48:53.570 --> 02:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
this really smacks of to me is
 
02:48:55.670 --> 02:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
if if you're willing to have this be
 
02:48:57.530 --> 02:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
suspended for three years you're sort of
 
02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
admitting it doesn't really do anything
 
02:49:00.770 --> 02:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
we don't really need if we don't have
 
02:49:02.510 --> 02:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
this in effect for the next three years
 
02:49:06.230 --> 02:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
the sky isn't going to fall in and so if
 
02:49:08.270 --> 02:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
02:49:10.190 --> 02:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
um then that seems to me a significant
 
02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
difference from the from the certificate
 
02:49:16.370 --> 02:49:16.380 align:start position:0%
of need example and it frankly it's sort
 
02:49:18.770 --> 02:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
of it it kind of I have to say honestly
 
02:49:21.290 --> 02:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
it smacks to me of like let's just see
 
02:49:23.510 --> 02:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
if we can you know if we can just hang
 
02:49:26.210 --> 02:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
on to a thread maybe there'll be some
 
02:49:28.010 --> 02:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
way in three years that we'll be able to
 
02:49:30.590 --> 02:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
get this resurrected whereas as
 
02:49:32.210 --> 02:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
representative testerman was pointing
 
02:49:35.630 --> 02:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
out why if this you know if it if we
 
02:49:37.010 --> 02:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
repeal this
 
02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
and and and somehow on the unexpected to
 
02:49:42.950 --> 02:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
all of us the sky falls in which I don't
 
02:49:45.469 --> 02:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
from all we've seen in the in the over
 
02:49:47.030 --> 02:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years I don't think that's
 
02:49:49.370 --> 02:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
going to happen but if the sky did fall
 
02:49:52.190 --> 02:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
in we can reenact the law
 
02:49:53.750 --> 02:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know we could just take it off take
 
02:49:57.050 --> 02:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
519 off the shelf I suppose and reenact
 
02:49:57.060 --> 02:49:59.030 align:start position:0%
519 off the shelf I suppose and reenact
it

02:49:59.030 --> 02:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:50:01.010 --> 02:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
I think the difference is we're not
 
02:50:05.450 --> 02:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
asking to just reinstate the the panels
 
02:50:09.349 --> 02:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
as they exist we're looking for time as
 
02:50:12.170 --> 02:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
the again this was never our idea this
 
02:50:14.270 --> 02:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
was um presented by the judicial panel
 
02:50:16.370 --> 02:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
and they wanted to repeal it because it
 
02:50:17.690 --> 02:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
wasn't working
 
02:50:19.790 --> 02:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
um but remember we were coming out of a
 
02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:21.050 align:start position:0%
um but remember we were coming out of a
three-year

02:50:21.050 --> 02:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
three-year
 
02:50:21.060 --> 02:50:22.190 align:start position:0%
three-year
um horrible

02:50:22.190 --> 02:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
um horrible
 
02:50:25.849 --> 02:50:25.859 align:start position:0%
um pandemic and the hospitals were at
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
the front lines of that so we were well
 
02:50:30.170 --> 02:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
aware of that um and to just say let's
 
02:50:31.969 --> 02:50:31.979 align:start position:0%
repeal it it's like wait a minute you
 
02:50:33.710 --> 02:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to do anything after three
 
02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
years of a pandemic without thinking
 
02:50:38.450 --> 02:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
this through we we tried and we
 
02:50:42.050 --> 02:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
suggested the medical community
 
02:50:44.809 --> 02:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
um that we have a study committee
 
02:50:46.910 --> 02:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
because we did not agree that just
 
02:50:50.090 --> 02:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
repealing outright because again there
 
02:50:51.170 --> 02:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
are other
 
02:50:54.349 --> 02:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
options out there and so
 
02:50:56.630 --> 02:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
maybe not everyone agrees that we should
 
02:50:59.650 --> 02:50:59.660 align:start position:0%
have another option we prefer that
 
02:51:02.330 --> 02:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity to consider another option
 
02:51:03.770 --> 02:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
that's all we're saying well I'm not
 
02:51:05.929 --> 02:51:05.939 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to just put back in
 
02:51:08.030 --> 02:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
um what the the panels that we have
 
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
today because like you said I don't
 
02:51:10.969 --> 02:51:10.979 align:start position:0%
think they're working
 
02:51:13.490 --> 02:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
um and there are reasons again the Dual
 
02:51:15.950 --> 02:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
track is one reason that they may not be
 
02:51:18.230 --> 02:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
working that's all all right other
 
02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness uh yes
 
02:51:22.130 --> 02:51:22.140 align:start position:0%
representative Smith then representative
 
02:51:24.410 --> 02:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
Perez and representative Morgan
 
02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:51:25.920 --> 02:51:26.830 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:51:26.830 --> 02:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:29.389 --> 02:51:29.399 align:start position:0%
what if we were
 
02:51:33.610 --> 02:51:33.620 align:start position:0%
to itl the Senate bill
 
02:51:33.620 --> 02:51:35.450 align:start position:0%
to itl the Senate bill
and

02:51:35.450 --> 02:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:51:36.770 --> 02:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
keep things
 
02:51:40.370 --> 02:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
as they are
 
02:51:45.349 --> 02:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
um would that mean we would be would we
 
02:51:47.929 --> 02:51:47.939 align:start position:0%
therefore be eliminating any
 
02:51:47.939 --> 02:51:50.210 align:start position:0%
therefore be eliminating any
encouragement

02:51:50.210 --> 02:51:50.220 align:start position:0%
encouragement
 
02:51:52.809 --> 02:51:52.819 align:start position:0%
that all the parties
 
02:51:56.450 --> 02:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
might need in order to look at how that
 
02:51:58.610 --> 02:51:58.620 align:start position:0%
system works and see if there's a way to
 
02:52:00.889 --> 02:52:00.899 align:start position:0%
improve it
 
02:52:04.670 --> 02:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
that's another approach to if everyone
 
02:52:06.710 --> 02:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
believes that it's not working to sit
 
02:52:09.530 --> 02:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
down and and try to work something out
 
02:52:11.510 --> 02:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
I think I'm I think I'm answering your
 
02:52:11.520 --> 02:52:12.889 align:start position:0%
I think I'm I think I'm answering your
question

02:52:12.889 --> 02:52:12.899 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:52:15.170 --> 02:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
did you say it would not encourage
 
02:52:17.269 --> 02:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
because I think it would encourage don't
 
02:52:20.570 --> 02:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
you well I don't know because it's been
 
02:52:22.910 --> 02:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
here for quite a while right there have
 
02:52:27.469 --> 02:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
been almost no the numbers that are
 
02:52:30.710 --> 02:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
involved are very very low they would
 
02:52:32.570 --> 02:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
not indicate
 
02:52:37.250 --> 02:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
that this is something that makes sense
 
02:52:37.260 --> 02:52:37.910 align:start position:0%
that this is something that makes sense
um

02:52:37.910 --> 02:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:40.969 --> 02:52:40.979 align:start position:0%
that being the case we could just go
 
02:52:43.370 --> 02:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
ahead with the Senate proposal and
 
02:52:45.469 --> 02:52:45.479 align:start position:0%
repeal period
 
02:52:50.510 --> 02:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
we can say put it on hold
 
02:52:55.010 --> 02:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
if we had any reason to believe that by
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
putting it on hold that the interested
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
parties would in fact do something about
 
02:53:02.510 --> 02:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:53:04.690 --> 02:53:04.700 align:start position:0%
improve it
 
02:53:08.690 --> 02:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
or we could do something more drastic I
 
02:53:10.610 --> 02:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
mean for example
 
02:53:13.790 --> 02:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
the one particular example is that Maine
 
02:53:17.750 --> 02:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
requires the panels right and so it
 
02:53:20.570 --> 02:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
might just be okay let's just dabble a
 
02:53:23.150 --> 02:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
little bit and require the panels and
 
02:53:28.309 --> 02:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:31.910 --> 02:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
the bill is here because rather than in
 
02:53:33.590 --> 02:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services or another
 
02:53:35.809 --> 02:53:35.819 align:start position:0%
committee because of the role of the
 
02:53:39.290 --> 02:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
judicial branch plays in this
 
02:53:39.300 --> 02:53:40.490 align:start position:0%
judicial branch plays in this
um

02:53:40.490 --> 02:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:40.500 --> 02:53:43.550 align:start position:0%
um
uh

02:53:43.550 --> 02:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:47.690 --> 02:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to see what in fact we as
 
02:53:50.150 --> 02:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
a legislature should do that would make
 
02:53:53.630 --> 02:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
these independent parties
 
02:53:55.570 --> 02:53:55.580 align:start position:0%
um step up to the plate
 
02:53:58.130 --> 02:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
well I for one
 
02:54:00.469 --> 02:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
um can speak for the hospital
 
02:54:03.349 --> 02:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
Association that we are interested in
 
02:54:03.359 --> 02:54:04.130 align:start position:0%
Association that we are interested in
actually

02:54:04.130 --> 02:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:54:06.830 --> 02:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
having stakeholders come together and
 
02:54:08.510 --> 02:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
whether we have a study committee a
 
02:54:10.670 --> 02:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee or not and I
 
02:54:12.290 --> 02:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
think that's why we're saying if you
 
02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
pause it we we're committed to trying to
 
02:54:16.969 --> 02:54:16.979 align:start position:0%
look at Alternatives
 
02:54:19.070 --> 02:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
um I don't I we didn't have the time to
 
02:54:21.889 --> 02:54:21.899 align:start position:0%
do that when we became aware of the of
 
02:54:25.849 --> 02:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 65 being introduced to
 
02:54:28.490 --> 02:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
um and well the original plan excuse me
 
02:54:30.950 --> 02:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
not 65 as introduced because that was a
 
02:54:32.750 --> 02:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
study committee because that was after
 
02:54:35.510 --> 02:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
we did Richard head did bring us
 
02:54:38.990 --> 02:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
together and um we we did and the
 
02:54:41.929 --> 02:54:41.939 align:start position:0%
medical society did ask for it for it to
 
02:54:44.990 --> 02:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
be studied so that's how I think 65 came
 
02:54:47.750 --> 02:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
to be not all the stakeholders that were
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
in that room um are in the zoom room I
 
02:54:51.349 --> 02:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
should say
 
02:54:53.510 --> 02:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
um apparently agreed with that um so
 
02:54:55.730 --> 02:54:55.740 align:start position:0%
that's why that's why you have the bill
 
02:54:57.790 --> 02:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
before you
 
02:55:00.050 --> 02:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
02:55:03.769 --> 02:55:03.779 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
02:55:05.870 --> 02:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
if you wait
 
02:55:08.450 --> 02:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
if you keep this the way it is or freeze
 
02:55:10.490 --> 02:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
it or whatever you want to do and then
 
02:55:12.530 --> 02:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
you come back
 
02:55:16.309 --> 02:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
in three years is that what you're you
 
02:55:19.130 --> 02:55:19.140 align:start position:0%
have to start all over again you you
 
02:55:20.809 --> 02:55:20.819 align:start position:0%
have to start all you're going to have
 
02:55:23.750 --> 02:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
another perhaps another huge different
 
02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:25.370 align:start position:0%
another perhaps another huge different
group

02:55:25.370 --> 02:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
group
 
02:55:27.650 --> 02:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
um I I personally am not for putting
 
02:55:30.590 --> 02:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
Band-Aids on something I personally
 
02:55:34.190 --> 02:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
think it makes more sense to start fresh
 
02:55:40.190 --> 02:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
with something and say we had a we had a
 
02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:40.910 align:start position:0%
with something and say we had a we had a
um

02:55:40.910 --> 02:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:43.849 --> 02:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
statute that didn't work and this is why
 
02:55:45.110 --> 02:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
it didn't work
 
02:55:48.769 --> 02:55:48.779 align:start position:0%
rather than band-aiding it it just I've
 
02:55:50.630 --> 02:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
worked in the healthcare field for 42
 
02:55:52.969 --> 02:55:52.979 align:start position:0%
years as an intensive care nurse I get
 
02:55:55.910 --> 02:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
it I know it's very difficult the thing
 
02:55:58.070 --> 02:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
I saw immediately with this wrong is
 
02:55:59.929 --> 02:55:59.939 align:start position:0%
that you had two paths going at the same
 
02:56:02.150 --> 02:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
time I agree with you two pass at the
 
02:56:05.330 --> 02:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
same time that's ridiculous right and um
 
02:56:07.910 --> 02:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
but I wasn't here when that came out
 
02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:09.050 align:start position:0%
but I wasn't here when that came out
yeah

02:56:09.050 --> 02:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:56:09.060 --> 02:56:10.010 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

02:56:10.010 --> 02:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:14.450 --> 02:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
so you know I just think fresh to me I
 
02:56:16.670 --> 02:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
don't understand why and I know you say
 
02:56:18.290 --> 02:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
it's because you see if something goes
 
02:56:20.090 --> 02:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
away but you're gonna put together
 
02:56:22.030 --> 02:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
something that's entirely different
 
02:56:25.010 --> 02:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
you're looking to put together maybe a
 
02:56:29.150 --> 02:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
mediation prior to and
 
02:56:31.790 --> 02:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
um this hasn't this wasn't working prior
 
02:56:35.690 --> 02:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
to 217. so my question is
 
02:56:37.969 --> 02:56:37.979 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see you give us some credit
 
02:56:41.090 --> 02:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
that we could bring it back perhaps and
 
02:56:44.330 --> 02:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
you know different people different
 
02:56:46.910 --> 02:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
different outcomes so
 
02:56:49.370 --> 02:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
um I guess my question is would you
 
02:56:52.250 --> 02:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
consider it this going away starting
 
02:56:52.260 --> 02:56:53.510 align:start position:0%
consider it this going away starting
fresh

02:56:53.510 --> 02:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
fresh
 
02:56:57.349 --> 02:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:00.050 --> 02:57:00.060 align:start position:0%
I completely respect what you're saying
 
02:57:03.170 --> 02:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
and of and I understand your perspective
 
02:57:06.050 --> 02:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
um again there I think you're right
 
02:57:08.269 --> 02:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the problem with the
 
02:57:09.950 --> 02:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
current system is it's a dual track
 
02:57:13.610 --> 02:57:13.620 align:start position:0%
there are other systems like Maine and I
 
02:57:15.590 --> 02:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
think representative Smith identified
 
02:57:18.830 --> 02:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
that and others that is an example of a
 
02:57:21.050 --> 02:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
system that really does work and there
 
02:57:22.790 --> 02:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
are lawyers in New Hampshire that work
 
02:57:25.309 --> 02:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
in both States and have said to me
 
02:57:28.550 --> 02:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
outright the main system does work
 
02:57:32.090 --> 02:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
um so by that's why we were supportive
 
02:57:34.969 --> 02:57:34.979 align:start position:0%
of 70 of 65 as introduced it was a study
 
02:57:36.889 --> 02:57:36.899 align:start position:0%
committee and that would have given us
 
02:57:39.410 --> 02:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to say this is the
 
02:57:41.150 --> 02:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
current system and the force it does
 
02:57:42.769 --> 02:57:42.779 align:start position:0%
force people to the table
 
02:57:44.750 --> 02:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
um and that that is the good part of
 
02:57:46.190 --> 02:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
passing a study committee or a
 
02:57:48.889 --> 02:57:48.899 align:start position:0%
commission I know I know it's a lot of
 
02:57:51.590 --> 02:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
work on for everyone but it forces
 
02:57:54.769 --> 02:57:54.779 align:start position:0%
people at the table to actually
 
02:57:57.910 --> 02:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
that understand the system to consider
 
02:58:01.610 --> 02:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
alternatives and to bring ideas
 
02:58:04.670 --> 02:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
um again if we
 
02:58:07.309 --> 02:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
we were just trying to we're not you
 
02:58:09.769 --> 02:58:09.779 align:start position:0%
could go back to 65 as introduced but we
 
02:58:12.230 --> 02:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
weren't we were saying
 
02:58:15.410 --> 02:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
um why don't we just pause and then
 
02:58:17.990 --> 02:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
possibly just delay the repeal so it's
 
02:58:20.210 --> 02:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a it's another alternative
 
02:58:22.910 --> 02:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
that's all but uh it the as you stated
 
02:58:25.250 --> 02:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
the bills in your committee it is up to
 
02:58:27.830 --> 02:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
you our position is that we would like
 
02:58:30.590 --> 02:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to try to look at
 
02:58:33.469 --> 02:58:33.479 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and again from my
 
02:58:36.650 --> 02:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
experience once you lose once a statute
 
02:58:39.889 --> 02:58:39.899 align:start position:0%
is is repealed it is very difficult to
 
02:58:41.809 --> 02:58:41.819 align:start position:0%
come back that's all
 
02:58:44.809 --> 02:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes so you would be bringing
 
02:58:44.819 --> 02:58:48.590 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes so you would be bringing
forward

02:58:48.590 --> 02:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:50.990 --> 02:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
so you would not be Bandit band-aiding
 
02:58:53.210 --> 02:58:53.220 align:start position:0%
this one you would be bringing home it
 
02:58:55.969 --> 02:58:55.979 align:start position:0%
appears to from what you're saying you
 
02:58:57.950 --> 02:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
could possibly be bringing the main Bill
 
02:59:01.730 --> 02:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire it's it's still a um
 
02:59:04.330 --> 02:59:04.340 align:start position:0%
screening panel it's a it's a type of so
 
02:59:08.090 --> 02:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
I don't I have not looked at the statute
 
02:59:09.889 --> 02:59:09.899 align:start position:0%
to say what we would change in the
 
02:59:13.269 --> 02:59:13.279 align:start position:0%
statute again this was um this was not
 
02:59:16.070 --> 02:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
suggested by us um so we are just
 
02:59:19.190 --> 02:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
responding to a bill that was into that
 
02:59:22.010 --> 02:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
was presented by the judicial or an idea
 
02:59:25.309 --> 02:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
by the judicial branch and now what um
 
02:59:27.230 --> 02:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
we did not support the bill when it was
 
02:59:30.530 --> 02:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
repealed in the Senate um so now we are
 
02:59:33.170 --> 02:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
this is our position I I know that
 
02:59:34.550 --> 02:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
you're running out of time and I know
 
02:59:35.809 --> 02:59:35.819 align:start position:0%
there are others that want to speak
 
02:59:38.090 --> 02:59:38.100 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon yes it seems like
 
02:59:39.710 --> 02:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
what you're asking us to do is something
 
02:59:42.590 --> 02:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
along the lines of an amended version of
 
02:59:45.230 --> 02:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
the original Senate bill which has said
 
02:59:48.410 --> 02:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
section I didn't look at it until just
 
02:59:49.969 --> 02:59:49.979 align:start position:0%
now while I was sitting here but appears
 
02:59:51.590 --> 02:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
section one was a study committee
 
02:59:54.170 --> 02:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
section two was a
 
02:59:56.510 --> 02:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
suspensions would be no new claims but
 
02:59:58.790 --> 02:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
very but the exist three existing panels
 
03:00:00.230 --> 03:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
would still be able to continue their
 
03:00:01.910 --> 03:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
work and then
 
03:00:05.210 --> 03:00:05.220 align:start position:0%
um followed in the future by the repeal
 
03:00:07.010 --> 03:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
of the whole statute and that one was
 
03:00:09.230 --> 03:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
2024 you seem to think something more
 
03:00:12.170 --> 03:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
like 2026 is more appropriate so am I
 
03:00:13.610 --> 03:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
like interpreting your testimony right
 
03:00:16.790 --> 03:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
and yes yes so that's that that's what
 
03:00:18.290 --> 03:00:18.300 align:start position:0%
basically you're asking us to do is
 
03:00:20.870 --> 03:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
revive the original Senate version of
 
03:00:22.969 --> 03:00:22.979 align:start position:0%
the bill but without a study without a
 
03:00:24.710 --> 03:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
formal study committee I guess you could
 
03:00:26.450 --> 03:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
say yes thanks all right other questions
 
03:00:26.460 --> 03:00:28.429 align:start position:0%
say yes thanks all right other questions
representative

03:00:28.429 --> 03:00:28.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:00:30.950 --> 03:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe just following up on that um
 
03:00:33.290 --> 03:00:33.300 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking the question
 
03:00:33.300 --> 03:00:34.910 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking the question
um

03:00:34.910 --> 03:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:36.950 --> 03:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll frame it by saying you know
 
03:00:40.010 --> 03:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
we have heard about the strains on the
 
03:00:42.050 --> 03:00:42.060 align:start position:0%
court system multiple times in multiple
 
03:00:45.230 --> 03:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
ways we've heard about
 
03:00:48.530 --> 03:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
um a number of other extra you know I
 
03:00:49.849 --> 03:00:49.859 align:start position:0%
don't know what the word is not judicial
 
03:00:52.790 --> 03:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
but extra court system processes in
 
03:00:54.950 --> 03:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
other areas you know and most people
 
03:00:56.929 --> 03:00:56.939 align:start position:0%
have said those were working very well
 
03:00:59.450 --> 03:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
and people took advantage of those
 
03:00:59.460 --> 03:01:00.050 align:start position:0%
and people took advantage of those
um

03:01:00.050 --> 03:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:02.469 --> 03:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
am I writing in that
 
03:01:06.170 --> 03:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
essentially Mr head's reason for for
 
03:01:08.030 --> 03:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
proposing this in the first place was
 
03:01:10.490 --> 03:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
essentially to take the burden off of
 
03:01:12.769 --> 03:01:12.779 align:start position:0%
them in the short term
 
03:01:15.230 --> 03:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily to be opposed to the
 
03:01:17.750 --> 03:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
concept but to be opposed to the the
 
03:01:22.130 --> 03:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
resource utilization and and and did I
 
03:01:23.389 --> 03:01:23.399 align:start position:0%
understand you saying that there was
 
03:01:25.550 --> 03:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
original the original agreement sort of
 
03:01:27.950 --> 03:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
not not in this in the statute but was
 
03:01:30.710 --> 03:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
but was around basically
 
03:01:33.650 --> 03:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
taking time to to revise this or see if
 
03:01:38.090 --> 03:01:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:40.550 --> 03:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
and the idea behind your I guess
 
03:01:42.710 --> 03:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
constant's conceptual Amendment would be
 
03:01:44.570 --> 03:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
that if nothing happens within three
 
03:01:47.090 --> 03:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
years the bill would still repeal
 
03:01:49.250 --> 03:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
correct the bill would still repeal in
 
03:01:51.710 --> 03:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
three years I I hesitate
 
03:01:53.450 --> 03:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
um representative to
 
03:01:56.389 --> 03:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
um to put to speak for Richard head um
 
03:01:58.070 --> 03:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
and I he's not here
 
03:02:00.950 --> 03:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
um but we do um we have talked with with
 
03:02:00.960 --> 03:02:01.849 align:start position:0%
um but we do um we have talked with with
him

03:02:01.849 --> 03:02:01.859 align:start position:0%
him
 
03:02:06.050 --> 03:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
um and um I I don't I think he could he
 
03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
understands our position
 
03:02:09.530 --> 03:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
um he knows that we do not support the
 
03:02:09.540 --> 03:02:10.730 align:start position:0%
um he knows that we do not support the
repeal

03:02:10.730 --> 03:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
03:02:12.349 --> 03:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe
 
03:02:14.630 --> 03:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
um he and I think the judicial branch
 
03:02:14.640 --> 03:02:15.769 align:start position:0%
um he and I think the judicial branch
representative

03:02:15.769 --> 03:02:15.779 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:02:18.410 --> 03:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
um testified that he understood and I
 
03:02:21.050 --> 03:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
think he could I believe could but I
 
03:02:23.330 --> 03:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
could live with our idea but I don't I
 
03:02:25.370 --> 03:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
don't want to actually um even say that
 
03:02:29.870 --> 03:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:32.030 --> 03:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
so when the bill was initially
 
03:02:35.269 --> 03:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
introduced it was only to have a member
 
03:02:37.309 --> 03:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
of the Senate and then three members of
 
03:02:42.050 --> 03:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:44.870 --> 03:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
is anybody or any
 
03:02:46.730 --> 03:02:46.740 align:start position:0%
body from the hospital Association or
 
03:02:49.670 --> 03:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
anybody gonna team up on trying to come
 
03:02:51.410 --> 03:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
up with a resolution or is the
 
03:02:53.210 --> 03:02:53.220 align:start position:0%
expectation just that the general court
 
03:02:55.610 --> 03:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
figure out a solution well the way study
 
03:02:57.590 --> 03:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
committees typically work
 
03:02:59.809 --> 03:02:59.819 align:start position:0%
um representative is that the interested
 
03:03:01.490 --> 03:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
parties certainly participate in that
 
03:03:02.929 --> 03:03:02.939 align:start position:0%
it's just a difference between a
 
03:03:04.849 --> 03:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
commission and a committee a study
 
03:03:07.130 --> 03:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
committee and a commission but yes of
 
03:03:09.710 --> 03:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
course we would participate
 
03:03:11.870 --> 03:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness seeing
 
03:03:13.849 --> 03:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much thank you but
 
03:03:16.490 --> 03:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on Dave gottisman
 
03:03:23.530 --> 03:03:23.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:30.530 --> 03:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:34.550 --> 03:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
I thank you uh I'm David goddessman uh

passed in 2005 over my objection at that
 
03:03:48.479 --> 03:03:49.370 align:start position:0%
passed in 2005 over my objection at that
time

03:04:08.210 --> 03:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association for justice and I
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
have to confess uh Mr chairman I'm very
 
03:04:12.410 --> 03:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable not standing to address
 
03:04:17.330 --> 03:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:21.050 --> 03:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
I think before uh I get into my comments
 
03:04:22.670 --> 03:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
there are a couple things that I think
 
03:04:25.370 --> 03:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
maybe the committee is not aware of in
 
03:04:28.429 --> 03:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
how this process works there was a
 
03:04:30.590 --> 03:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
comment about uh
 
03:04:33.950 --> 03:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
the panel being assembled I just want to
 
03:04:35.570 --> 03:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
explain that once
 
03:04:40.550 --> 03:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
the retired judge assembles a lawyer
 
03:04:42.230 --> 03:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
and a doctor
 
03:04:44.510 --> 03:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
and a panel is actually convened if it
 
03:04:47.030 --> 03:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
if it actually takes place
 
03:04:50.090 --> 03:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
and both parties have to pay for expert
 
03:04:52.610 --> 03:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
witnesses to participate in that
 
03:04:55.849 --> 03:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
proceeding as if it were a trial
 
03:04:57.469 --> 03:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
the finding
 
03:04:58.969 --> 03:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
can be
 
03:05:01.670 --> 03:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
three to three to zero
 
03:05:04.010 --> 03:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
two to one in favor
 
03:05:07.309 --> 03:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
one to two in favor which means it's
 
03:05:10.969 --> 03:05:10.979 align:start position:0%
against or three to zero
 
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
that there is no malpractice
 
03:05:14.160 --> 03:05:15.530 align:start position:0%
that there is no malpractice
so

03:05:15.530 --> 03:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:05:18.590 --> 03:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
what happens with that finding if it is
 
03:05:21.550 --> 03:05:21.560 align:start position:0%
three to zero under any circumstances
 
03:05:25.490 --> 03:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
either for or against that can be
 
03:05:25.500 --> 03:05:26.570 align:start position:0%
either for or against that can be
admitted

03:05:26.570 --> 03:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
admitted
 
03:05:28.550 --> 03:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
to a jury trial
 
03:05:31.550 --> 03:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
in front of a jury it is not binding on
 
03:05:33.710 --> 03:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
them it is just additional information
 
03:05:36.889 --> 03:05:36.899 align:start position:0%
that a preliminary hearing happened with
 
03:05:39.230 --> 03:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
a panel and that's explained by the
 
03:05:42.889 --> 03:05:42.899 align:start position:0%
court and that that is before them and
 
03:05:44.690 --> 03:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
that the jury can make their own
 
03:05:47.690 --> 03:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
decision about how this case should come
 
03:05:50.510 --> 03:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
out could come out regardless of what
 
03:05:52.730 --> 03:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
the panel said
 
03:05:55.250 --> 03:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
so in many cases where it's two to one
 
03:05:57.469 --> 03:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
people have spent an inordinate amount
 
03:05:58.550 --> 03:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
of money
 
03:06:01.429 --> 03:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
and it is all for naught because it is
 
03:06:03.590 --> 03:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
if it never happened
 
03:06:06.950 --> 03:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
so in the rare cases that it's 3-0 then
 
03:06:08.809 --> 03:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
the question of how it's handled at
 
03:06:12.110 --> 03:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
trial comes before the court
 
03:06:12.120 --> 03:06:13.450 align:start position:0%
trial comes before the court
uh

03:06:13.450 --> 03:06:13.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:06:18.469 --> 03:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
representative uh Oregon I think is are
 
03:06:21.710 --> 03:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
you I representative or again yeah
 
03:06:26.990 --> 03:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
I think uh asked uh who can wave the
 
03:06:29.389 --> 03:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
panel uh how many people it takes both
 
03:06:32.210 --> 03:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
attorneys to waive the panel one
 
03:06:34.849 --> 03:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
attorney cannot wave the panel on their
 
03:06:34.859 --> 03:06:36.170 align:start position:0%
attorney cannot wave the panel on their
own

03:06:36.170 --> 03:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
own
 
03:06:39.710 --> 03:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
so uh one of the things that happens is
 
03:06:42.889 --> 03:06:42.899 align:start position:0%
as these cases are proceeding one a
 
03:06:45.590 --> 03:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
panel proceeding and one a regular Court
 
03:06:45.600 --> 03:06:46.849 align:start position:0%
panel proceeding and one a regular Court
proceeding

03:06:46.849 --> 03:06:46.859 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
03:06:49.670 --> 03:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
time is being spent on both money is
 
03:06:52.490 --> 03:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
being spent by both sides
 
03:06:56.090 --> 03:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
and the court has assigned a retired
 
03:06:59.030 --> 03:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
judge to assemble a panel which
 
03:07:02.090 --> 03:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes has conflicts which sometimes
 
03:07:04.670 --> 03:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
has uh
 
03:07:07.790 --> 03:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
their own cases to handle and when I say
 
03:07:09.410 --> 03:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
conflicts I mean conflicts of interest
 
03:07:11.090 --> 03:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
because they know the lawyer they know
 
03:07:13.790 --> 03:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
the doctor and then it becomes a matter
 
03:07:16.010 --> 03:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
of when can we schedule this and then
 
03:07:18.230 --> 03:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
there are those conflicts and those are
 
03:07:20.210 --> 03:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
the realities of what's happening with
 
03:07:21.650 --> 03:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
this system
 
03:07:21.660 --> 03:07:23.030 align:start position:0%
this system
uh

03:07:23.030 --> 03:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:07:25.190 --> 03:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things that has not really
 
03:07:27.710 --> 03:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
been focused on is at the time that this
 
03:07:30.190 --> 03:07:30.200 align:start position:0%
happened at the time of this legislation
 
03:07:33.650 --> 03:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
it first came before the legislature in
 
03:07:35.929 --> 03:07:35.939 align:start position:0%
2004 and it died in a committee of
 
03:07:35.939 --> 03:07:37.190 align:start position:0%
2004 and it died in a committee of
conference

03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
conference
 
03:07:39.950 --> 03:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
and then in 2005 the new bill came up
 
03:07:41.330 --> 03:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
and it passed
 
03:07:44.269 --> 03:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
but at the time if I recall correctly
 
03:07:48.769 --> 03:07:48.779 align:start position:0%
mediation was not a requirement in our
 
03:07:51.469 --> 03:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
legal system mediation is when the
 
03:07:53.870 --> 03:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
parties to a lawsuit are forced to get
 
03:07:57.110 --> 03:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
together and try to resolve the case
 
03:08:00.769 --> 03:08:00.779 align:start position:0%
an answer to representative uh
 
03:08:04.610 --> 03:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
pay Perez uh question this is the
 
03:08:07.429 --> 03:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity that people need to try to
 
03:08:09.050 --> 03:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
resolve the case
 
03:08:11.690 --> 03:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
uh I think of all the cases that get
 
03:08:11.700 --> 03:08:13.849 align:start position:0%
uh I think of all the cases that get
filed

03:08:13.849 --> 03:08:13.859 align:start position:0%
filed
 
03:08:16.490 --> 03:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
ninety percent of them go away through
 
03:08:18.950 --> 03:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
the court system they don't go to trial
 
03:08:21.230 --> 03:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
they either end up getting resolved or
 
03:08:24.469 --> 03:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
they get dismissed so we're talking
 
03:08:28.130 --> 03:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
about uh whether or not the the system
 
03:08:31.550 --> 03:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
as we know it which is a system that is
 
03:08:33.650 --> 03:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
run by a jury
 
03:08:36.230 --> 03:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
in every single case
 
03:08:39.889 --> 03:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
do we have confidence in the jury system
 
03:08:42.889 --> 03:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
we do and we feel that the jury system
 
03:08:44.330 --> 03:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
is working
 
03:08:46.849 --> 03:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:08:48.830 --> 03:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
in this legislation
 
03:08:50.990 --> 03:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh as
 
03:08:53.690 --> 03:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
has been brought out
 
03:08:55.490 --> 03:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
the insurance department was supposed to
 
03:08:57.349 --> 03:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
be reviewing this every
 
03:08:59.210 --> 03:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
so often and reporting to the
 
03:09:00.889 --> 03:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
legislature and the legislature was
 
03:09:02.630 --> 03:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to read these reports and the
 
03:09:04.190 --> 03:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
legislature was supposed to take action
 
03:09:06.710 --> 03:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
once the reports were given but what has
 
03:09:09.290 --> 03:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
really happened is nothing uh the
 
03:09:12.469 --> 03:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
insurance department has as of January
 
03:09:12.479 --> 03:09:13.210 align:start position:0%
insurance department has as of January
of

03:09:13.210 --> 03:09:13.220 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:09:15.830 --> 03:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
2023 and you have that report that was
 
03:09:19.610 --> 03:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
just submitted by uh Senator bird so
 
03:09:22.309 --> 03:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh says this is not working
 
03:09:24.469 --> 03:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
and this is something that should be
 
03:09:26.269 --> 03:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
done away with
 
03:09:28.070 --> 03:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
so the fear is I just want to talk about
 
03:09:30.110 --> 03:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
what the fears were at the time what we
 
03:09:30.120 --> 03:09:31.130 align:start position:0%
what the fears were at the time what we
heard

03:09:31.130 --> 03:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
heard
 
03:09:32.870 --> 03:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
we heard that it could be done in a
 
03:09:35.750 --> 03:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
timely manner it was promised that these
 
03:09:38.030 --> 03:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
panels would take no longer than six
 
03:09:42.469 --> 03:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
months at the outside to be completed
 
03:09:44.450 --> 03:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
it won't cost too much for the people
 
03:09:46.610 --> 03:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
who are injured
 
03:09:49.250 --> 03:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
and it'll change premiums
 
03:09:52.429 --> 03:09:52.439 align:start position:0%
and you can weed out frivolous cases
 
03:09:54.710 --> 03:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
and you can keep doctors from leaving
 
03:09:55.910 --> 03:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:09:57.889 --> 03:09:57.899 align:start position:0%
because there was some fear that because
 
03:10:00.110 --> 03:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
of malpractice premiums they were being
 
03:10:02.090 --> 03:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
forced to leave the state
 
03:10:03.950 --> 03:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
well what have we found
 
03:10:05.990 --> 03:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
it takes too long
 
03:10:08.809 --> 03:10:08.819 align:start position:0%
the Lays are lasting for more than a
 
03:10:11.570 --> 03:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
year with the panel while the case is
 
03:10:11.580 --> 03:10:13.070 align:start position:0%
year with the panel while the case is
proceeding

03:10:13.070 --> 03:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
03:10:15.410 --> 03:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
the panels are difficult to assemble as
 
03:10:17.269 --> 03:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
I said due to conflicts of interest and
 
03:10:18.950 --> 03:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
scheduling conflicts
 
03:10:21.110 --> 03:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's not changed the ultimate outcome
 
03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:22.490 align:start position:0%
it's not changed the ultimate outcome
side

03:10:22.490 --> 03:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
side
 
03:10:25.429 --> 03:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
it hasn't reduced the premiums
 
03:10:27.830 --> 03:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do effectively with
 
03:10:30.170 --> 03:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
weeding out frivolous cases and I and I
 
03:10:31.610 --> 03:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
will say
 
03:10:34.010 --> 03:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice cases are the
 
03:10:37.190 --> 03:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
hardest cases to bring before court they
 
03:10:39.969 --> 03:10:39.979 align:start position:0%
are defended uh
 
03:10:45.469 --> 03:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
fully and no stone is left unturned by
 
03:10:51.230 --> 03:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
the the the defense in these cases so uh
 
03:10:53.990 --> 03:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
no lawyer who knows what they're doing
 
03:10:56.330 --> 03:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
is going to bring these cases unless
 
03:10:59.389 --> 03:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
they they can project that it is
 
03:11:01.610 --> 03:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
worthwhile in bringing them
 
03:11:05.389 --> 03:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
the experts in these cases are
 
03:11:07.730 --> 03:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily expensive
 
03:11:10.429 --> 03:11:10.439 align:start position:0%
so if you have to have a panel you have
 
03:11:13.610 --> 03:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
to have an expert who testifies in some
 
03:11:16.010 --> 03:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
fashion at the panel so you're you're
 
03:11:19.490 --> 03:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
costing both sides double the expense in
 
03:11:22.190 --> 03:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
terms of handling the case
 
03:11:24.530 --> 03:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh the reports that you have before you
 
03:11:26.809 --> 03:11:26.819 align:start position:0%
show that the loss adjustment expenses
 
03:11:30.290 --> 03:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
which is legal fees are up for defense
 
03:11:33.170 --> 03:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
and that Indemnity money and settlements
 
03:11:36.230 --> 03:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
paid to the injured parties is less
 
03:11:39.230 --> 03:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
and is being waived as you can see from
 
03:11:41.330 --> 03:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
the statistics that have been presented
 
03:11:44.150 --> 03:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
to you almost all the time why is it
 
03:11:46.190 --> 03:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
being waived the attorneys on the
 
03:11:48.349 --> 03:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
defense do not have the power to waive
 
03:11:52.130 --> 03:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
the the uh panel on their own they have
 
03:11:54.530 --> 03:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
to ask their companies they are
 
03:11:56.269 --> 03:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
insurance companies who make a business
 
03:11:58.490 --> 03:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether or not it is
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
worth proceeding with a panel and a jury
 
03:12:06.050 --> 03:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
trial they have to evaluate the case and
 
03:12:07.910 --> 03:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
they do so and they're trying to save
 
03:12:10.790 --> 03:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
money and they do by saying the case is
 
03:12:12.590 --> 03:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
waived and we don't have to go to a
 
03:12:12.600 --> 03:12:14.630 align:start position:0%
waived and we don't have to go to a
panel

03:12:14.630 --> 03:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
panel
 
03:12:18.050 --> 03:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
one thing that I just want to address
 
03:12:20.809 --> 03:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
um is that that we we heard this
 
03:12:20.819 --> 03:12:21.889 align:start position:0%
um is that that we we heard this
suggestion

03:12:21.889 --> 03:12:21.899 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
03:12:25.790 --> 03:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
about two or three years someone handed
 
03:12:27.410 --> 03:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
me a draft for
 
03:12:31.790 --> 03:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
an amendment to Senate Bill 65 which
 
03:12:34.670 --> 03:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
says that basically this
 
03:12:37.370 --> 03:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
law should be suspended as of January
 
03:12:41.510 --> 03:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
1st 2023 which is you know behind us
 
03:12:43.610 --> 03:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
and that uh
 
03:12:45.710 --> 03:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
no action for medical injury shall be
 
03:12:47.809 --> 03:12:47.819 align:start position:0%
assigned to a screening panel
 
03:12:50.269 --> 03:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
and then three years from now
 
03:12:53.450 --> 03:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
the law will disappear
 
03:12:53.460 --> 03:12:54.889 align:start position:0%
the law will disappear
now

03:12:54.889 --> 03:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:12:54.899 --> 03:12:55.670 align:start position:0%
now
um

03:12:55.670 --> 03:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:57.950 --> 03:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
any of you who are in business
 
03:13:00.769 --> 03:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
know if you have a business problem
 
03:13:03.050 --> 03:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
know if the money's not coming in or
 
03:13:05.330 --> 03:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
things aren't going well you have to
 
03:13:07.490 --> 03:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
make decisions today
 
03:13:10.610 --> 03:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
you don't make a decision today
 
03:13:13.309 --> 03:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
that three years from now I'm going to
 
03:13:15.410 --> 03:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
end this problem
 
03:13:17.389 --> 03:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
this problem is something that was
 
03:13:19.309 --> 03:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
brought forward not by the Association
 
03:13:21.730 --> 03:13:21.740 align:start position:0%
for justice but by the court system
 
03:13:25.309 --> 03:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
asking you to consider the fact that
 
03:13:27.110 --> 03:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
this is not working
 
03:13:29.929 --> 03:13:29.939 align:start position:0%
when this meeting that was talked about
 
03:13:33.290 --> 03:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
was held between Richard head and the
 
03:13:37.610 --> 03:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:37.620 --> 03:13:38.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:13:38.349 --> 03:13:38.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:42.469 --> 03:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
the original plan was a complete repeal
 
03:13:45.650 --> 03:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
the compromise was that it would come in
 
03:13:47.510 --> 03:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
and they would have a study committee to
 
03:13:49.790 --> 03:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
do exactly what this last speaker said
 
03:13:51.590 --> 03:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
to see if they can come up with
 
03:13:51.600 --> 03:13:52.670 align:start position:0%
to see if they can come up with
something

03:13:52.670 --> 03:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:13:55.190 --> 03:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh one of the plans that was suggested
 
03:13:58.010 --> 03:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
was this main plant and unfortunately
 
03:14:01.429 --> 03:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
the attorney who testified at the Senate
 
03:14:03.950 --> 03:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
hearing Ben Gideon who was a malpractice
 
03:14:06.530 --> 03:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
lawyer from Maine was not able to come
 
03:14:09.230 --> 03:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
today but he told the the senate
 
03:14:11.150 --> 03:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
committee how terrible the system over
 
03:14:14.570 --> 03:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
there is I urge you to read his
 
03:14:16.969 --> 03:14:16.979 align:start position:0%
testimony which we will have a copy sent
 
03:14:18.370 --> 03:14:18.380 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
03:14:21.889 --> 03:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
so that you will see what he had to say
 
03:14:21.899 --> 03:14:23.389 align:start position:0%
so that you will see what he had to say
uh

03:14:23.389 --> 03:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:14:25.550 --> 03:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
I I don't think putting this out for
 
03:14:28.429 --> 03:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
years makes any sense as the as as the
 
03:14:30.410 --> 03:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
chairman indicated that this is just
 
03:14:32.170 --> 03:14:32.180 align:start position:0%
pushing it down the road
 
03:14:34.429 --> 03:14:34.439 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:14:37.490 --> 03:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
I'll let Kevin say his two cents and
 
03:14:43.309 --> 03:14:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:45.710 --> 03:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you judge Glenn I only have about
 
03:14:48.889 --> 03:14:48.899 align:start position:0%
two cents so I won't be too long
 
03:14:50.929 --> 03:14:50.939 align:start position:0%
um but before I
 
03:14:53.210 --> 03:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
say anything I just want to point out
 
03:14:55.030 --> 03:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
something that really hasn't been
 
03:14:57.889 --> 03:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
emphasized and that is that the
 
03:15:00.170 --> 03:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of malpractice
 
03:15:02.510 --> 03:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
cases get settled
 
03:15:05.570 --> 03:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
today and have for many years without a
 
03:15:08.690 --> 03:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
trial and without a panel hearing and
 
03:15:10.570 --> 03:15:10.580 align:start position:0%
that's why we don't use them because
 
03:15:14.510 --> 03:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
going through the panel system creates a
 
03:15:17.389 --> 03:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
delay and expense that we don't need to
 
03:15:18.790 --> 03:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
settle cases
 
03:15:21.889 --> 03:15:21.899 align:start position:0%
Dave God has been mentioned that 90 plus
 
03:15:23.870 --> 03:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
of malpractice cases get resolved I
 
03:15:25.370 --> 03:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
would say it's even substantially higher
 
03:15:27.950 --> 03:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
than that probably 95 percent and all
 
03:15:29.990 --> 03:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
that happens without a trial or a panel
 
03:15:33.410 --> 03:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
hearing uh thanks in large part to a
 
03:15:35.630 --> 03:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
Court rule that requires that all cases
 
03:15:39.290 --> 03:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
go to mediation at some point and when
 
03:15:40.969 --> 03:15:40.979 align:start position:0%
any case is filed one of the first
 
03:15:43.429 --> 03:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
things as Judge Lynn knows that happens
 
03:15:45.910 --> 03:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
is that the parties with the court
 
03:15:48.650 --> 03:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
develop a schedule for everything to
 
03:15:50.809 --> 03:15:50.819 align:start position:0%
occur starting with a trial date and
 
03:15:53.030 --> 03:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
then working backwards and one of the
 
03:15:56.150 --> 03:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
dates is a deadline by which you have to
 
03:15:58.370 --> 03:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
participate in alternative dispute
 
03:15:58.380 --> 03:15:59.690 align:start position:0%
participate in alternative dispute
resolution

03:15:59.690 --> 03:15:59.700 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
03:16:02.090 --> 03:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
the commonly known as mediations and
 
03:16:04.130 --> 03:16:04.140 align:start position:0%
that's where the vast majority of these
 
03:16:07.730 --> 03:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
cases get resolved so the end of the
 
03:16:09.769 --> 03:16:09.779 align:start position:0%
story is that's why no one's using this
 
03:16:11.630 --> 03:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
panel system is that cases are getting
 
03:16:14.269 --> 03:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
resolved without the expense and delay
 
03:16:16.610 --> 03:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
of going through a panel hearing which
 
03:16:18.469 --> 03:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
invariably use tens of thousands of
 
03:16:20.870 --> 03:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
dollars for both sides which just makes
 
03:16:25.849 --> 03:16:25.859 align:start position:0%
getting cases settled harder so
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
having done the end first
 
03:16:30.889 --> 03:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
um I have a long history with the whole
 
03:16:33.650 --> 03:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
panel process here having been on the
 
03:16:38.269 --> 03:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
very original study committee that spent
 
03:16:41.389 --> 03:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
many many many hours in this room 20
 
03:16:42.790 --> 03:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
03:16:45.830 --> 03:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
and we listened to many many hours of
 
03:16:47.630 --> 03:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
testimony from insurance company
 
03:16:50.450 --> 03:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
actuaries about how they set insurance
 
03:16:52.370 --> 03:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
rates which you can't imagine how
 
03:16:56.809 --> 03:16:56.819 align:start position:0%
painful that was Dr Gary Woods who was
 
03:17:00.110 --> 03:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
behind me in the back row also served on
 
03:17:03.110 --> 03:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
that commission 20 years ago and as well
 
03:17:06.170 --> 03:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
aware of how how much time was spent
 
03:17:08.030 --> 03:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:17:11.150 --> 03:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
panel systems including the main system
 
03:17:11.160 --> 03:17:12.590 align:start position:0%
panel systems including the main system
so

03:17:12.590 --> 03:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:15.650 --> 03:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
the majority recommendation of that
 
03:17:17.950 --> 03:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
commission was to adopt the main style
 
03:17:20.590 --> 03:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
panel screening system
 
03:17:24.349 --> 03:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
the minority authored a report which I
 
03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
brought copies of and I was going
 
03:17:28.190 --> 03:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
through my files the other day in
 
03:17:30.349 --> 03:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
anticipation of this these files are 20
 
03:17:31.370 --> 03:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
years old
 
03:17:33.469 --> 03:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
and and this is part of the Minority
 
03:17:35.710 --> 03:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
Report on that Commission
 
03:17:38.150 --> 03:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
Maine's mandatory pre-litigation
 
03:17:40.250 --> 03:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
screening Panel System went into effect
 
03:17:42.290 --> 03:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
in 1987.
 
03:17:45.170 --> 03:17:45.180 align:start position:0%
Ten Years Later the main Bureau of
 
03:17:47.210 --> 03:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioned an independent
 
03:17:49.010 --> 03:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
analysis of the effectiveness of the
 
03:17:50.809 --> 03:17:50.819 align:start position:0%
panel system
 
03:17:54.469 --> 03:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
by Ami risk Consultants they found that
 
03:17:57.349 --> 03:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
the average time between notice
 
03:18:01.130 --> 03:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
and the panel decision was 1.7 years
 
03:18:03.889 --> 03:18:03.899 align:start position:0%
the study concluded that the net effect
 
03:18:06.590 --> 03:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
of the panel system was an increased
 
03:18:09.950 --> 03:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
cost to insurers
 
03:18:12.410 --> 03:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
that was sounded very familiar to me
 
03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
when I read it and when I turned the
 
03:18:15.170 --> 03:18:15.180 align:start position:0%
page I realized this because I wrote
 
03:18:17.510 --> 03:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
that Minority Report 20 years ago
 
03:18:20.929 --> 03:18:20.939 align:start position:0%
but that's been our experience after all
 
03:18:22.490 --> 03:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
these years too that the panel system
 
03:18:24.469 --> 03:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
that we adopted although it differed
 
03:18:26.410 --> 03:18:26.420 align:start position:0%
somewhat from the main system
 
03:18:29.030 --> 03:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
Judge Lynn reported to the legislature
 
03:18:31.570 --> 03:18:31.580 align:start position:0%
some years ago on the number of cases
 
03:18:33.590 --> 03:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
filed and the number of cases going
 
03:18:35.570 --> 03:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
through the system and
 
03:18:35.580 --> 03:18:36.469 align:start position:0%
through the system and
um

03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:38.269 --> 03:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
it took about one and a half years to
 
03:18:40.610 --> 03:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
get a panel hearing these days you can
 
03:18:42.050 --> 03:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
get a trial within one and a half years
 
03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
and as I say most cases settle without a
 
03:18:46.790 --> 03:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
trial or a panel hearing so
 
03:18:50.090 --> 03:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
the need for it just isn't there
 
03:18:51.769 --> 03:18:51.779 align:start position:0%
one other point is that I think it's
 
03:18:55.309 --> 03:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:58.010 --> 03:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
why the whole Panel System the impetus
 
03:19:00.050 --> 03:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
behind the panel system and the first
 
03:19:02.870 --> 03:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
line of chapter 519 which was the
 
03:19:04.969 --> 03:19:04.979 align:start position:0%
screening panel bill
 
03:19:07.250 --> 03:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
says it all availability and
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
affordability of insurance against
 
03:19:11.090 --> 03:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
liability for medical injury is
 
03:19:11.100 --> 03:19:12.170 align:start position:0%
liability for medical injury is
essential

03:19:12.170 --> 03:19:12.180 align:start position:0%
essential
 
03:19:14.750 --> 03:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
this chapter affirms the intent of the
 
03:19:16.730 --> 03:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
general court to promote availability
 
03:19:19.910 --> 03:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
and affordability of insurance against
 
03:19:22.969 --> 03:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
viability for medical injury claims for
 
03:19:24.889 --> 03:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
medical injury should be resolved as
 
03:19:27.590 --> 03:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
early and inexpensively as possible
 
03:19:29.809 --> 03:19:29.819 align:start position:0%
so at the time we were having a
 
03:19:33.230 --> 03:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance crisis as was
 
03:19:35.690 --> 03:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
where most of the states which has
 
03:19:37.750 --> 03:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
happened periodically over the years
 
03:19:40.070 --> 03:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
that is not an issue anymore you haven't
 
03:19:41.690 --> 03:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
heard anyone complaining about the
 
03:19:44.690 --> 03:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
availability or affordability of medical
 
03:19:47.389 --> 03:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance in many years so
 
03:19:49.070 --> 03:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
even if the panel system we're working
 
03:19:51.710 --> 03:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
which it's not the original problem that
 
03:19:54.010 --> 03:19:54.020 align:start position:0%
it was supposed to address
 
03:19:57.610 --> 03:19:57.620 align:start position:0%
evaporated many years ago
 
03:20:00.050 --> 03:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
we think it makes sense to repeal it
 
03:20:02.510 --> 03:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
because it wastes Court resources
 
03:20:05.030 --> 03:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming number of cases settle
 
03:20:07.610 --> 03:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
without a panel hearing the impetus
 
03:20:10.250 --> 03:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
behind the panel hearing system has been
 
03:20:13.309 --> 03:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
resolved by both Market forces and other
 
03:20:15.830 --> 03:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
changes and to that point
 
03:20:15.840 --> 03:20:17.809 align:start position:0%
changes and to that point
um I

03:20:17.809 --> 03:20:17.819 align:start position:0%
um I
 
03:20:19.429 --> 03:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
thought it was interesting an article in
 
03:20:24.110 --> 03:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:24.120 --> 03:20:25.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:20:25.190 --> 03:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:27.469 --> 03:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
address the causes of
 
03:20:27.479 --> 03:20:28.370 align:start position:0%
address the causes of
um

03:20:28.370 --> 03:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:30.469 --> 03:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
insurance rates going down in part and
 
03:20:32.330 --> 03:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
they said that well they commented that
 
03:20:35.210 --> 03:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
the National Practitioner Data Bank as a
 
03:20:38.030 --> 03:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
National Organization to which every
 
03:20:39.590 --> 03:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice insurance payment
 
03:20:43.010 --> 03:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
has to be reported and the hospitals and
 
03:20:45.469 --> 03:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
medical societies have access to that
 
03:20:48.650 --> 03:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
and that data reveals a remarkable
 
03:20:51.290 --> 03:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
phenomenon the number of paid claims
 
03:20:54.050 --> 03:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
against Physicians has decreased by 75
 
03:20:57.170 --> 03:20:57.180 align:start position:0%
percent in the past 20 years
 
03:20:59.450 --> 03:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
reasons for the precipitous decline are
 
03:20:59.460 --> 03:21:01.070 align:start position:0%
reasons for the precipitous decline are
unclear

03:21:01.070 --> 03:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
unclear
 
03:21:03.590 --> 03:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the cause the sharp decrease in
 
03:21:06.110 --> 03:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice litigation has
 
03:21:08.630 --> 03:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
probably helped avert the kinds of
 
03:21:10.670 --> 03:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
instabilities that roiled medical
 
03:21:12.650 --> 03:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
liability insurance markets in the
 
03:21:15.769 --> 03:21:15.779 align:start position:0%
mid-1970s the mid-1980s and the early
 
03:21:20.330 --> 03:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
2000s the last of which is what um gave
 
03:21:22.010 --> 03:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
rise to the panel system here so in
 
03:21:22.020 --> 03:21:24.170 align:start position:0%
rise to the panel system here so in
short

03:21:24.170 --> 03:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
short
 
03:21:25.550 --> 03:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's not working
 
03:21:27.650 --> 03:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
people don't use it and it makes sense
 
03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
to take it off the books and happen to
 
03:21:31.550 --> 03:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
take any questions questions for these
 
03:21:31.560 --> 03:21:34.010 align:start position:0%
take any questions questions for these
Witnesses

03:21:34.010 --> 03:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
Witnesses
 
03:21:37.130 --> 03:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
yes representative Manos
 
03:21:43.849 --> 03:21:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:46.429 --> 03:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
s where you have a retired judge or
 
03:21:49.309 --> 03:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
somebody with judicial experience or
 
03:21:52.670 --> 03:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
um and a physician as composed as
 
03:21:54.710 --> 03:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
compared to mediation
 
03:21:57.710 --> 03:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
where you may be having a mediator who's
 
03:22:01.010 --> 03:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:01.020 --> 03:22:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:22:02.150 --> 03:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:04.309 --> 03:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
I've appeared before panels as a party
 
03:22:06.349 --> 03:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
and I've actually sat on panels as well
 
03:22:08.809 --> 03:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
as the lawyer member
 
03:22:08.819 --> 03:22:10.010 align:start position:0%
as the lawyer member
um

03:22:10.010 --> 03:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:12.530 --> 03:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
and in my experience they were very
 
03:22:15.730 --> 03:22:15.740 align:start position:0%
deliberate in considering the evidence
 
03:22:19.130 --> 03:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
and coming to a conclusion
 
03:22:19.140 --> 03:22:19.969 align:start position:0%
and coming to a conclusion
um

03:22:19.969 --> 03:22:19.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
so it's not that part of the process
 
03:22:23.510 --> 03:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
process that we had any issue with it's
 
03:22:26.090 --> 03:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
just that it's an expensive process that
 
03:22:27.710 --> 03:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
we don't need because most people have
 
03:22:30.889 --> 03:22:30.899 align:start position:0%
great success with good mediators and
 
03:22:32.690 --> 03:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
you know mediation is a voluntary
 
03:22:32.700 --> 03:22:33.950 align:start position:0%
you know mediation is a voluntary
process

03:22:33.950 --> 03:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:22:37.429 --> 03:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
and quite a bit of time is spent on the
 
03:22:39.410 --> 03:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
two sides agreeing on a mediator because
 
03:22:41.450 --> 03:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
not Everyone likes the same mediator and
 
03:22:44.030 --> 03:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
you know we always wind up with someone
 
03:22:45.710 --> 03:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
all parties can agree with and because
 
03:22:47.750 --> 03:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's a voluntary process
 
03:22:49.969 --> 03:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
with an agreed upon mediator I think
 
03:22:51.830 --> 03:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
that mediator has a lot more credibility
 
03:22:54.710 --> 03:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
because everyone's agreed on him and
 
03:22:56.210 --> 03:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:22:58.250 --> 03:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
good mediators in New Hampshire that do
 
03:23:00.290 --> 03:23:00.300 align:start position:0%
it full-time they're well known to the
 
03:23:03.290 --> 03:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
bar and they do a really really good job
 
03:23:05.570 --> 03:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
03:23:07.729 --> 03:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
are these Witnesses I should say um so
 
03:23:09.650 --> 03:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
you know can I just ask you one or both
 
03:23:13.790 --> 03:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
of you can you can you just explain for
 
03:23:16.010 --> 03:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
the members of the of the committee here
 
03:23:19.130 --> 03:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
in the under the main system
 
03:23:22.010 --> 03:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
is it I understand that it's you you do
 
03:23:24.889 --> 03:23:24.899 align:start position:0%
the panel before you bring suit but can
 
03:23:28.130 --> 03:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
if is there is there an opportunity
 
03:23:30.349 --> 03:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
under that system to waive them in there
 
03:23:32.389 --> 03:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
was it both the lawyer if the lawyers on
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
both sides say we don't want to do the
 
03:23:36.769 --> 03:23:36.779 align:start position:0%
panel can they still bring suit
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
I know you're did you want to answer
 
03:23:40.250 --> 03:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry I know years ago you
 
03:23:42.110 --> 03:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
could wave it I've had one main case and
 
03:23:43.490 --> 03:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
they waived it so I don't know what the
 
03:23:45.349 --> 03:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
current practice is
 
03:23:47.510 --> 03:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
um but with respect to
 
03:23:47.520 --> 03:23:49.570 align:start position:0%
um but with respect to
um

03:23:49.570 --> 03:23:49.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:53.450 --> 03:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
the order of the process in Maine you
 
03:23:54.769 --> 03:23:54.779 align:start position:0%
have to go through the panel process
 
03:23:57.650 --> 03:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
before you can even file a lawsuit and
 
03:23:59.510 --> 03:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
that was very thoroughly discussed in
 
03:24:02.330 --> 03:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
this room that summer of 2003 that we'll
 
03:24:05.630 --> 03:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
all remember and was uh considered and
 
03:24:07.250 --> 03:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
not included in the New Hampshire bill
 
03:24:10.429 --> 03:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
because it ran contrary to a Supreme
 
03:24:13.030 --> 03:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
Court case called Carson versus malware
 
03:24:16.969 --> 03:24:16.979 align:start position:0%
which threw out a statutory requirement
 
03:24:19.190 --> 03:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
to give priesthood notice and
 
03:24:21.050 --> 03:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
malpractice cases and it was a unanimous
 
03:24:23.630 --> 03:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
unanimous decision that's been followed
 
03:24:26.090 --> 03:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
for the many years since so that order
 
03:24:27.710 --> 03:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
of business as they do it in Maine was
 
03:24:29.450 --> 03:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
specifically not adopted in New
 
03:24:31.250 --> 03:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because the thought was that
 
03:24:32.630 --> 03:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
would not survive constitutional
 
03:24:32.640 --> 03:24:33.530 align:start position:0%
would not survive constitutional
challenge

03:24:33.530 --> 03:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
03:24:35.269 --> 03:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
right so I mean it strikes me though
 
03:24:37.010 --> 03:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
even if I mean even if you put that case
 
03:24:39.290 --> 03:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
aside if if it's
 
03:24:41.809 --> 03:24:41.819 align:start position:0%
if under the main system
 
03:24:44.690 --> 03:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
you can't both parties can agree to
 
03:24:47.330 --> 03:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
waive it and then go to truck go and go
 
03:24:48.290 --> 03:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
to court
 
03:24:50.450 --> 03:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
I guess you know to the extent it's been
 
03:24:52.670 --> 03:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
suggested we should adopt the main
 
03:24:55.790 --> 03:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
system even if we could what's the why
 
03:24:57.110 --> 03:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
is there any reason to believe that
 
03:24:58.729 --> 03:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
would make a difference I mean if why
 
03:25:01.250 --> 03:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't they waive it to the same
 
03:25:03.410 --> 03:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
extent they're waving it now just
 
03:25:05.570 --> 03:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
because it's before suit so what
 
03:25:07.490 --> 03:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
I don't I mean I don't understand that
 
03:25:08.990 --> 03:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody else that's going to
 
03:25:10.849 --> 03:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
testify against us can explain that but
 
03:25:12.590 --> 03:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
I don't quite see why that would make a
 
03:25:13.790 --> 03:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
difference I don't think it would I
 
03:25:15.229 --> 03:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
think the same result would obtain here
 
03:25:17.809 --> 03:25:17.819 align:start position:0%
and people who have experience with the
 
03:25:19.130 --> 03:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
panel system
 
03:25:21.050 --> 03:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
wave it because it's it's not working
 
03:25:23.570 --> 03:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
for either side
 
03:25:25.670 --> 03:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
all right other questions
 
03:25:28.309 --> 03:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you both very much
 
03:25:30.410 --> 03:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on Kimberly
 
03:25:30.420 --> 03:25:34.010 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on Kimberly
Kirkland

03:25:34.010 --> 03:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:34.020 --> 03:25:42.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:25:42.250 --> 03:25:42.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I too have a hard
 
03:25:47.510 --> 03:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
time not feeling like I should stand up
 
03:25:50.870 --> 03:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:53.269 --> 03:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for hearing my
 
03:25:55.370 --> 03:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is Kimberly Kirkland
 
03:25:59.290 --> 03:25:59.300 align:start position:0%
I'm a lawyer in Manchester I'm also the
 
03:26:01.729 --> 03:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
president-elect of the New Hampshire
 
03:26:05.210 --> 03:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
Association for justice but more
 
03:26:07.130 --> 03:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
pertinent I think to what I'm going to
 
03:26:11.450 --> 03:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
testify to here today is that from 2000
 
03:26:15.530 --> 03:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
to 2014 I was on the faculty of what was
 
03:26:18.349 --> 03:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
then Franklin Pierce Law Center now UNH
 
03:26:20.990 --> 03:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
Franklin Pierce school of law where I
 
03:26:23.330 --> 03:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
taught legal ethics and civil procedure
 
03:26:26.269 --> 03:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
and as a tenured member of The Faculty
 
03:26:27.650 --> 03:26:27.660 align:start position:0%
at the law school one of my
 
03:26:30.229 --> 03:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities was scholarship and I
 
03:26:33.710 --> 03:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
did empirical scholarship on the legal
 
03:26:33.720 --> 03:26:34.910 align:start position:0%
did empirical scholarship on the legal
profession

03:26:34.910 --> 03:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
profession
 
03:26:38.570 --> 03:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
so in looking at this issue I've tried
 
03:26:42.050 --> 03:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
to do that with the empirical scholar
 
03:26:45.889 --> 03:26:45.899 align:start position:0%
hat on and have dug into some of the
 
03:26:49.010 --> 03:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
data about the screening panels which
 
03:26:51.469 --> 03:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
may answer some of the questions that
 
03:26:52.610 --> 03:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
have been
 
03:26:52.620 --> 03:26:53.290 align:start position:0%
have been
um

03:26:53.290 --> 03:26:53.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:57.590 --> 03:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
posed so I what I'd like to do thinking
 
03:27:00.469 --> 03:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
that this is helpful to you would be to
 
03:27:02.690 --> 03:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
just run through some of the statistics
 
03:27:05.570 --> 03:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department that were
 
03:27:09.349 --> 03:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
gathered uh over the course of the life
 
03:27:12.370 --> 03:27:12.380 align:start position:0%
of panels from
 
03:27:14.469 --> 03:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
2007 through
 
03:27:18.229 --> 03:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
2020 or 18 was the last day that the
 
03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
insurance department was actually
 
03:27:23.690 --> 03:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
collecting data on how these panels were
 
03:27:27.050 --> 03:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
working and how it was impacting the
 
03:27:31.250 --> 03:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
resolution of cases as people have said
 
03:27:33.610 --> 03:27:33.620 align:start position:0%
before the intent was to reduce
 
03:27:37.130 --> 03:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance premiums to weed
 
03:27:39.710 --> 03:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
out frivolous claims to reduce defense
 
03:27:42.889 --> 03:27:42.899 align:start position:0%
costs and to review reduce the time to
 
03:27:42.899 --> 03:27:44.889 align:start position:0%
costs and to review reduce the time to
resolution

03:27:44.889 --> 03:27:44.899 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
03:27:48.710 --> 03:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
for a medical malpractice cases but the
 
03:27:52.309 --> 03:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
insurance department data for for
 
03:27:56.349 --> 03:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
instance 2000 in 12 to 2018
 
03:27:59.450 --> 03:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
indicates that if you look at cases
 
03:28:02.389 --> 03:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
where screening panels were waived so
 
03:28:03.969 --> 03:28:03.979 align:start position:0%
they weren't
 
03:28:03.979 --> 03:28:06.250 align:start position:0%
they weren't
initiated

03:28:06.250 --> 03:28:06.260 align:start position:0%
initiated
 
03:28:09.410 --> 03:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
93.4 percent of the cases settled
 
03:28:13.130 --> 03:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
pre-trial in cases or situations where
 
03:28:14.870 --> 03:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
the screening panel was in fact
 
03:28:14.880 --> 03:28:16.690 align:start position:0%
the screening panel was in fact
initiated

03:28:16.690 --> 03:28:16.700 align:start position:0%
initiated
 
03:28:20.929 --> 03:28:20.939 align:start position:0%
91.8 percent settled pre-trial so you
 
03:28:23.210 --> 03:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
had a higher rate of settlements when
 
03:28:27.290 --> 03:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
there was no screening panel initiated
 
03:28:27.300 --> 03:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
there was no screening panel initiated
um

03:28:28.070 --> 03:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:30.250 --> 03:28:30.260 align:start position:0%
according to
 
03:28:32.870 --> 03:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
the insurance department data the
 
03:28:35.210 --> 03:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
screening panels also slowed down
 
03:28:38.750 --> 03:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
resolution of the cases as some folks
 
03:28:43.070 --> 03:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
have already mentioned in 2018 over all
 
03:28:46.870 --> 03:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
types of cases the insurance department
 
03:28:50.210 --> 03:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
data suggested that for the last six
 
03:28:50.220 --> 03:28:52.030 align:start position:0%
data suggested that for the last six
years

03:28:52.030 --> 03:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:28:55.510 --> 03:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:28:59.809 --> 03:28:59.819 align:start position:0%
time to resolution increased if you had
 
03:29:02.870 --> 03:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
a screening panel to 28 months whereas
 
03:29:05.330 --> 03:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
if no screening panel was initiated it
 
03:29:08.389 --> 03:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
only took 24 months to resolve a medical
 
03:29:12.110 --> 03:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
malpractice case uh medical malpractice
 
03:29:16.309 --> 03:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
screening panels also increase the cost
 
03:29:19.610 --> 03:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
of resolution of these cases so in cases
 
03:29:23.110 --> 03:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
where the screening panels were waived
 
03:29:27.530 --> 03:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
24.5 percent of the money spent by the
 
03:29:30.429 --> 03:29:30.439 align:start position:0%
defense on these cases
 
03:29:35.210 --> 03:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
was attributable to or excuse me was
 
03:29:38.510 --> 03:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
attributable to Legal costs so the cost
 
03:29:42.530 --> 03:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
of paying lawyers experts the litigation
 
03:29:45.769 --> 03:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
costs where screening panels were
 
03:29:50.630 --> 03:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
initiated 35 of the total amounts paid
 
03:29:52.550 --> 03:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
by insurance companies for medical
 
03:29:56.630 --> 03:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
malpractice cases was attributed able to
 
03:30:00.830 --> 03:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
Legal costs so the amount of money going
 
03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
to lawyers and experts increased from 24
 
03:30:08.750 --> 03:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
to 35 percent in cases that went through
 
03:30:11.330 --> 03:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
a screening panel so it ends up being
 
03:30:15.290 --> 03:30:15.300 align:start position:0%
more expensive for the insurers
 
03:30:17.450 --> 03:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
um and a higher percentage of the Money
 
03:30:20.090 --> 03:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
Paid is actually paid to defense lawyers
 
03:30:23.809 --> 03:30:23.819 align:start position:0%
and experts and in general costs than
 
03:30:27.469 --> 03:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
gets paid in Indemnity payments to the
 
03:30:31.969 --> 03:30:31.979 align:start position:0%
actual patients who were injured there's
 
03:30:34.389 --> 03:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
also been some conversation about
 
03:30:37.429 --> 03:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice screening processes
 
03:30:39.550 --> 03:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
in other states
 
03:30:44.769 --> 03:30:44.779 align:start position:0%
the information that I have is that
 
03:30:51.229 --> 03:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
there are a total of uh 25 states where
 
03:30:55.130 --> 03:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
there is some screening panel process on
 
03:30:59.090 --> 03:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
the books but in 16 States like in New
 
03:31:01.190 --> 03:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire those panels aren't really
 
03:31:02.570 --> 03:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
being used
 
03:31:06.349 --> 03:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
so across the country the trend has been
 
03:31:09.349 --> 03:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
to initiate this panel system in the
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
hopes that it would reduce costs reduce
 
03:31:13.490 --> 03:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
time to resolution weed out frivolous
 
03:31:15.769 --> 03:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
claims people are finding it's not
 
03:31:18.889 --> 03:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
working and then
 
03:31:20.809 --> 03:31:20.819 align:start position:0%
um they're just staying on the books but
 
03:31:22.790 --> 03:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
not really being used the cases are
 
03:31:25.190 --> 03:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
being or the screening panels are being
 
03:31:28.190 --> 03:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
waived and in 2017 Kentucky actually
 
03:31:30.830 --> 03:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
repealed or actually there was a ruling
 
03:31:33.410 --> 03:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
that the screening panels were processed
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
was unconstitutional and Massachusetts
 
03:31:39.950 --> 03:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
in 2017 rescinded its screening panel
 
03:31:42.769 --> 03:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
process it left it on the books and said
 
03:31:45.250 --> 03:31:45.260 align:start position:0%
either side could unilaterally opt out
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
which you know is essentially uh what
 
03:31:51.309 --> 03:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
we're doing right now
 
03:31:56.269 --> 03:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
so in some I would just say I think the
 
03:31:59.269 --> 03:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
real problem with the panels is they're
 
03:32:02.269 --> 03:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
not working and as those who come before
 
03:32:06.889 --> 03:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
me have said it's in my experience now
 
03:32:09.050 --> 03:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
back in practice doing plaintiff's
 
03:32:12.290 --> 03:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice work I go into every
 
03:32:14.630 --> 03:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
single case saying we the plaintiff will
 
03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
wave the panel and so it's always up to
 
03:32:20.570 --> 03:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
the defense lawyer whether they want to
 
03:32:23.990 --> 03:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
waive or not I've been practicing doing
 
03:32:26.050 --> 03:32:26.060 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's medical malpractice work
 
03:32:29.750 --> 03:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
exclusively since 2014 and I have not
 
03:32:32.210 --> 03:32:32.220 align:start position:0%
had one screening panel they've been
 
03:32:35.750 --> 03:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
waived in every single case and I can
 
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
only imagine that the reason for that is
 
03:32:40.250 --> 03:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
that the insurance companies have found
 
03:32:42.830 --> 03:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
that they increase costs they increase
 
03:32:46.190 --> 03:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
time to resolution and that we the
 
03:32:48.590 --> 03:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's lawyers actually do the work
 
03:32:52.150 --> 03:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
of weeding out frivolous cases because
 
03:32:56.030 --> 03:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
we pay for experts and the costs of
 
03:32:56.040 --> 03:32:57.429 align:start position:0%
we pay for experts and the costs of
litigation

03:32:57.429 --> 03:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
03:33:00.710 --> 03:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
in these cases and we don't take them on
 
03:33:03.710 --> 03:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
unless we feel very confident that we
 
03:33:07.370 --> 03:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
have a meritorious case that will end up
 
03:33:10.010 --> 03:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
in a settlement for our clients
 
03:33:13.309 --> 03:33:13.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise we lose our shirts so we end
 
03:33:16.969 --> 03:33:16.979 align:start position:0%
up being the screen for frivolous cases
 
03:33:18.590 --> 03:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions questions
 
03:33:20.870 --> 03:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
for this Witness
 
03:33:22.729 --> 03:33:22.739 align:start position:0%

thank you chief justice Lynn and
 
03:33:37.130 --> 03:33:37.140 align:start position:0%

um I too feel like I should be standing
 
03:33:41.090 --> 03:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
in front of you
 
03:33:42.950 --> 03:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
03:33:45.410 --> 03:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak today I'm here in
 
03:33:46.790 --> 03:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
support of repealing the medical
 
03:33:49.610 --> 03:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
malpractice screening panel law my name
 
03:33:50.990 --> 03:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
is Holly Haines I'm an attorney at
 
03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
Abramson Brown and Dugan in Manchester
 
03:33:54.590 --> 03:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I practice exclusively
 
03:33:57.170 --> 03:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice on behalf of injured
 
03:33:59.570 --> 03:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
patients I've been doing this work for
 
03:34:01.969 --> 03:34:01.979 align:start position:0%
20 years and I can tell you I've been
 
03:34:04.910 --> 03:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
working on studying these medical
 
03:34:06.830 --> 03:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
malpractice screening panels since I
 
03:34:08.510 --> 03:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
started at this office one of my first
 
03:34:11.630 --> 03:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
assignments was to collect data and
 
03:34:13.790 --> 03:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
review data from Maine for Kevin Dugan
 
03:34:15.710 --> 03:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
my partner who spoke earlier who was on
 
03:34:18.050 --> 03:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
the study Commission
 
03:34:20.450 --> 03:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
um I also wrote an article with Kevin
 
03:34:22.250 --> 03:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
Dugan which I believe has been submitted
 
03:34:24.910 --> 03:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
to you we wrote that article in 2007
 
03:34:27.590 --> 03:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
anticipating expressing our concerns and
 
03:34:29.210 --> 03:34:29.220 align:start position:0%
predicting what may happen with the
 
03:34:30.650 --> 03:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
panel system in New Hampshire and
 
03:34:33.950 --> 03:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
analyzing the Massachusetts and main
 
03:34:35.750 --> 03:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
panel systems and the Constitutional
 
03:34:38.389 --> 03:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
concerns I will that should be
 
03:34:40.190 --> 03:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
considered my written testimony for this
 
03:34:42.590 --> 03:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
hearing and I will tell you that
 
03:34:44.809 --> 03:34:44.819 align:start position:0%
everything that we predicted in 2007 has
 
03:34:47.630 --> 03:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
been born out and it is laid out in that
 
03:34:49.550 --> 03:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
article in detail
 
03:34:53.210 --> 03:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
before I went into this field I did work
 
03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch as a law clerk
 
03:34:57.050 --> 03:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
for the superior court and for the
 
03:34:59.269 --> 03:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I'm also a past president
 
03:35:00.889 --> 03:35:00.899 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Association for
 
03:35:00.899 --> 03:35:01.910 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Association for
justice

03:35:01.910 --> 03:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
justice
 
03:35:04.250 --> 03:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
and as you've heard from many people
 
03:35:05.750 --> 03:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
already today from the legal Community
 
03:35:07.610 --> 03:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department and the
 
03:35:10.309 --> 03:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
judicial branch the
 
03:35:13.070 --> 03:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
screening panels just aren't working
 
03:35:15.950 --> 03:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
um I think every interested party gave
 
03:35:18.170 --> 03:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
this a really good effort in the first
 
03:35:19.729 --> 03:35:19.739 align:start position:0%
several years that the panels were
 
03:35:22.010 --> 03:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
enacted I served as a screening panel
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
member several times in the first five
 
03:35:26.750 --> 03:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
years they were in effect I tried cases
 
03:35:28.190 --> 03:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
to screening panels in the first five
 
03:35:30.349 --> 03:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
years they were in effect and I have
 
03:35:31.910 --> 03:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
been appointed as a screening panel
 
03:35:34.969 --> 03:35:34.979 align:start position:0%
member in recent years but after doing
 
03:35:36.769 --> 03:35:36.779 align:start position:0%
all of the work the panels were waived
 
03:35:38.510 --> 03:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
before they ever went to a hearing so I
 
03:35:40.490 --> 03:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
can attest to the amount of work that
 
03:35:43.010 --> 03:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
goes into these panels both trying them
 
03:35:45.830 --> 03:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
and as a panel member and
 
03:35:47.510 --> 03:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
as you can see from the statistics
 
03:35:49.550 --> 03:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
provided by the judicial branch
 
03:35:51.849 --> 03:35:51.859 align:start position:0%
there were numerous panels in the first
 
03:35:55.670 --> 03:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
five years in 2010 they precipitously
 
03:35:57.290 --> 03:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
dropped um
 
03:35:59.929 --> 03:35:59.939 align:start position:0%
and it's because after giving it a good
 
03:36:02.030 --> 03:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
faith effort everyone realized that they
 
03:36:04.130 --> 03:36:04.140 align:start position:0%
just don't work they cost more and they
 
03:36:07.070 --> 03:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
take more time than trying a case or
 
03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
moving forward with mandatory ADR in the
 
03:36:11.150 --> 03:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
court system
 
03:36:13.309 --> 03:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
it was the court system who initially
 
03:36:15.290 --> 03:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
brought this legislation because of the
 
03:36:17.150 --> 03:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
administrative burdens that it imposes
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
on them and they've been clear that it
 
03:36:21.050 --> 03:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
does not work or it has not been working
 
03:36:23.450 --> 03:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
the insurance department has confirmed
 
03:36:26.530 --> 03:36:26.540 align:start position:0%
that the panel statute has not
 
03:36:30.830 --> 03:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
achieved any of its intended purposes
 
03:36:32.870 --> 03:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
the legal Community from the defense bar
 
03:36:34.250 --> 03:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
I know there's at least one defense
 
03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
attorney here but there were no I
 
03:36:38.929 --> 03:36:38.939 align:start position:0%
thought it was noticeable absence at the
 
03:36:41.030 --> 03:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
Senate hearing that no defense attorneys
 
03:36:44.990 --> 03:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
spoke in opposition to this bill and
 
03:36:46.729 --> 03:36:46.739 align:start position:0%
there's limited attendance today in
 
03:36:49.550 --> 03:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
opposition to it and
 
03:36:51.469 --> 03:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
the defense attorneys who defend these
 
03:36:53.929 --> 03:36:53.939 align:start position:0%
cases are excellent lawyers very well
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
prepared but they know the costs that go
 
03:36:57.950 --> 03:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
into preparing these cases and they know
 
03:37:01.550 --> 03:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
the expense and they work on behalf of
 
03:37:02.990 --> 03:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
their clients the insurance companies
 
03:37:04.490 --> 03:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
who are the ones who have to pay those
 
03:37:07.010 --> 03:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
costs and I suspect that that is one of
 
03:37:09.229 --> 03:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
the reasons they may not be here in
 
03:37:09.239 --> 03:37:12.410 align:start position:0%
the reasons they may not be here in
droves

03:37:12.410 --> 03:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:14.150 --> 03:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
I was asked to come here today to talk
 
03:37:16.190 --> 03:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
about the Practical experience of the
 
03:37:18.530 --> 03:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
panels and just why there are
 
03:37:20.750 --> 03:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
already screening mechanisms in place
 
03:37:23.510 --> 03:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
not just the mandatory ADR in the court
 
03:37:27.769 --> 03:37:27.779 align:start position:0%
system but why our system itself screens
 
03:37:29.570 --> 03:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
out frivolous claims and there are not
 
03:37:33.530 --> 03:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:35.090 --> 03:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
the screening panel is supposed to
 
03:37:37.490 --> 03:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
screen out those claims
 
03:37:37.500 --> 03:37:40.250 align:start position:0%
screen out those claims
um

03:37:40.250 --> 03:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:42.229 --> 03:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
the reasons that this has not worked
 
03:37:44.450 --> 03:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
first and foremost the way the statute
 
03:37:45.950 --> 03:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
was written it could never be
 
03:37:47.330 --> 03:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
implemented and it hasn't been
 
03:37:49.490 --> 03:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
implemented as written because panels
 
03:37:52.010 --> 03:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
can't happen in the six months
 
03:37:53.929 --> 03:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
anticipated by the statute or even in
 
03:37:55.610 --> 03:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
the 11 months that's allowed by the
 
03:37:58.309 --> 03:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
statute it usually takes about a year
 
03:38:00.050 --> 03:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
03:38:00.060 --> 03:38:01.130 align:start position:0%
and a half
um

03:38:01.130 --> 03:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:03.469 --> 03:38:03.479 align:start position:0%
the numbers of cases have not
 
03:38:05.150 --> 03:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
substantially dropped since screening
 
03:38:07.490 --> 03:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
panels were enacted the panels aren't
 
03:38:09.590 --> 03:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
being used and
 
03:38:11.690 --> 03:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
Ben Gideon an attorney from Maine who
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
spoke at the Senate hearing explained
 
03:38:15.349 --> 03:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
that Maine's experience has been
 
03:38:18.349 --> 03:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
identical in Maine in fact it takes a
 
03:38:20.090 --> 03:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
year and a half to get through the panel
 
03:38:22.130 --> 03:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
process and it's prerequisite to filing
 
03:38:25.490 --> 03:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
suit so sue gets delayed by a year and a
 
03:38:26.809 --> 03:38:26.819 align:start position:0%
half they can't even start their jury
 
03:38:30.050 --> 03:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
trial process while we have a parallel
 
03:38:32.389 --> 03:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
claim intentionally so it doesn't delay
 
03:38:34.130 --> 03:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
the right to trial by jury which is a
 
03:38:35.630 --> 03:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
right guaranteed by our Constitution
 
03:38:38.210 --> 03:38:38.220 align:start position:0%
that was one of the major issues studied
 
03:38:42.349 --> 03:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:44.870 --> 03:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
so the original question of why there
 
03:38:46.370 --> 03:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
aren't more screening panels being heard
 
03:38:49.010 --> 03:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and why we have
 
03:38:51.349 --> 03:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
inherent screening mechanisms in our
 
03:38:53.630 --> 03:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
system versus plaintiff's lawyers work
 
03:38:56.210 --> 03:38:56.220 align:start position:0%
on a contingency fee basis that means we
 
03:38:58.610 --> 03:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
don't get paid unless we are successful
 
03:39:01.250 --> 03:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
in bringing a case for our clients
 
03:39:03.590 --> 03:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
we bear the costs of all of those claims
 
03:39:05.210 --> 03:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
and to bring a case to trial it often
 
03:39:07.729 --> 03:39:07.739 align:start position:0%
costs it is always tens of thousands of
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
dollars sometimes it is more than a
 
03:39:10.910 --> 03:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars just an expert
 
03:39:12.710 --> 03:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
witness costs and expenses to take a
 
03:39:15.229 --> 03:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
case to trial we don't bear those costs
 
03:39:17.090 --> 03:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
frivolously we aren't going to incur
 
03:39:19.070 --> 03:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
those costs in a case that we don't
 
03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
think is going to be successful that in
 
03:39:23.150 --> 03:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
itself is the first mechanism that
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
screens out frivolous cases and I
 
03:39:27.410 --> 03:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
believe at the original testimony in
 
03:39:30.469 --> 03:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
2005 when the statute was enacted Marty
 
03:39:32.210 --> 03:39:32.220 align:start position:0%
honigberg who represented the Medical
 
03:39:34.130 --> 03:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
Society at the time as their lobbyist
 
03:39:35.690 --> 03:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
and is now a superior court judge
 
03:39:37.969 --> 03:39:37.979 align:start position:0%
testified that there are no frivolous
 
03:39:39.950 --> 03:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
claims in New Hampshire
 
03:39:42.769 --> 03:39:42.779 align:start position:0%
the second is that we're required by
 
03:39:44.330 --> 03:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
Statute to support our medical
 
03:39:46.550 --> 03:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
malpractice cases with expert testimony
 
03:39:48.769 --> 03:39:48.779 align:start position:0%
we cannot file suit in good faith
 
03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
without having a board-certified medical
 
03:39:52.610 --> 03:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
expert who will support each element of
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
our claim those medical experts as you
 
03:39:56.269 --> 03:39:56.279 align:start position:0%
heard from others
 
03:39:58.670 --> 03:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
now some of the experts in the Harvard
 
03:40:00.650 --> 03:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
system and Johns Hopkins system are
 
03:40:02.929 --> 03:40:02.939 align:start position:0%
charging a thousand dollars an hour to
 
03:40:05.690 --> 03:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
review medical records and to testify it
 
03:40:07.250 --> 03:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
is very expensive to get a medical
 
03:40:10.969 --> 03:40:10.979 align:start position:0%
expert to review your case and that
 
03:40:13.070 --> 03:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
again is another screening mechanism
 
03:40:14.750 --> 03:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
that prevents people from bringing
 
03:40:16.670 --> 03:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
frivolous claims
 
03:40:19.309 --> 03:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
third if we bring a case a frivolous
 
03:40:21.170 --> 03:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
case and we take it to trial and we lose
 
03:40:23.450 --> 03:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
we are subject to paying the defense
 
03:40:26.090 --> 03:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
costs for that trial we've incurred a
 
03:40:27.410 --> 03:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars for going to
 
03:40:29.450 --> 03:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
trial the defense probably has less
 
03:40:30.769 --> 03:40:30.779 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the burden of
 
03:40:33.229 --> 03:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
proof but we may have to pay their 25 or
 
03:40:37.309 --> 03:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
50 000 in addition because we're subject
 
03:40:39.469 --> 03:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
to that that in itself is another
 
03:40:41.389 --> 03:40:41.399 align:start position:0%
screening mechanism inherent in the
 
03:40:43.010 --> 03:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
system that prevents plaintiff's lawyers
 
03:40:45.590 --> 03:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
from bringing frivolous claims
 
03:40:48.530 --> 03:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
and finally New Hampshire is a very very
 
03:40:51.590 --> 03:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
small state it's a small bar judges know
 
03:40:53.570 --> 03:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
you as chief justice Lynn can attest
 
03:40:55.910 --> 03:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
defense lawyers know you plaintiff's
 
03:40:57.950 --> 03:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
lawyers know the defense lawyers we work
 
03:41:00.170 --> 03:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
together it's such a small bar bringing
 
03:41:01.670 --> 03:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
these cases we have to work together
 
03:41:04.429 --> 03:41:04.439 align:start position:0%
every day and you lose credibility and
 
03:41:07.250 --> 03:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
you lose the trust of your colleagues if
 
03:41:08.570 --> 03:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
you're bringing frivolous claims and
 
03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's just something I don't think any
 
03:41:11.210 --> 03:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
of us would ever compromise our
 
03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
professional ethics by bringing a
 
03:41:14.889 --> 03:41:14.899 align:start position:0%
frivolous claim or our personal
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
the fifth is
 
03:41:26.090 --> 03:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
reason or inherent screening mechanism
 
03:41:28.490 --> 03:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
is the jury trial everyone in New
 
03:41:30.830 --> 03:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a right to a trial by jury
 
03:41:30.840 --> 03:41:32.030 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a right to a trial by jury
and

03:41:32.030 --> 03:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:34.429 --> 03:41:34.439 align:start position:0%
if a frivolous case somehow slips
 
03:41:36.290 --> 03:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
through the cracks a jury is going to
 
03:41:37.370 --> 03:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
see that and they're going to rule in
 
03:41:39.889 --> 03:41:39.899 align:start position:0%
the defense favor our jury system works
 
03:41:42.229 --> 03:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
I think anyone who has ever served on a
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
jury will tell you what works and
 
03:41:47.090 --> 03:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
um jurors consider these cases very
 
03:41:49.729 --> 03:41:49.739 align:start position:0%
carefully and no one would bring a
 
03:41:51.170 --> 03:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
frivolous claim
 
03:41:53.090 --> 03:41:53.100 align:start position:0%
all of these built-in screening
 
03:41:55.550 --> 03:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
mechanisms work
 
03:41:57.769 --> 03:41:57.779 align:start position:0%
and we don't need a screening panel and
 
03:41:59.690 --> 03:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
we don't need further study to address
 
03:41:59.700 --> 03:42:01.190 align:start position:0%
we don't need further study to address
this

03:42:01.190 --> 03:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:42:01.200 --> 03:42:01.969 align:start position:0%
this
um

03:42:01.969 --> 03:42:01.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
just a few facts from my own experiences
 
03:42:06.830 --> 03:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
I have not had a case go to a screening
 
03:42:08.990 --> 03:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
panel since 2010 so it's been more than
 
03:42:10.630 --> 03:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
13 years
 
03:42:13.370 --> 03:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
before that all of the cases that went
 
03:42:14.929 --> 03:42:14.939 align:start position:0%
to panel from our office were either
 
03:42:17.570 --> 03:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
three to O panel findings in our favor
 
03:42:19.550 --> 03:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
or two to one panel findings in our
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
favor and the one was always the medical
 
03:42:25.370 --> 03:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
member of the panel who often has a very
 
03:42:27.530 --> 03:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
hard time finding against a colleague in
 
03:42:29.150 --> 03:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
their profession it's a doctor that they
 
03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
work with professionally
 
03:42:34.010 --> 03:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
never once has the prospect or the
 
03:42:35.210 --> 03:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
occurrence of a screening panel
 
03:42:37.910 --> 03:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
dissuaded us from bringing a case or
 
03:42:39.650 --> 03:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
made me second guess bringing a case
 
03:42:42.290 --> 03:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
never once has the prospect or
 
03:42:43.729 --> 03:42:43.739 align:start position:0%
occurrence of a screening panel ever
 
03:42:46.010 --> 03:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
made me second guess the confidence that
 
03:42:47.450 --> 03:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
I have in my cases
 
03:42:47.460 --> 03:42:48.769 align:start position:0%
I have in my cases
and

03:42:48.769 --> 03:42:48.779 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:42:51.050 --> 03:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
never once have I had in my career a
 
03:42:52.370 --> 03:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
defense attorney say that there are
 
03:42:54.110 --> 03:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
frivolous cases being filed in New
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these are the people we work
 
03:42:58.969 --> 03:42:58.979 align:start position:0%
with every day and I just wanted to
 
03:43:00.590 --> 03:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
address a couple of the points that have
 
03:43:02.990 --> 03:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
been raised by Representatives already I
 
03:43:05.630 --> 03:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
believe it was um representative tur who
 
03:43:07.969 --> 03:43:07.979 align:start position:0%
asked if there it would be better if
 
03:43:09.889 --> 03:43:09.899 align:start position:0%
there was a voluntary screening panel as
 
03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
opposed to mandatory that imposes the
 
03:43:14.450 --> 03:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
administrative burdens on the courts
 
03:43:17.050 --> 03:43:17.060 align:start position:0%
I'd like to remind the committee that in
 
03:43:19.969 --> 03:43:19.979 align:start position:0%
2005 when this panel was this statute
 
03:43:21.410 --> 03:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
was enacted
 
03:43:25.070 --> 03:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature repealed RSA 519a which
 
03:43:27.170 --> 03:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
was a voluntary screening panel process
 
03:43:28.969 --> 03:43:28.979 align:start position:0%
for all professional negligence claims
 
03:43:31.550 --> 03:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
that's what it was that existed it was
 
03:43:34.190 --> 03:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
existing in the law it was repealed to
 
03:43:36.530 --> 03:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
make a mandatory process that now we
 
03:43:40.130 --> 03:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
know doesn't work so that was there it's
 
03:43:42.469 --> 03:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
been tried and it was the proponents of
 
03:43:44.630 --> 03:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
this legislation who eliminated the
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
voluntary process
 
03:43:47.040 --> 03:43:48.290 align:start position:0%
voluntary process
um

03:43:48.290 --> 03:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
a second thing that I believe my partner
 
03:43:52.250 --> 03:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
already addressed is the mandatory ADR
 
03:43:54.170 --> 03:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
it is mandatory in the court you cannot
 
03:43:56.150 --> 03:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
avoid going to either arbitration or
 
03:43:58.729 --> 03:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
mediation you cannot go to trial without
 
03:44:00.769 --> 03:44:00.779 align:start position:0%
attending ADR and giving a report to the
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
court and the judges will get on you if
 
03:44:05.389 --> 03:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
you haven't done it in a timely manner
 
03:44:07.130 --> 03:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
or by the deadline
 
03:44:09.349 --> 03:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
and finally I believe
 
03:44:11.750 --> 03:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
um representative Smith you asked what
 
03:44:14.150 --> 03:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
would happen if if this were just itl'd
 
03:44:17.809 --> 03:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
and allowed to continue as things are
 
03:44:19.490 --> 03:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's not going to do anything to
 
03:44:21.290 --> 03:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
relieve the administrative burdens on
 
03:44:23.570 --> 03:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
the court system when this was passed
 
03:44:24.889 --> 03:44:24.899 align:start position:0%
and this is addressed in the article
 
03:44:26.330 --> 03:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
that I submitted there was never a
 
03:44:27.889 --> 03:44:27.899 align:start position:0%
fiscal note no one ever gave the
 
03:44:29.809 --> 03:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
judicial branch additional funding to
 
03:44:32.750 --> 03:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
have these panels they devote one full
 
03:44:35.750 --> 03:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
Personnel to this whose
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sure whose Services could be better
 
03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
served doing other
 
03:44:42.290 --> 03:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
jobs for the Superior Court they also
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
have to devote in addition to having a
 
03:44:46.190 --> 03:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
retired judge or person with judicial
 
03:44:47.809 --> 03:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
experience they have to devote a
 
03:44:50.870 --> 03:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
courtroom a court security officer a
 
03:44:52.750 --> 03:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
court reporter
 
03:44:55.250 --> 03:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
electricity hearing I mean all of these
 
03:44:56.450 --> 03:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
things that are also administrative
 
03:44:58.250 --> 03:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
burdens they have to reserve all of that
 
03:45:00.050 --> 03:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
in the judicial branch that was never
 
03:45:02.450 --> 03:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
accounted for when this came in so it
 
03:45:04.070 --> 03:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
yelling this is going to leave the
 
03:45:05.809 --> 03:45:05.819 align:start position:0%
mandatory process in place that Court
 
03:45:07.550 --> 03:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
Personnel is going to have to continue
 
03:45:10.370 --> 03:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
working to and panel these panels that
 
03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't happen and try to find piano
 
03:45:15.170 --> 03:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
members I believe at the um
 
03:45:17.510 --> 03:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
Senate hearing the Richard head
 
03:45:20.450 --> 03:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
testified that often Angela Pearl the
 
03:45:22.729 --> 03:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
Superior Court panel coordinator is
 
03:45:25.490 --> 03:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
stuck Googling Physicians to try to find
 
03:45:26.990 --> 03:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
people in the Specialties because they
 
03:45:28.550 --> 03:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
don't have anyone who's voluntarily
 
03:45:30.530 --> 03:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
going to do it she is spending her days
 
03:45:33.170 --> 03:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
making phone calls trying to get panel
 
03:45:35.389 --> 03:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
members to serve on panels that are then
 
03:45:37.910 --> 03:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
waived and never happen that just can't
 
03:45:40.370 --> 03:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
be a good use of her time
 
03:45:43.070 --> 03:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
for our judicial branch and it's not a
 
03:45:44.809 --> 03:45:44.819 align:start position:0%
good use of any of the panel members
 
03:45:47.510 --> 03:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
time who get appointed and then the
 
03:45:49.849 --> 03:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
panel hearing is waived and with that
 
03:45:52.309 --> 03:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening and I'll take
 
03:45:54.050 --> 03:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
any questions questions for this witness
 
03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
yes representative Horrigan thank you
 
03:46:00.170 --> 03:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
very much both attorney Kirkland and we
 
03:46:03.110 --> 03:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
also had a memo that DJ Bettencourt the
 
03:46:04.790 --> 03:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Insurance
 
03:46:06.769 --> 03:46:06.779 align:start position:0%
um submitted to Senator Bradley back in
 
03:46:08.809 --> 03:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
the Senate process and they both
 
03:46:08.819 --> 03:46:10.670 align:start position:0%
the Senate process and they both
agreed

03:46:10.670 --> 03:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
03:46:12.650 --> 03:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
um his number he they both agree that
 
03:46:16.610 --> 03:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
the average is 28 months for uh well
 
03:46:19.250 --> 03:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
let's see exactly what 28 28 months for
 
03:46:22.729 --> 03:46:22.739 align:start position:0%
uh one with the screening and 24 for one
 
03:46:24.469 --> 03:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
where there is no screening panel but
 
03:46:28.190 --> 03:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
what's obviously an average means 50 in
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
averages and average what's the what are
 
03:46:33.110 --> 03:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
the lower and upper limits for how long
 
03:46:35.929 --> 03:46:35.939 align:start position:0%
these two processes take
 
03:46:37.969 --> 03:46:37.979 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I can answer that I
 
03:46:39.229 --> 03:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
think someone from the judicial branch
 
03:46:40.849 --> 03:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
would need to I can tell you my personal
 
03:46:43.670 --> 03:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
experience from our office
 
03:46:46.550 --> 03:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
um when panel hearings were held the
 
03:46:49.309 --> 03:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
panels were never held in under a year
 
03:46:51.950 --> 03:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
and because of the amount of discovery
 
03:46:54.050 --> 03:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
that was required for these what usually
 
03:46:56.210 --> 03:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
happened is with the parallel tracks
 
03:46:57.410 --> 03:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
everyone would agree to the same
 
03:46:59.809 --> 03:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
Discovery schedule for the panel and for
 
03:47:01.610 --> 03:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
the trial so you would go through the
 
03:47:03.410 --> 03:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
same Discovery process a year and a half
 
03:47:05.330 --> 03:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
to get to expert depositions and take
 
03:47:07.550 --> 03:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
all of the expert depositions and by
 
03:47:09.050 --> 03:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
that point the case is ready for trial
 
03:47:11.870 --> 03:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
so there's no need to have a panel
 
03:47:13.729 --> 03:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
um I'm not I don't think that answers
 
03:47:15.290 --> 03:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
your question but I don't know the
 
03:47:17.990 --> 03:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
statistics to properly answer that
 
03:47:18.000 --> 03:47:19.190 align:start position:0%
statistics to properly answer that
follow-up

03:47:19.190 --> 03:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:47:20.630 --> 03:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
um yes I've raised the question what is
 
03:47:22.130 --> 03:47:22.140 align:start position:0%
there any
 
03:47:24.530 --> 03:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
the bill before us we're going to just
 
03:47:25.969 --> 03:47:25.979 align:start position:0%
pull the plug on this whole process
 
03:47:28.250 --> 03:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
immediately which obviously you're in
 
03:47:29.750 --> 03:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
favor of in principle but there's any
 
03:47:32.630 --> 03:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
downside to the three panels that are
 
03:47:34.729 --> 03:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
already underway just immediately
 
03:47:37.190 --> 03:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
terminating their work with uh
 
03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
with like no is there any downside to
 
03:47:41.570 --> 03:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
that or you think that's probably a
 
03:47:44.150 --> 03:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
desirable outcome I don't
 
03:47:46.130 --> 03:47:46.140 align:start position:0%
know that there are any panels currently
 
03:47:48.110 --> 03:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
underway if there are three panels that
 
03:47:50.090 --> 03:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
have been in paneled
 
03:47:52.010 --> 03:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
um I I don't believe that they have
 
03:47:54.050 --> 03:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
heard anything and I suspect that they
 
03:47:55.610 --> 03:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
are likely to go the same way as panels
 
03:47:57.710 --> 03:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
that I've been appointed to once
 
03:47:59.450 --> 03:47:59.460 align:start position:0%
everyone reviews everything the panel
 
03:48:00.830 --> 03:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
will be waived and the hearing won't be
 
03:48:02.450 --> 03:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
held okay thank you thank you for
 
03:48:04.130 --> 03:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
clearing other questions for this one is
 
03:48:04.140 --> 03:48:07.190 align:start position:0%
clearing other questions for this one is
representative

03:48:07.190 --> 03:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:09.610 --> 03:48:09.620 align:start position:0%
have you find found that there's even
 
03:48:12.229 --> 03:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
Specialists available to be on these
 
03:48:13.910 --> 03:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
committees I would just question that
 
03:48:15.830 --> 03:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be you'd be able to find
 
03:48:17.389 --> 03:48:17.399 align:start position:0%
a doctor without a conflict of interest
 
03:48:19.429 --> 03:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
for example my husband is an
 
03:48:21.110 --> 03:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
Interventional cardiologist and I know
 
03:48:22.309 --> 03:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
03:48:24.469 --> 03:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
less than 30 of them licensed in New
 
03:48:26.210 --> 03:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
he knows pretty much all of them so are
 
03:48:29.279 --> 03:48:30.229 align:start position:0%
he knows pretty much all of them so are
these

03:48:30.229 --> 03:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:48:31.670 --> 03:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
people have you been able to actually
 
03:48:33.349 --> 03:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
find people on a panel that don't have a
 
03:48:35.630 --> 03:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest
 
03:48:38.510 --> 03:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
um we have made motions to strike panel
 
03:48:40.429 --> 03:48:40.439 align:start position:0%
members for conflicts of interest in the
 
03:48:42.710 --> 03:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
past in the very early years I don't
 
03:48:44.510 --> 03:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
work for the court system so I can't say
 
03:48:45.889 --> 03:48:45.899 align:start position:0%
that I believe that Richard had
 
03:48:48.110 --> 03:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
testified that that is one of the
 
03:48:50.990 --> 03:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
biggest hindrances and that's why Angela
 
03:48:53.090 --> 03:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
Pearl has taken has to do Google
 
03:48:54.710 --> 03:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
searches or search on the internet to
 
03:48:58.190 --> 03:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
try to find other Physicians but I am
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
not the appropriate person to answer
 
03:49:01.490 --> 03:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
that right but you've had a strike so it
 
03:49:04.910 --> 03:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
has been an issue in our mind at least I
 
03:49:06.530 --> 03:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
and I think it's very difficult and
 
03:49:08.090 --> 03:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
that's laid out in our article I believe
 
03:49:10.010 --> 03:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
that's been the experience in Maine as
 
03:49:11.389 --> 03:49:11.399 align:start position:0%
well that's one of the difficulties they
 
03:49:12.650 --> 03:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
have and why it takes a year and a half
 
03:49:14.929 --> 03:49:14.939 align:start position:0%
to get to panel hearings thank you other
 
03:49:16.910 --> 03:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
03:49:18.950 --> 03:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
03:49:21.050 --> 03:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
you chip dust next I'm going to call on
 
03:49:23.330 --> 03:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh Gary woods from the New Hampshire
 
03:49:34.330 --> 03:49:34.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:41.269 --> 03:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:43.370 --> 03:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
and actually just for reference I do
 
03:49:45.110 --> 03:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the amendment that we've
 
03:49:46.610 --> 03:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
been referencing
 
03:49:50.389 --> 03:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
um okay you have to yeah you need to I
 
03:49:52.610 --> 03:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
do have a copy for the record uh a copy
 
03:49:53.510 --> 03:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
of the amendment that we've been
 
03:49:54.830 --> 03:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
discussing that I'll that I'll share
 
03:49:54.840 --> 03:49:56.349 align:start position:0%
discussing that I'll that I'll share
okay

03:49:56.349 --> 03:49:56.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:49:59.690 --> 03:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
this is okay go ahead thank you Mr chair
 
03:50:01.550 --> 03:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
and committee uh my name for the record
 
03:50:03.889 --> 03:50:03.899 align:start position:0%
is Gary Woods um
 
03:50:05.630 --> 03:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm representing the medical society
 
03:50:09.050 --> 03:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired orthopedic surgeon
 
03:50:11.450 --> 03:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
um specialized in hand surgery and
 
03:50:14.210 --> 03:50:14.220 align:start position:0%
jokingly uh said I specialize just in I
 
03:50:15.410 --> 03:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
did the left hand
 
03:50:17.030 --> 03:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:50:19.250 --> 03:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
I you said the right hand is much too
 
03:50:20.690 --> 03:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
complicated at which point I was
 
03:50:24.349 --> 03:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
accosted by left-handers and said what I
 
03:50:28.490 --> 03:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
mean demeaning my left hand
 
03:50:28.500 --> 03:50:29.510 align:start position:0%
mean demeaning my left hand
um

03:50:29.510 --> 03:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:34.610 --> 03:50:34.620 align:start position:0%
I um as as noted previously I was on the
 
03:50:34.620 --> 03:50:35.690 align:start position:0%
I um as as noted previously I was on the
panel

03:50:35.690 --> 03:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
panel
 
03:50:39.469 --> 03:50:39.479 align:start position:0%
um uh to uh in 2005 that there was a
 
03:50:42.050 --> 03:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
formulation for the panel system
 
03:50:44.990 --> 03:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
um and indeed as anything touched by
 
03:50:47.389 --> 03:50:47.399 align:start position:0%
human hands is imperfect and I think
 
03:50:49.790 --> 03:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
what we've heard today is all those
 
03:50:49.800 --> 03:50:51.349 align:start position:0%
what we've heard today is all those
imperfections

03:50:51.349 --> 03:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
imperfections
 
03:50:52.969 --> 03:50:52.979 align:start position:0%
however contrary to what my daughter
 
03:50:55.130 --> 03:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
said when we had a flat tire she said
 
03:50:57.710 --> 03:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
why don't we just get a new car
 
03:51:00.769 --> 03:51:00.779 align:start position:0%
um I think what we're seeing here is the
 
03:51:03.469 --> 03:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that we would like to
 
03:51:03.479 --> 03:51:05.410 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that we would like to
see

03:51:05.410 --> 03:51:05.420 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:51:08.150 --> 03:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
in a good panel
 
03:51:11.710 --> 03:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
and with that in mind I am advocating
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
against the current bill as promulgated
 
03:51:17.990 --> 03:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
and amended by the Senate but by the
 
03:51:22.389 --> 03:51:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:26.349 --> 03:51:26.359 align:start position:0%
I have some sort of semi-random notes
 
03:51:30.050 --> 03:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
and I'll try and Skip through them why
 
03:51:34.610 --> 03:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
delay versus just repeal
 
03:51:36.889 --> 03:51:36.899 align:start position:0%
when looking at something that we were
 
03:51:38.990 --> 03:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get a study committee that we
 
03:51:42.290 --> 03:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
were advised that in fact uh that was
 
03:51:44.210 --> 03:51:44.220 align:start position:0%
any study committee was going to be
 
03:51:47.410 --> 03:51:47.420 align:start position:0%
looked on with a strong disfavor
 
03:51:50.330 --> 03:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
in the legislature this year because of
 
03:51:52.429 --> 03:51:52.439 align:start position:0%
uh activates and having been a
 
03:51:55.130 --> 03:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
legislator myself for two terms I can
 
03:51:58.550 --> 03:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
will agree that you can be overburdened
 
03:52:00.349 --> 03:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
rather rapidly
 
03:52:02.630 --> 03:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
but nevertheless having something on the
 
03:52:06.110 --> 03:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
books that in fact uh when you're going
 
03:52:08.269 --> 03:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
out and trying to get players to
 
03:52:10.670 --> 03:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
participate it's one thing just to do it
 
03:52:12.769 --> 03:52:12.779 align:start position:0%
on your own but if you can point to the
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that says we want to look at
 
03:52:15.950 --> 03:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
it because that's what that message
 
03:52:17.330 --> 03:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:52:19.070 --> 03:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
we want to look at it
 
03:52:21.170 --> 03:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
we think panel systems may have some
 
03:52:25.670 --> 03:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
Merit a current system has not worked in
 
03:52:29.210 --> 03:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
many dimensions as we've heard
 
03:52:33.530 --> 03:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
of cost administrative and so forth
 
03:52:35.929 --> 03:52:35.939 align:start position:0%
but those are all points that would be
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration to make it
 
03:52:38.040 --> 03:52:40.090 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration to make it
better

03:52:40.090 --> 03:52:40.100 align:start position:0%
better
 
03:52:43.070 --> 03:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
another point I'd like to just emphasize
 
03:52:47.750 --> 03:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
is that medicines changed since 2005 in
 
03:52:50.690 --> 03:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
case you hadn't noticed uh I think we
 
03:52:52.010 --> 03:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
all have
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
one of the things is I would just ask
 
03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
how many private practice doctors do you
 
03:52:59.510 --> 03:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
know just offhand
 
03:53:02.450 --> 03:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh everybody has to pause everybody's a
 
03:53:02.460 --> 03:53:03.469 align:start position:0%
uh everybody has to pause everybody's a
corporate

03:53:03.469 --> 03:53:03.479 align:start position:0%
corporate
 
03:53:07.729 --> 03:53:07.739 align:start position:0%
position they are owned by a corporation
 
03:53:10.790 --> 03:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of constraints playing
 
03:53:14.389 --> 03:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
placed on Physicians both economic as
 
03:53:16.130 --> 03:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
well as ethical
 
03:53:18.769 --> 03:53:18.779 align:start position:0%
and those come into play and I won't
 
03:53:21.170 --> 03:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
delve into all of them but that comes
 
03:53:24.650 --> 03:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
into play and May in fact be a measure
 
03:53:27.349 --> 03:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
of why we see so many settlements
 
03:53:27.359 --> 03:53:28.190 align:start position:0%
of why we see so many settlements
because

03:53:28.190 --> 03:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:53:32.330 --> 03:53:32.340 align:start position:0%
it used to be the the private physician
 
03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
feeling that he had you know something
 
03:53:35.570 --> 03:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
to defend
 
03:53:39.110 --> 03:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
would in fact work hard to to fend to
 
03:53:42.110 --> 03:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
defend himself but now
 
03:53:45.170 --> 03:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
and again I um I've
 
03:53:47.210 --> 03:53:47.220 align:start position:0%
the numbers say there's a lot of
 
03:53:47.220 --> 03:53:48.469 align:start position:0%
the numbers say there's a lot of
settlement

03:53:48.469 --> 03:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
03:53:51.410 --> 03:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
my contention may be that one factor not
 
03:53:55.130 --> 03:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
the factor but one factor is that
 
03:53:57.290 --> 03:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
corporations say it's easier to settle
 
03:53:59.590 --> 03:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
and it's less costly
 
03:54:03.110 --> 03:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
so let's settle and I don't have all the
 
03:54:03.120 --> 03:54:03.969 align:start position:0%
so let's settle and I don't have all the
numbers

03:54:03.969 --> 03:54:03.979 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
03:54:06.590 --> 03:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
and I'll hearken back to my previous
 
03:54:09.830 --> 03:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
profession as a physicist that I love
 
03:54:13.370 --> 03:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
numbers but you've got to remember it's
 
03:54:15.469 --> 03:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
not the numbers it's how you interpret
 
03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
the numbers
 
03:54:18.349 --> 03:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
that's important
 
03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
and I think as we go through this
 
03:54:20.399 --> 03:54:21.469 align:start position:0%
and I think as we go through this
process

03:54:21.469 --> 03:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:54:23.389 --> 03:54:23.399 align:start position:0%
and any committee that would look at it
 
03:54:26.030 --> 03:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
would have to look at the numbers and
 
03:54:27.530 --> 03:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
what they mean
 
03:54:30.229 --> 03:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay and when I say that I mean what
 
03:54:32.689 --> 03:54:32.699 align:start position:0%
what does though what do those numbers
 
03:54:32.699 --> 03:54:33.769 align:start position:0%
what does though what do those numbers
mean

03:54:33.769 --> 03:54:33.779 align:start position:0%
mean
 
03:54:37.370 --> 03:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
and at Harkins a Segway to another point
 
03:54:39.710 --> 03:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
and what does it mean
 
03:54:43.010 --> 03:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
I've yet to heard hear the word patient
 
03:54:43.020 --> 03:54:47.389 align:start position:0%
I've yet to heard hear the word patient
mission

03:54:47.389 --> 03:54:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:51.530 --> 03:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
this is basically we're talking about an
 
03:54:53.929 --> 03:54:53.939 align:start position:0%
act against a patient
 
03:54:56.450 --> 03:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
and a patient is trying to get
 
03:54:58.389 --> 03:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
some sort of
 
03:55:05.929 --> 03:55:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:08.689 --> 03:55:08.699 align:start position:0%
this panel system and all of our
 
03:55:12.950 --> 03:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
malpractice system is a mechanism to try
 
03:55:16.189 --> 03:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
and write that wrong
 
03:55:18.229 --> 03:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
in some way
 
03:55:20.269 --> 03:55:20.279 align:start position:0%
can't go back in time
 
03:55:22.790 --> 03:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
but there's a recognition
 
03:55:25.189 --> 03:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
and I think we have to keep that in mind
 
03:55:25.199 --> 03:55:26.389 align:start position:0%
and I think we have to keep that in mind
that

03:55:26.389 --> 03:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:55:28.130 --> 03:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
these efforts that we're going through
 
03:55:30.650 --> 03:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
now represent
 
03:55:32.630 --> 03:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
patient advocacy
 
03:55:34.849 --> 03:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
and again patient
 
03:55:36.769 --> 03:55:36.779 align:start position:0%
front and center what can we are we
 
03:55:38.750 --> 03:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing
 
03:55:40.610 --> 03:55:40.620 align:start position:0%
for the patient yeah we want to make it
 
03:55:43.189 --> 03:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
work for everybody
 
03:55:44.990 --> 03:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
for the judicial
 
03:55:46.790 --> 03:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
or the attorneys
 
03:55:48.530 --> 03:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
we want to we want to make it so it
 
03:55:50.750 --> 03:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
works for everyone
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
but we can't forget that the real reason
 
03:55:56.030 --> 03:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
is is
 
03:55:59.150 --> 03:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:02.809 --> 03:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
and all of medicine is predicated just
 
03:56:04.130 --> 03:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
on that
 
03:56:04.140 --> 03:56:05.650 align:start position:0%
on that
without

03:56:05.650 --> 03:56:05.660 align:start position:0%
without
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
I say
 
03:56:10.490 --> 03:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
the constraints of cost other than the
 
03:56:12.769 --> 03:56:12.779 align:start position:0%
corporations telling us we have to lower
 
03:56:12.779 --> 03:56:14.330 align:start position:0%
corporations telling us we have to lower
costs

03:56:14.330 --> 03:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:56:17.269 --> 03:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
and I'll give you an example
 
03:56:20.210 --> 03:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
that we look we look at patients and not
 
03:56:20.220 --> 03:56:21.889 align:start position:0%
that we look we look at patients and not
costs

03:56:21.889 --> 03:56:21.899 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:56:25.370 --> 03:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
if I if I were to ask you
 
03:56:27.769 --> 03:56:27.779 align:start position:0%
uh or I could tell you I could save you
 
03:56:34.189 --> 03:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:38.750 --> 03:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
immediately and long term well why not
 
03:56:40.910 --> 03:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
I say well
 
03:56:45.349 --> 03:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to advocate for no smoking
 
03:56:48.650 --> 03:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
okay one of the we shouldn't be
 
03:56:51.170 --> 03:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
advocating for no smoking
 
03:56:53.510 --> 03:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
because you die earlier
 
03:56:56.389 --> 03:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
okay you save money because you don't
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
you don't have a stroke you don't have
 
03:57:01.189 --> 03:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
an MI you don't have all these medical
 
03:57:03.469 --> 03:57:03.479 align:start position:0%
problems you don't go into a nursing
 
03:57:05.689 --> 03:57:05.699 align:start position:0%
home you don't have total joints
 
03:57:07.130 --> 03:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
so if you want to save Health Care
 
03:57:07.140 --> 03:57:08.750 align:start position:0%
so if you want to save Health Care
dollars

03:57:08.750 --> 03:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:57:11.570 --> 03:57:11.580 align:start position:0%
advocate for smoking
 
03:57:14.030 --> 03:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
now that's that's an absurd sort of
 
03:57:14.040 --> 03:57:16.309 align:start position:0%
now that's that's an absurd sort of
comparison

03:57:16.309 --> 03:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
03:57:19.189 --> 03:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
but our medicines is based on what we do
 
03:57:21.950 --> 03:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:24.650 --> 03:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
because it does come into play I'm not
 
03:57:26.929 --> 03:57:26.939 align:start position:0%
saying we shouldn't consider it
 
03:57:31.729 --> 03:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:35.090 --> 03:57:35.100 align:start position:0%
my next point is that review is good
 
03:57:35.100 --> 03:57:36.650 align:start position:0%
my next point is that review is good
even

03:57:36.650 --> 03:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
even
 
03:57:39.050 --> 03:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
when I was on the panel and as president
 
03:57:41.750 --> 03:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the medical society I'm sorry looking
 
03:57:44.210 --> 03:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
I'll try and be brief
 
03:57:44.220 --> 03:57:45.530 align:start position:0%
I'll try and be brief
um

03:57:45.530 --> 03:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:48.229 --> 03:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
um the the whole idea of
 
03:57:51.650 --> 03:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
that it's not perfect and we we knew
 
03:57:51.660 --> 03:57:52.670 align:start position:0%
that it's not perfect and we we knew
that

03:57:52.670 --> 03:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:57:54.590 --> 03:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
but the important thing is is to make it
 
03:57:56.330 --> 03:57:56.340 align:start position:0%
better because like we make our highways
 
03:57:58.849 --> 03:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
better and safer
 
03:58:01.610 --> 03:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
we should do the same here
 
03:58:03.469 --> 03:58:03.479 align:start position:0%
um just a quick comment about
 
03:58:03.479 --> 03:58:06.590 align:start position:0%
um just a quick comment about
settlements

03:58:06.590 --> 03:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:10.670 --> 03:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh it touches briefly and any group that
 
03:58:13.610 --> 03:58:13.620 align:start position:0%
would study this issue could study this
 
03:58:16.189 --> 03:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
as well or at least raise the issue
 
03:58:18.469 --> 03:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
because we want to be able to not miss
 
03:58:21.950 --> 03:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
take care of patients but also make sure
 
03:58:25.910 --> 03:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
we look at who in fact in fact there was
 
03:58:27.769 --> 03:58:27.779 align:start position:0%
some harm done
 
03:58:30.410 --> 03:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
is it properly being addressed
 
03:58:33.710 --> 03:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
and sometimes settlements
 
03:58:36.530 --> 03:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
any comments about whose right or wrong
 
03:58:38.090 --> 03:58:38.100 align:start position:0%
gets buried
 
03:58:40.510 --> 03:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
and that might not be in the patient's
 
03:58:44.450 --> 03:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:46.969 --> 03:58:46.979 align:start position:0%
without going into detail I can tell you
 
03:58:48.650 --> 03:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
that does occur
 
03:58:48.660 --> 03:58:50.030 align:start position:0%
that does occur
so

03:58:50.030 --> 03:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:50.040 --> 03:58:50.809 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:58:50.809 --> 03:58:50.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
having things out a little bit more in
 
03:58:56.030 --> 03:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
the open can be very much to everybody's
 
03:58:58.550 --> 03:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
been the Public's benefit
 
03:58:58.560 --> 03:59:00.710 align:start position:0%
been the Public's benefit
um

03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
I'll um I'll stop there questions
 
03:59:06.410 --> 03:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
03:59:08.630 --> 03:59:08.640 align:start position:0%

um so thank you Mr Jim you can tell us

who you are yes of course uh my name is
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
Mike padmore I'm the director of
 
03:59:18.229 --> 03:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
advocacy with the New Hampshire Medical
 
03:59:20.870 --> 03:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
Society uh and thank you Mr chairman or
 
03:59:22.189 --> 03:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
give me the time to speak and members of
 
03:59:25.070 --> 03:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
the committee um what I'd love to do is
 
03:59:26.809 --> 03:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
um I do have a written statement I'd
 
03:59:28.010 --> 03:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
like to touch on some of those different
 
03:59:31.070 --> 03:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
pieces I did share a couple copies of
 
03:59:33.530 --> 03:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
written testimony from Dr OG young and
 
03:59:35.510 --> 03:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
Dr Daniel Al bushes I would like to read
 
03:59:38.570 --> 03:59:38.580 align:start position:0%
a short excerpt we've you know given the
 
03:59:40.550 --> 03:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
time we've we've we've got it and you
 
03:59:42.830 --> 03:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
know we'll all read it so in fact I have
 
03:59:44.450 --> 03:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
already read it that's for both of them
 
03:59:46.790 --> 03:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's fair and I really would encourage
 
03:59:48.889 --> 03:59:48.899 align:start position:0%
folks to especially read Dr Daniel Al
 
03:59:51.349 --> 03:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
Bush's uh testimony where
 
03:59:55.610 --> 03:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
um she uh in 2013 did utilize this panel
 
03:59:55.620 --> 03:59:56.689 align:start position:0%
um she uh in 2013 did utilize this panel
process

03:59:56.689 --> 03:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:59:59.510 --> 03:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
um and I think that gives you uh some
 
04:00:01.729 --> 04:00:01.739 align:start position:0%
sense into the value of this process
 
04:00:03.349 --> 04:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
we're not saying that it's perfect I'm
 
04:00:04.849 --> 04:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
not I'm not going to sit here and say
 
04:00:07.309 --> 04:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
that this is a system that is operating
 
04:00:08.750 --> 04:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
the way that it should that it's
 
04:00:10.729 --> 04:00:10.739 align:start position:0%
operating efficiently and so when the
 
04:00:12.410 --> 04:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
when the judicial branch came to us and
 
04:00:16.189 --> 04:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
it was in October of 2022.
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
um we we discussed you know a potential
 
04:00:20.630 --> 04:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
repeal um you know we felt that having
 
04:00:22.309 --> 04:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to study it would be
 
04:00:24.590 --> 04:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
worthwhile and helpful to this process
 
04:00:26.450 --> 04:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
that was the bill that you know we
 
04:00:29.389 --> 04:00:29.399 align:start position:0%
testified on in January and it's
 
04:00:31.610 --> 04:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
obviously turned into this um and so
 
04:00:34.010 --> 04:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
what what our hope is and the amendment
 
04:00:35.929 --> 04:00:35.939 align:start position:0%
that I've shared with you all
 
04:00:38.090 --> 04:00:38.100 align:start position:0%
um not to rehash too much but it is a
 
04:00:40.849 --> 04:00:40.859 align:start position:0%
three-year pause it is a repeal it gives
 
04:00:43.189 --> 04:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
us the opportunity to continue to work
 
04:00:45.290 --> 04:00:45.300 align:start position:0%
on this existing statute representative
 
04:00:47.689 --> 04:00:47.699 align:start position:0%
Perez I know that you had given a
 
04:00:49.370 --> 04:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
question to Paula minahan around you
 
04:00:51.229 --> 04:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
know why not just repeal it and I think
 
04:00:54.530 --> 04:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
I do share the sentiment that Paula had
 
04:00:56.929 --> 04:00:56.939 align:start position:0%
around you know keeping that Statute in
 
04:00:58.670 --> 04:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
place it doesn't do any harm certainly
 
04:01:00.650 --> 04:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
if we are pausing this system and then
 
04:01:02.929 --> 04:01:02.939 align:start position:0%
repealing it after three years that's on
 
04:01:05.210 --> 04:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
us that's on me I recognized that in
 
04:01:07.010 --> 04:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
2005 the New Hampshire Medical Society
 
04:01:09.229 --> 04:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
where the proponents of this of this law
 
04:01:11.090 --> 04:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
and I recognize I wasn't part of the
 
04:01:12.710 --> 04:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
organization back then I was I think I
 
04:01:14.450 --> 04:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
was going into high school
 
04:01:16.250 --> 04:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
um so I recognized that there are some
 
04:01:18.410 --> 04:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
things that we have to own as part of
 
04:01:20.630 --> 04:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
our organization bringing this forward
 
04:01:22.130 --> 04:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
um and I'd like to be part of doing that
 
04:01:23.750 --> 04:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things that I want to
 
04:01:26.750 --> 04:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
focus on if you are to pass this bill as
 
04:01:28.550 --> 04:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
amended the amendment that I've shared
 
04:01:29.630 --> 04:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
with you all
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
we intend to organize the different
 
04:01:33.650 --> 04:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
stakeholders some of them that are in
 
04:01:35.630 --> 04:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
this room of course the defense folks
 
04:01:37.729 --> 04:01:37.739 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff folks
 
04:01:39.650 --> 04:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
um the folks working in malpractice
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
carriers the hospitals the Physicians
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
how can we identify a way to make this
 
04:01:47.570 --> 04:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
process work more efficiently I want to
 
04:01:48.889 --> 04:01:48.899 align:start position:0%
address something that representative
 
04:01:51.050 --> 04:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
churrer also brought up around you know
 
04:01:53.870 --> 04:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
potentially a you know an opt-in process
 
04:01:55.790 --> 04:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
and an attorney Haynes did address that
 
04:01:57.469 --> 04:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
and saying well that was something that
 
04:01:59.210 --> 04:01:59.220 align:start position:0%
essentially the medical society changed
 
04:02:01.429 --> 04:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
when we when we adopted this new law I'm
 
04:02:02.750 --> 04:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
here to tell you right now that we
 
04:02:04.250 --> 04:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily be opposed if we
 
04:02:05.990 --> 04:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
went back to that because I think what
 
04:02:08.330 --> 04:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
the issue here is is that there are
 
04:02:11.809 --> 04:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
opportunities or there there um there
 
04:02:14.450 --> 04:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
are occasions where you may have a
 
04:02:16.969 --> 04:02:16.979 align:start position:0%
physician like dockered al-bushies where
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
she feels that she did not deviate from
 
04:02:22.189 --> 04:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
the standard of care and feels that she
 
04:02:24.229 --> 04:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
would like to go to this panel and feels
 
04:02:25.490 --> 04:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
that that panel will give her an
 
04:02:28.550 --> 04:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to explain what happened in
 
04:02:31.010 --> 04:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
that case and so what I'm saying is is
 
04:02:34.490 --> 04:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
that I would like to find a way to make
 
04:02:37.130 --> 04:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
this process work for all parties and
 
04:02:38.630 --> 04:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
right now we understand that it isn't
 
04:02:40.790 --> 04:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
working for the judicial branch
 
04:02:43.250 --> 04:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
hear that you know to representative
 
04:02:44.809 --> 04:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
Smith's question around it yelling that
 
04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
quite honestly I don't we wouldn't
 
04:02:49.250 --> 04:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
support it just from the standpoint of
 
04:02:50.689 --> 04:02:50.699 align:start position:0%
we hear what the judicial branch is
 
04:02:52.309 --> 04:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
saying we we don't we don't think that
 
04:02:54.530 --> 04:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
makes sense we don't want to Advocate to
 
04:02:56.990 --> 04:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
keep a process in place that isn't
 
04:02:59.630 --> 04:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
working so that was our attempt through
 
04:03:01.250 --> 04:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
this compromise originally in the
 
04:03:03.290 --> 04:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
introduce Bill and then in this this
 
04:03:04.969 --> 04:03:04.979 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment that I've sent around
 
04:03:07.490 --> 04:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
to all of you right now to give us an
 
04:03:07.500 --> 04:03:08.630 align:start position:0%
to all of you right now to give us an
opportunity

04:03:08.630 --> 04:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:03:10.670 --> 04:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
um to to try to to address this and fix
 
04:03:12.530 --> 04:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
this so with that I'm happy to answer
 
04:03:14.570 --> 04:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
any questions questions for this Witness
 
04:03:16.729 --> 04:03:16.739 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much
 
04:03:22.090 --> 04:03:22.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.729 --> 04:03:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:27.530 --> 04:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
I know that you've been here a while so
 
04:03:29.090 --> 04:03:29.100 align:start position:0%
I'll try and be brief my name is Brad
 
04:03:31.309 --> 04:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
Holt I'm a partner at Solway and Hollis
 
04:03:33.050 --> 04:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
I've been defending medical malpractice
 
04:03:35.410 --> 04:03:35.420 align:start position:0%
cases since 1995.
 
04:03:38.290 --> 04:03:38.300 align:start position:0%
almost without exception
 
04:03:40.910 --> 04:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not here on behalf of any client I
 
04:03:43.969 --> 04:03:43.979 align:start position:0%
just think that this process uh has some
 
04:03:45.530 --> 04:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
value and so I'm giving you a defense
 
04:03:48.290 --> 04:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
lawyer's perspective on that as you do
 
04:03:49.969 --> 04:03:49.979 align:start position:0%
your legislative work and decide what to
 
04:03:55.130 --> 04:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
do I I oppose the ending of the panel
 
04:03:57.530 --> 04:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
process but I do recognize there are
 
04:03:59.090 --> 04:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
some areas that could be improved and
 
04:04:01.130 --> 04:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
there have been some good ideas uh today
 
04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
that I hope you'll consider as this goes
 
04:04:07.010 --> 04:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
forward it was uh I think an appropriate
 
04:04:10.030 --> 04:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
effort to try and
 
04:04:13.990 --> 04:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
short-circuit the expensive and
 
04:04:17.750 --> 04:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
stressful process Dr Woods referred to
 
04:04:19.630 --> 04:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
the to the patient or the plaintiff
 
04:04:22.490 --> 04:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
likewise for the physician it's a it's a
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
tough process it's expensive if there
 
04:04:27.229 --> 04:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
were a way to limit that that would be
 
04:04:29.330 --> 04:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
helpful both for reducing costs but also
 
04:04:32.929 --> 04:04:32.939 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of both parties and so
 
04:04:34.729 --> 04:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
this was a good effort to do it everyone
 
04:04:36.650 --> 04:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
says it's not working it's not working
 
04:04:38.750 --> 04:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
as designed but I guess we'd have to
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
Define not working because there are
 
04:04:44.269 --> 04:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
some aspects again that render this to
 
04:04:46.729 --> 04:04:46.739 align:start position:0%
be a good tool when it's used
 
04:04:49.309 --> 04:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
every tool is not useful for every
 
04:04:52.610 --> 04:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
project and so often cases resolve
 
04:04:52.620 --> 04:04:54.790 align:start position:0%
project and so often cases resolve
without

04:04:54.790 --> 04:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:04:57.830 --> 04:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
panels even without mediation by direct
 
04:04:59.929 --> 04:04:59.939 align:start position:0%
negotiation between the parties and
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes things have to go all the way
 
04:05:03.830 --> 04:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
to a jury to get resolved so this is
 
04:05:06.309 --> 04:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
just one of the ways that we can
 
04:05:09.229 --> 04:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
resolve cases and I think it should go
 
04:05:12.290 --> 04:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
forward if you'll consider some uh
 
04:05:15.290 --> 04:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
modifications to how it works it is true
 
04:05:17.990 --> 04:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
that they're pretty rare and I'll try
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
and identify a couple of reasons but my
 
04:05:22.189 --> 04:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
firm Solway and Hollis had one within
 
04:05:25.189 --> 04:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
the last year I haven't had any in
 
04:05:26.990 --> 04:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
several years but I did spend a few
 
04:05:29.349 --> 04:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
years in Chicago and a year on Military
 
04:05:32.750 --> 04:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
overseas but before that had some and
 
04:05:35.170 --> 04:05:35.180 align:start position:0%
again even even since its Inception
 
04:05:37.790 --> 04:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
often it would get waived and there are
 
04:05:39.830 --> 04:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
reasons for that
 
04:05:42.469 --> 04:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
two panel cases I had that had a 3-0
 
04:05:44.510 --> 04:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
unanimous finding for the defendant
 
04:05:47.809 --> 04:05:47.819 align:start position:0%
resulted in a resolution of that case
 
04:05:50.090 --> 04:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
without a settlement without a trial
 
04:05:52.309 --> 04:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
that was certainly
 
04:05:54.250 --> 04:05:54.260 align:start position:0%
terrific from my client's perspective
 
04:05:58.610 --> 04:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
and uh I had one in Maine I don't
 
04:06:00.650 --> 04:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
practice in Maine but I was there for a
 
04:06:02.750 --> 04:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
particular case and it was a 3-0
 
04:06:04.969 --> 04:06:04.979 align:start position:0%
unanimous finding in that case that
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
ended it all the litigation costs all
 
04:06:08.269 --> 04:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
the frustration
 
04:06:09.849 --> 04:06:09.859 align:start position:0%
for the parties
 
04:06:12.950 --> 04:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
but in cases that I've had for the panel
 
04:06:16.429 --> 04:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
response was a split verdict or
 
04:06:18.650 --> 04:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
unanimous for the plaintiff that that
 
04:06:21.469 --> 04:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
resulted in in settlement pretty quickly
 
04:06:23.469 --> 04:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
because uh it was
 
04:06:27.769 --> 04:06:27.779 align:start position:0%
persuasive on my client let me um let me
 
04:06:29.389 --> 04:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
address a couple of the points when I
 
04:06:30.290 --> 04:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
say it's
 
04:06:32.990 --> 04:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
have defined not working
 
04:06:36.110 --> 04:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
it was supposed to resolve cases early
 
04:06:38.570 --> 04:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
and I think everyone agrees
 
04:06:43.670 --> 04:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
um that part isn't working rarely maybe
 
04:06:46.969 --> 04:06:46.979 align:start position:0%
never has a case met the deadlines for
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
having a panel hearing and there are
 
04:06:50.990 --> 04:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
reasons for that as you heard some of my
 
04:06:52.790 --> 04:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
my colleagues on the plain side of
 
04:06:52.800 --> 04:06:53.950 align:start position:0%
my colleagues on the plain side of
things

04:06:53.950 --> 04:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
say medical malpractice cases are
 
04:06:59.889 --> 04:06:59.899 align:start position:0%
challenging uh the the good
 
04:07:02.150 --> 04:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
successful established plaintiffs
 
04:07:02.160 --> 04:07:03.410 align:start position:0%
successful established plaintiffs
lawyers

04:07:03.410 --> 04:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
lawyers
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
um and and hard work and defense lawyers
 
04:07:07.429 --> 04:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
know that they owe it to their clients
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
to work up a case sufficiently to be
 
04:07:12.110 --> 04:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
able to represent it well and and of
 
04:07:14.210 --> 04:07:14.220 align:start position:0%
course that's expensive but also it
 
04:07:15.830 --> 04:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
means you wouldn't want to go into a
 
04:07:17.570 --> 04:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
panel hearing without having certain
 
04:07:20.809 --> 04:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
amount of of uh discovery which is where
 
04:07:22.309 --> 04:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
we gather information that the other
 
04:07:24.830 --> 04:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
side or we want to put into a future
 
04:07:27.110 --> 04:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
trial so it's true they don't go early
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
so what that that in itself
 
04:07:32.570 --> 04:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't add a cost
 
04:07:36.170 --> 04:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
if if you can establish that
 
04:07:38.689 --> 04:07:38.699 align:start position:0%
panel happening later in this whole
 
04:07:41.450 --> 04:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
litigation process adds a cost that
 
04:07:42.950 --> 04:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
might be different but I don't think it
 
04:07:45.530 --> 04:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
does so just being outside the normal
 
04:07:48.170 --> 04:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
time parameters isn't a concern and it's
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
often waived so what if it's waived
 
04:07:53.570 --> 04:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
that's no cost either because we didn't
 
04:07:55.790 --> 04:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
have to use a courtroom or Court staff
 
04:07:57.769 --> 04:07:57.779 align:start position:0%
or electricity or if it isn't the
 
04:07:59.450 --> 04:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
problem that the that the judicial
 
04:08:01.429 --> 04:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
branch has to they don't know it's going
 
04:08:04.729 --> 04:08:04.739 align:start position:0%
to be waived your honor of chairman I'll
 
04:08:06.290 --> 04:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
address that at the end I think that's
 
04:08:10.010 --> 04:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
true if if so that the problem is when a
 
04:08:12.530 --> 04:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
panel is requested because it isn't
 
04:08:14.750 --> 04:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
waived by both parties it's been very
 
04:08:16.610 --> 04:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
difficult to schedule for reasons stated
 
04:08:18.170 --> 04:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
you've got multiple people that have to
 
04:08:20.229 --> 04:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
get their calendars together there are
 
04:08:23.689 --> 04:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
challenges with conflicts of interest
 
04:08:27.469 --> 04:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
and and finding members to create a
 
04:08:29.510 --> 04:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
panel so that Court strain is a problem
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's a problem the whole panel process
 
04:08:34.610 --> 04:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
when not used isn't necessarily a
 
04:08:36.530 --> 04:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
problem but if it's used and it puts an
 
04:08:37.910 --> 04:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
undue restraint
 
04:08:41.090 --> 04:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
constraint on the the Personnel of the
 
04:08:43.790 --> 04:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
Court that's a problem I would say that
 
04:08:46.370 --> 04:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
sometimes that difficulty in scheduling
 
04:08:50.269 --> 04:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
and and paneling three qualified people
 
04:08:52.849 --> 04:08:52.859 align:start position:0%
often ends up being the reason that
 
04:08:54.410 --> 04:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
there's a waiver we see that it's just
 
04:08:56.809 --> 04:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
not happening and so we agree to move on
 
04:08:59.570 --> 04:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
from the defense side of things so that
 
04:09:01.130 --> 04:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
piece of the problem could be addressed
 
04:09:03.769 --> 04:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
with some modifications without chucking
 
04:09:05.809 --> 04:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
the whole panel process because as I say
 
04:09:08.510 --> 04:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's valuable
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
um it's valuable when the 3-0 a
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
unanimous finding for a defendant
 
04:09:17.570 --> 04:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
leads a plaintiff to drop the case all
 
04:09:20.150 --> 04:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
those litigation costs that would go
 
04:09:22.010 --> 04:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
after that that involve preparing for
 
04:09:23.929 --> 04:09:23.939 align:start position:0%
trial are gone all the court resources
 
04:09:26.389 --> 04:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
and again all the stress on on the
 
04:09:29.389 --> 04:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
parties and when a plaintiff wins or
 
04:09:31.309 --> 04:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
there's a split verdict and particularly
 
04:09:35.570 --> 04:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
where the physician panelist
 
04:09:37.729 --> 04:09:37.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't support a doctor that's quite
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
compelling to my clients and it really
 
04:09:41.570 --> 04:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
invites them to think more strongly
 
04:09:44.150 --> 04:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
about settlement so if there are cases
 
04:09:47.689 --> 04:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
where the doctor on the panel is is the
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
one that won't go with the plaintiff's
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
case I haven't had that and I've had it
 
04:09:53.510 --> 04:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
where the doctor agreed with the
 
04:09:55.010 --> 04:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
plaintiff and then that was compelling
 
04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
and so it can be useful to bring your
 
04:10:00.410 --> 04:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
your client to to a proper settlement
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
the idea that there are two tracks I
 
04:10:06.290 --> 04:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
would also oppose that as you heard from
 
04:10:09.530 --> 04:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
uh I think Kevin Dugan indicated that
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
the first thing is the trial date and
 
04:10:12.469 --> 04:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
then you move back with all the other
 
04:10:14.510 --> 04:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
pieces of it
 
04:10:16.849 --> 04:10:16.859 align:start position:0%
discover and likewise you heard I think
 
04:10:19.370 --> 04:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
from Ms Haynes that uh
 
04:10:23.450 --> 04:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
all this discovery has to happen before
 
04:10:25.490 --> 04:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
a panel is going to be worthwhile before
 
04:10:26.929 --> 04:10:26.939 align:start position:0%
people really know what they're talking
 
04:10:30.229 --> 04:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
about so there's really One schedule
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
one track and a panel when impaneled
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
is a step along the way and if it's
 
04:10:38.929 --> 04:10:38.939 align:start position:0%
waived then the the process continues
 
04:10:41.570 --> 04:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
but it's not like trial panel
 
04:10:43.429 --> 04:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
preparation is entirely separate from
 
04:10:45.530 --> 04:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
trial preparation you're doing paper
 
04:10:49.250 --> 04:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
Discovery your disclosing experts your
 
04:10:51.769 --> 04:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
deposing parties deposing Witnesses
 
04:10:54.290 --> 04:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
deposing experts to prepare for trial
 
04:10:57.170 --> 04:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
and typically a panel will happen after
 
04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
enough important information but not to
 
04:11:02.150 --> 04:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
the nth degree that a trial is going to
 
04:11:04.849 --> 04:11:04.859 align:start position:0%
required has been completed so I think
 
04:11:07.550 --> 04:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's one pan one track the panel process
 
04:11:09.710 --> 04:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
fits at an apt spot where experience
 
04:11:12.290 --> 04:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
Council try and fit it when they've got
 
04:11:14.330 --> 04:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
enough information but they can avoid
 
04:11:18.170 --> 04:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
that last that last mile to to a verdict
 
04:11:21.170 --> 04:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
is what's incredibly expensive and and
 
04:11:21.180 --> 04:11:22.490 align:start position:0%
is what's incredibly expensive and and
challenging

04:11:22.490 --> 04:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
challenging
 
04:11:26.090 --> 04:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
so uh a note that a panel is typically a
 
04:11:28.370 --> 04:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
day sometimes even half a day most Med
 
04:11:31.130 --> 04:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
mail cases are at least a week typically
 
04:11:33.170 --> 04:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
into another week or even three weeks
 
04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
and so if a panel is going to be
 
04:11:39.290 --> 04:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
potentially efficacious the possibility
 
04:11:41.210 --> 04:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
of savings is huge because every day in
 
04:11:43.790 --> 04:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
court and preparation for it is is
 
04:11:46.490 --> 04:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily expensive likewise not
 
04:11:49.030 --> 04:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
every witness including every expensive
 
04:11:51.590 --> 04:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
expert that is going to come to trial is
 
04:11:53.210 --> 04:11:53.220 align:start position:0%
brought to a panel if they've been
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
deposed their transcripts are are
 
04:11:58.550 --> 04:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
admissible because the panel process is
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
not really a full mini trial The Rules
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
of Evidence are more lenient and so
 
04:12:05.389 --> 04:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
there are some streamlined ways to put
 
04:12:07.309 --> 04:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
in what would be evidence at trial
 
04:12:09.769 --> 04:12:09.779 align:start position:0%
without bringing all the witnesses for
 
04:12:13.250 --> 04:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
it so I'll conclude by saying
 
04:12:15.590 --> 04:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
there are sometimes it's valuable
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's waived because it isn't
 
04:12:20.269 --> 04:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
necessary the parties can directly
 
04:12:23.210 --> 04:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
negotiate and experience council do that
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
pretty often sometimes it's through
 
04:12:27.530 --> 04:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
mediation mediation is different than a
 
04:12:27.540 --> 04:12:28.429 align:start position:0%
mediation mediation is different than a
panel

04:12:28.429 --> 04:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
panel
 
04:12:30.889 --> 04:12:30.899 align:start position:0%
I ordered the question about
 
04:12:30.899 --> 04:12:31.849 align:start position:0%
I ordered the question about
um

04:12:31.849 --> 04:12:31.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:35.389 --> 04:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
a a plaintiff I think needs their day in
 
04:12:36.530 --> 04:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
court they need to know they've been
 
04:12:37.969 --> 04:12:37.979 align:start position:0%
heard and that mediation process
 
04:12:39.650 --> 04:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
typically doesn't provide that it's
 
04:12:41.630 --> 04:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
often lawyers and mediators getting it
 
04:12:44.090 --> 04:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
done especially in this era of zoom and
 
04:12:45.769 --> 04:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
I think there is some value of going to
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
a panel and both parties sitting across
 
04:12:50.229 --> 04:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
the room hearing from the other side
 
04:12:52.670 --> 04:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
seeing their their resolve seeing the
 
04:12:55.370 --> 04:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
points they make that that can be an
 
04:12:57.050 --> 04:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
important part of then getting someone
 
04:12:59.450 --> 04:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
ready to reach a settlement so sometimes
 
04:13:01.490 --> 04:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
the data is hard to read I guess as Dr
 
04:13:02.929 --> 04:13:02.939 align:start position:0%
Wood said there was some interesting
 
04:13:05.210 --> 04:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
data from Ms Haynes and Miss Kirkland
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
but it would be hard to decipher what
 
04:13:11.929 --> 04:13:11.939 align:start position:0%
led to settlement and the timing of it
 
04:13:13.849 --> 04:13:13.859 align:start position:0%
so just looking at those raw numbers
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily tell the story the
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
timing of of settlement often is
 
04:13:20.450 --> 04:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes cases go to mediation and
 
04:13:22.130 --> 04:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
don't settle until after that people
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
have time to process it and then come
 
04:13:26.469 --> 04:13:26.479 align:start position:0%
back together and resolve it so
 
04:13:28.849 --> 04:13:28.859 align:start position:0%
recommendations would be that you'd have
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
a period of time to make some
 
04:13:32.269 --> 04:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
modifications there was a point about
 
04:13:35.269 --> 04:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
compensating panelists only the Justice
 
04:13:37.610 --> 04:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
the retired Justice that chairs the
 
04:13:40.130 --> 04:13:40.140 align:start position:0%
panel gets paid and I I don't remember
 
04:13:42.290 --> 04:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
the amount I'm sure it's
 
04:13:45.229 --> 04:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
not a lot but the the Physicians that
 
04:13:47.269 --> 04:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
take a day off of work you know a day
 
04:13:49.849 --> 04:13:49.859 align:start position:0%
off of surgery uh that's a that's a big
 
04:13:52.429 --> 04:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
ask so there may be a way to to
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
compensate panelists and that might make
 
04:13:56.630 --> 04:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
the pool of panelists more readily
 
04:13:58.670 --> 04:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
available so that that impediment to
 
04:14:00.410 --> 04:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
panels of
 
04:14:02.210 --> 04:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
just a challenge of getting them
 
04:14:06.229 --> 04:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
together would be reduced uh likewise a
 
04:14:07.969 --> 04:14:07.979 align:start position:0%
stronger encouragement for people to
 
04:14:09.229 --> 04:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
participate I think it was
 
04:14:11.330 --> 04:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative kutab's suggestion that
 
04:14:14.090 --> 04:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
the hospitals have some incentive to say
 
04:14:16.010 --> 04:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
please serve on one a year but that kind
 
04:14:19.490 --> 04:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
of mechanism to ensure that it's part of
 
04:14:21.590 --> 04:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
your your professional responsibility to
 
04:14:23.689 --> 04:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
participate in panels would be helpful
 
04:14:26.150 --> 04:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
third just modifying the timing
 
04:14:27.950 --> 04:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
expectation I think this is a big one
 
04:14:31.130 --> 04:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:33.710 --> 04:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
as soon as a case is filed and there's
 
04:14:35.750 --> 04:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
an effort to identify who the panel
 
04:14:37.729 --> 04:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
chair would be the judge or the retired
 
04:14:41.809 --> 04:14:41.819 align:start position:0%
the retired judge chairman chairperson
 
04:14:43.849 --> 04:14:43.859 align:start position:0%
the whole process doesn't get started
 
04:14:46.490 --> 04:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
and that could be you could hold off on
 
04:14:48.229 --> 04:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
that until a time something like the
 
04:14:51.110 --> 04:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
opt-in idea before you really impaneled
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
the group before you started preparing
 
04:14:54.830 --> 04:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
materials for it because we know it's
 
04:14:56.450 --> 04:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
not going to happen for a while so truly
 
04:14:58.610 --> 04:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
from the day it starts for that that
 
04:15:01.370 --> 04:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
first six months or 11 months or often
 
04:15:03.650 --> 04:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
longer there's nothing for the panel to
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
do that's not where the timing happens
 
04:15:08.210 --> 04:15:08.220 align:start position:0%
it's only when they're coming in for a
 
04:15:10.910 --> 04:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
landing but modify that expectation
 
04:15:14.150 --> 04:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
forget the sixth month and 11 month uh
 
04:15:16.010 --> 04:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
deadlines that are in the statute but
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
which can be waived for good cause and
 
04:15:21.710 --> 04:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
always are and then finally
 
04:15:21.720 --> 04:15:22.790 align:start position:0%
always are and then finally
um

04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:24.650 --> 04:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
uh just to ensure that there's a
 
04:15:26.570 --> 04:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
commitment you could modify the way the
 
04:15:29.150 --> 04:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
impalement process occurs so that there
 
04:15:31.969 --> 04:15:31.979 align:start position:0%
isn't any kind of false start cost
 
04:15:34.250 --> 04:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
whereby panels were waived at the 11th
 
04:15:36.590 --> 04:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
hour I suppose if they're waived at the
 
04:15:39.349 --> 04:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
11th hour because a case settled
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
with an impending panel
 
04:15:43.849 --> 04:15:43.859 align:start position:0%
maybe the panel had some effect on that
 
04:15:45.830 --> 04:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
without actually going forward so that's
 
04:15:47.510 --> 04:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
why I say it's difficult to determine
 
04:15:50.150 --> 04:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
what causes and effects are but
 
04:15:52.550 --> 04:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
experience Counsel on both sides of the
 
04:15:55.550 --> 04:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
aisle are are usually able to suss out
 
04:15:57.530 --> 04:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
whether it's valuable to go to a panel
 
04:15:58.790 --> 04:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
or not
 
04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
and so this is a tool that's worth
 
04:16:04.070 --> 04:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
keeping on the tool bench it doesn't get
 
04:16:05.450 --> 04:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
used all the time but sometimes it's
 
04:16:05.460 --> 04:16:07.010 align:start position:0%
used all the time but sometimes it's
effective

04:16:07.010 --> 04:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
effective
 
04:16:09.050 --> 04:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
04:16:11.389 --> 04:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
so Michelle I guess I one of the things
 
04:16:14.450 --> 04:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
that that I'm not sure that I heard you
 
04:16:16.729 --> 04:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
say or really any of the other Witnesses
 
04:16:18.830 --> 04:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
who sort of oppose this and this is a
 
04:16:20.510 --> 04:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
thing that's a great concern to me you
 
04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
say and I think you're probably right
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
that there are some occasions
 
04:16:27.710 --> 04:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
when the panel is useful
 
04:16:30.410 --> 04:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like most of the time and
 
04:16:32.510 --> 04:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
from the numbers that's certainly
 
04:16:34.670 --> 04:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
you know seems to bear this out that
 
04:16:37.070 --> 04:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
most of the time the lawyers on both
 
04:16:39.650 --> 04:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
sides agreed to waive it and so they
 
04:16:42.170 --> 04:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
find that it's not useful and so I guess
 
04:16:46.570 --> 04:16:46.580 align:start position:0%
the thing I really have a my concern is
 
04:16:50.929 --> 04:16:50.939 align:start position:0%
we we the panel system creates an
 
04:16:52.969 --> 04:16:52.979 align:start position:0%
exception to the law that usually
 
04:16:55.550 --> 04:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
applies in tort cases that that you know
 
04:16:57.229 --> 04:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
the party plaintiff brings a lawsuit and
 
04:16:59.630 --> 04:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
it goes they do their Discovery they try
 
04:17:01.969 --> 04:17:01.979 align:start position:0%
to settle it goes to trial but here we
 
04:17:04.729 --> 04:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
have we've carved out this
 
04:17:07.670 --> 04:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
sort of separate practice for for
 
04:17:10.490 --> 04:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice cases and initially
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
it was the argument was well there are
 
04:17:14.030 --> 04:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
all these reasons we have to do it
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
insurance rates are up in the air
 
04:17:18.530 --> 04:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
there's frivolous cases being brought we
 
04:17:21.050 --> 04:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
need to do it for all these reasons
 
04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
turns out that those reasons don't
 
04:17:26.210 --> 04:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
really seem to be true
 
04:17:28.670 --> 04:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
and so my question is why do we have to
 
04:17:31.550 --> 04:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
have this special procedure that might
 
04:17:34.429 --> 04:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
be helpful in a few cases but in most
 
04:17:36.889 --> 04:17:36.899 align:start position:0%
most of the time is wave why why do we
 
04:17:39.769 --> 04:17:39.779 align:start position:0%
why is it worth it even if it is even if
 
04:17:42.650 --> 04:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
it is useful in a few cases well your
 
04:17:45.889 --> 04:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
numbers might go up for for
 
04:17:47.630 --> 04:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
um proceeding with the panel if it
 
04:17:49.070 --> 04:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
weren't so hard to get one and that is
 
04:17:50.750 --> 04:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
by no means a criticism of the Court
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
staff that have to find panel members
 
04:17:55.189 --> 04:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
and that's particularly the medical
 
04:17:59.210 --> 04:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
member if if it were easier it and I
 
04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
think it we heard that this the
 
04:18:03.410 --> 04:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
description of of a clerk having to
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
spend time looking up doctors and cold
 
04:18:08.210 --> 04:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
calling people if it were easier to
 
04:18:10.370 --> 04:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
establish a panel you wouldn't need all
 
04:18:12.349 --> 04:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
that lead time if you knew you were
 
04:18:15.170 --> 04:18:15.180 align:start position:0%
going to be able to get a panel a fair
 
04:18:18.769 --> 04:18:18.779 align:start position:0%
panel that met the requirements and that
 
04:18:20.750 --> 04:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
would be less of a reason to waive it
 
04:18:23.090 --> 04:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
their defense lawyers do waive it when
 
04:18:24.769 --> 04:18:24.779 align:start position:0%
it's just not coming together and we
 
04:18:27.050 --> 04:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
need to move on with the case I would
 
04:18:29.689 --> 04:18:29.699 align:start position:0%
say um
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
we we have mediation which is mandatory
 
04:18:35.450 --> 04:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
when rule 170 came out and then rule 30
 
04:18:38.330 --> 04:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
whatever so it's a mandatory and and you
 
04:18:40.610 --> 04:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
heard uh testimony that it's mandatory
 
04:18:42.710 --> 04:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
actually that sometimes gets waived as
 
04:18:44.689 --> 04:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
well when experienced councils say your
 
04:18:46.309 --> 04:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
honor we just see this case differently
 
04:18:48.349 --> 04:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
we have worked it up to a fairly well we
 
04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
know what we're doing and we think we
 
04:18:51.950 --> 04:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
need to go we have had instances where
 
04:18:53.990 --> 04:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
the judge said I won't waste your time
 
04:18:56.330 --> 04:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
or your expenditure on paying a mediator
 
04:19:00.590 --> 04:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
but and the and the role of mediation as
 
04:19:03.110 --> 04:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
a nearly mandatory requirement is and I
 
04:19:04.729 --> 04:19:04.739 align:start position:0%
agree with attorney Dugan on this point
 
04:19:07.010 --> 04:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
probably part of the another reason why
 
04:19:09.650 --> 04:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
panel use has been diminished so again
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's been diminished because it's been
 
04:19:13.790 --> 04:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
cumbersome there are some ways to make
 
04:19:16.849 --> 04:19:16.859 align:start position:0%
it more effective to and panel effective
 
04:19:19.010 --> 04:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
and efficient for court staff and
 
04:19:21.590 --> 04:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
participants between
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
um only only working to a panel them at
 
04:19:26.689 --> 04:19:26.699 align:start position:0%
after a certain commitment to go
 
04:19:29.110 --> 04:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
um compensating panelists
 
04:19:32.389 --> 04:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
and encouraging participation
 
04:19:34.490 --> 04:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
though it would be another tool
 
04:19:36.769 --> 04:19:36.779 align:start position:0%
sometimes we mediate sometimes we don't
 
04:19:39.229 --> 04:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
you know when rule 170 came out there
 
04:19:40.729 --> 04:19:40.739 align:start position:0%
were several other Alternatives and
 
04:19:42.530 --> 04:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
almost I don't know anyone who's ever
 
04:19:44.990 --> 04:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
used neutral evaluation it withered on
 
04:19:47.210 --> 04:19:47.220 align:start position:0%
the vine and it isn't used mediation
 
04:19:50.030 --> 04:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
became the go-to way to resolve cases if
 
04:19:52.429 --> 04:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
they weren't resolved after a panel all
 
04:19:53.750 --> 04:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
right thank you are the questions for
 
04:19:56.330 --> 04:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
this witness thank you very much thank
 
04:19:56.340 --> 04:19:57.110 align:start position:0%
this witness thank you very much thank
you

04:19:57.110 --> 04:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:19:58.969 --> 04:19:58.979 align:start position:0%
I don't have any other pink cards is
 
04:20:00.710 --> 04:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wishes to testify
 
04:20:02.929 --> 04:20:02.939 align:start position:0%

04:20:04.250 --> 04:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
all right then I'm going to close the
 
04:20:07.010 --> 04:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
hearing on sb65 and we're going to take

a 30 minute break when we will take up
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:26.390 --> 05:01:26.400 align:start position:0%

Polish name if that helps so it rhymes
 
05:01:48.288 --> 05:01:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:50.090 --> 05:01:50.100 align:start position:0%
um nice to be here with you guys today
 
05:01:52.190 --> 05:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
and my my pink card is making its way
 
05:01:54.830 --> 05:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
around to you so I am Senator Perkins
 
05:01:57.050 --> 05:01:57.060 align:start position:0%
cooka as the chairman stated um for the
 
05:01:58.430 --> 05:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
record from Senate District 21
 
05:02:01.490 --> 05:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
representing Portsmouth Durham New
 
05:02:03.830 --> 05:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
Market and several other Seacoast
 
05:02:03.840 --> 05:02:04.910 align:start position:0%
Market and several other Seacoast
communities

05:02:04.910 --> 05:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:02:06.830 --> 05:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:02:08.948 --> 05:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 264
 
05:02:11.448 --> 05:02:11.458 align:start position:0%
addresses essentially the assisted
 
05:02:14.030 --> 05:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
reproduction statute and the motivation
 
05:02:17.390 --> 05:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
of it is really to update it
 
05:02:19.070 --> 05:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
um I unfortunately had two very
 
05:02:21.590 --> 05:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
experienced practitioners here with me
 
05:02:23.690 --> 05:02:23.700 align:start position:0%
to answer the really technical questions
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
for you but
 
05:02:28.310 --> 05:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
um they both had to leave and so the
 
05:02:31.670 --> 05:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
intent really is to make sure that we
 
05:02:33.650 --> 05:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
are using our court system officially
 
05:02:36.770 --> 05:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
that we've sort of reflected in our
 
05:02:39.230 --> 05:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
assisted reproduction statute
 
05:02:41.930 --> 05:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
um realities that families experience
 
05:02:43.730 --> 05:02:43.740 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
um you know as a same-sex couple my wife
 
05:02:48.410 --> 05:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
and I have had two kids we've had to go
 
05:02:50.330 --> 05:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
through confirmatory adoption hearings
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
in the court system and there was
 
05:02:55.430 --> 05:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
um you know that's still the advice for
 
05:02:57.890 --> 05:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
same-sex couples even mothers like me
 
05:03:00.170 --> 05:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
who carried and gave birth to their two
 
05:03:03.110 --> 05:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
girls so I think what we want to make
 
05:03:04.730 --> 05:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
sure is just that
 
05:03:06.230 --> 05:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
um as Justice Lynn has probably
 
05:03:08.270 --> 05:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
experienced making sure we're respecting
 
05:03:10.610 --> 05:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
the efficiency of our dockets if we
 
05:03:11.868 --> 05:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
could just provide some of these
 
05:03:15.890 --> 05:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
language updates in the bill it not only
 
05:03:18.530 --> 05:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
um provides Assurance to a wider
 
05:03:20.750 --> 05:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
audience but also makes our statute more
 
05:03:22.910 --> 05:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
inclusive to reflect
 
05:03:26.150 --> 05:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
um same-sex couples and just sort of the
 
05:03:28.310 --> 05:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
the many ways that families come to be
 
05:03:30.410 --> 05:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so I think that we all
 
05:03:33.050 --> 05:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
share a goal of making sure that our
 
05:03:35.330 --> 05:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
families are healthy and thriving and
 
05:03:37.448 --> 05:03:37.458 align:start position:0%
our kids are well taken care of and so
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
creating certainty around assisted
 
05:03:43.010 --> 05:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
reproduction parental rights donor
 
05:03:45.590 --> 05:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
rights surrogate rights gestational
 
05:03:48.770 --> 05:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
carrier agreements it's that is really
 
05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill
 
05:03:51.120 --> 05:03:51.770 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill
um

05:03:51.770 --> 05:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:57.050 --> 05:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
and so with that I think I will probably
 
05:03:59.270 --> 05:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
wrap up to take any questions with one
 
05:04:01.970 --> 05:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
final note that um you'll you'll see in
 
05:04:03.830 --> 05:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
the docket that at
 
05:04:05.330 --> 05:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
um at the end of the day this was a
 
05:04:07.010 --> 05:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
bipartisan vote coming out of the Senate
 
05:04:09.288 --> 05:04:09.298 align:start position:0%
and so we were able to work together on
 
05:04:11.570 --> 05:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan basis to resolve a couple
 
05:04:13.550 --> 05:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
language concerns
 
05:04:16.850 --> 05:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
um about pronouns but I did not receive
 
05:04:18.590 --> 05:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
any concerns about the technical aspects
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
of the bill so happy to answer any
 
05:04:23.270 --> 05:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
questions right questions for this
 
05:04:23.280 --> 05:04:26.390 align:start position:0%
questions right questions for this
Witness

05:04:26.390 --> 05:04:26.400 align:start position:0%

and I take it no one I see anyone else
 
05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
here to testify on 264 264.
 
05:04:45.708 --> 05:04:45.718 align:start position:0%

05:04:46.850 --> 05:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
