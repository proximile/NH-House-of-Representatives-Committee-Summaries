00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
well um we we make this trip
 
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
once a year um it's uh this fifty
 
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is used uh
 
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
for um for emergency repairs at our
 
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
facilities before the portsmouth fish
 
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.150 align:start position:0%
facilities before the portsmouth fish
pier

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
pier
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh rye harbor facility in the hampton
 
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
facility as everyone on the committee
 
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
knows we
 
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
we have pretty harsh weather conditions
 
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire and it's a
 
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
little more
 
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
a little more harsh along the seacoast
 
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know with uh with wind water and
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
wave action
 
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
so our facilities uh they feel the brunt
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
of that and um
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
we prefer not to use this money in an
 
00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
emergency capacity but um
 
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
on occasion you know we'll have things
 
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
that that break or fail
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
so that is that is what this fifty
 
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is is set aside for um
 
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 align:start position:0%
there's a process that we go through we
 
00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.189 align:start position:0%
there's a process that we go through we
uh

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
we actually have to have approval from
 
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
the peace development authority board of
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
directors before we expend the money um
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
but this
 
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
the nature of these failures at the uh
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
facilities are such that
 
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
the the repairs have to be made pretty
 
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.550 align:start position:0%
the the repairs have to be made pretty
quickly

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
quickly
