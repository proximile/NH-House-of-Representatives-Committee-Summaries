00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:53.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:21.840 --> 00:03:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
okay so what i'd like to do is go ahead
 
00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
and start the meeting here on the
 
00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
foundation budget formula that we've
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
today is the last day that we will be
 
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
meeting as a subcommittee on that bill
 
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
seeing that we have to take action
 
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh on the
 
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
ninth and tenth and then by the tenth by
 
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.030 align:start position:0%
ninth and tenth and then by the tenth by
noon

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
noon
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
so what we need to do today is that
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
there will be a report or recommendation
 
00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
coming from this group right here
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
and what we want to do is look at
 
00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 align:start position:0%
if we report
 
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 align:start position:0%
interim study what are some of the
 
00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 align:start position:0%
things we'd like to see in interim study
 
00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.670 align:start position:0%
things we'd like to see in interim study
address

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh so that's where i'd like to focus
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
today on some of those questions that
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know folks might be coming up with
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
and so let's open it up to that
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
type of discussion at this time uh we do
 
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
have mark here too did he have a
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
specific uh or is he as technical advice
 
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
technical support okay so
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
those sitting are our gallery of two if
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
you have any uh thing you want to you
 
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
know offer at any time just wave it in
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
did anybody write down any concerns or
 
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
questions or things through maybe an
 
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
first of all maybe we ought to discuss
 
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 align:start position:0%
that is that where everybody here is
 
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
really and thinking we want to go with
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
this bill as interim study i see that
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
that that's a good point and and there
 
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
is a lot of good in it there's a lot of
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
questions in it
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
and so uh interim study i think is very
 
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.990 align:start position:0%
and so uh interim study i think is very
appropriate

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
and so that way we could keep rolling on
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
not through this subcommittee but
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
through the interim study
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
which would be fine
 
00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:46.950 align:start position:0%
which would be fine
so

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
uh so you had uh
 
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i i mean i i think
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
i probably speak for everybody when i
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
say that uh ultimately
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to need examples of how this
 
00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
is going to interpret be interpreted
 
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
into real life in each community and
 
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%
you know take a look at
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
how the formula weighs out in terms of
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
the impact on the taxpayer but
 
00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759 align:start position:0%
i think that's that goes without saying
 
00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree any education funding
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
you have to have a
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet or it's not going to get
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
voted on if sometimes i mean you're
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
voting for your constituents and if
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to lose money
 
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
you're not going to vote for it and
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
that's the way it works i'm sorry but
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
that's the way it works but
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
but i think what needs to be studied too
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
is freedom of study is the
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
adma formula thing there's a lot there
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
and i think that's something that can
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
you define that a little bit more ralph
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
well on page
 
00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:52.710 align:start position:0%
well on page
four

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
okay for purpose of the weighted means
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
we respect each school district so i
 
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.469 align:start position:0%
we respect each school district so i
think

00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
that really needs to look at and maybe
 
00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:01.270 align:start position:0%
that really needs to look at and maybe
with

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
how that's going to affect
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of a spreadsheet you know the
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
first uh
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
number one that sue was addressing how
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
this weighs out in in terms of local
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities and communities
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
um and they and we know that
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
the house members will immediately want
 
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
to see where their particular town a b
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
or c is on this and and what the
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
difference is and or what our gain what
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
our loss might be
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of dollars
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
we have the spreadsheet that was
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
provided to us the other day by mark
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
is the lba also working on something or
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
how is that going to work
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
so um mark and and mickey and i have
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
have talked about about this
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think given the uh the
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
direction that the bill's going what
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
mark has provided is a draft
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
and um and and as the as we move into
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
interim study and sort of leading from
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
what ralph was um was talking about
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
obviously the bill um has a um
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
well the bill has an eight year but the
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
the the really the the
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
developed con you know idea here is a
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
10-year phase-in
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
plan so so i i think it would make a lot
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
of sense for people to understand what
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
their towns would be seeing
 
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
as it's phased in over over a decade
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
and and the first year
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
which mark provided um
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh last week
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
is is terrific and there was a lot of i
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
mean you know mark talked about how how
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know this is a very involved very
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
comprehensive formula but in the first
 
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
year all the towns are there's a hold
 
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.870 align:start position:0%
year all the towns are there's a hold
harmless

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
harmless
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
so so you don't actually see
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
your your your impact your downside
 
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.949 align:start position:0%
your your your impact your downside
impact

00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
and um and i think it would be important
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
to see that over the over certainly the
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
the the 10-year period
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
and um and you know you've got that
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
you've got a five-year transition grant
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
that phases down and then you've got a
 
00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:18.949 align:start position:0%
that phases down and then you've got a
10-year

00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
10-year
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget that
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
transitions up
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
so so some towns may see a dip at the
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
beginning but then an increase later on
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
and uh uh
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know and i think there's there's
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
there's more work that we'll be able to
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
do during the interim study period to
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
illustrate that when you're at the first
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
step of the five-year phased uh process
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
down there with using the hold harmless
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh what what's the
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
the total cost for the hold harmless
 
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.110 align:start position:0%
the total cost for the hold harmless
verse

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
verse
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
stables you know
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
stabilization i use this anonymous sorry
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
sure so so it's obviously more in the
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
the the most is in the first year
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
and so so the hold harmless that you can
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
see it in the in page two column i
 
00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:09.310 align:start position:0%
see it in the in page two column i
it's

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
112 million dollars in the first year
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
and uh and that goes down to zero over
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
five years
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
in uh um in the aggregate over those
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
five years it's about 250 million
 
00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:22.790 align:start position:0%
five years it's about 250 million
dollars

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
and the idea
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
would be that that that would come from
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
federal arpa dollars as other states are
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
using these in similar ways
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
and um and uh you know very good
 
00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:36.470 align:start position:0%
and um and uh you know very good
question

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
now where do you where do you say that
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
was located
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
so that's in that's in the bill no no on
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
this phone oh sorry sorry on the
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet on the on the second page
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
that mark um handed out two of six
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
there were two that mark okay okay
 
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
that's my problem okay i see it now yeah
 
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.470 align:start position:0%
that's my problem okay i see it now yeah
okay

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
make sure you get the i don't know what
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.190 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
i might have more there were there are
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
um i've actually i've got the um mark
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
emailed me the pdfs i can
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
i can send those we could also you know
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
just get copies of one of these made
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
upstairs for you
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
yeah mark's got him so
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
well i mean we could take a few minutes
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
and just sort of you know bring ralph up
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
to speed
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
on that and
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
take about five minutes to do it yeah
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
well when he has that in front of him
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
yeah mark's got it
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
do you want uh
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
mark to do that or
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
mark magnanello administrator of the
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
office of school finance with the
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
so what we discussed last week and and
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
it is kind of hard to to look at this as
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
a from a cold read or just looking at
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
the bill and looking at the spreadsheet
 
00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
and it's it's telling if the total
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
weights and the total weights will be
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
multiplied by 6501
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
and that will equal
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
the annual foundation opportunity budget
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
so going through that process left to
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
right ratting up
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
similar to the existing formula we're
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
adding up all the adms so 180m
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
equals one weight so one it's a one for
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
one ratio there
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
um then we're adding up the fnr adms
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
similar to the existing formula except
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
instead of timesing them by a dollar
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
amount we're multiplying it by a weight
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
the weight is 1.49
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
sped adm uh this is the highest weight
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
um each sped adm is multiplied by
 
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.910 align:start position:0%
um each sped adm is multiplied by
4.298

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
4.298
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
the weight
 
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:26.949 align:start position:0%
the weight
so

00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
so just multiplying that 4.2 times 6501
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:11.189 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
yeah the full weight of that 27k per
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
sped student is not felt um it's not
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
felt in uh ever because the 95 under the
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
bill the 95 is always there so it's
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
always going to be 95 percent of the 27
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
000 dollars
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
but yeah uh representative luna is
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
correct it's uh going to be uh uh
 
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.509 align:start position:0%
correct it's uh going to be uh uh
uh

00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
what uh uh taken down to 70
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
then 74 and then progressively get right
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
and really important to remember too
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
that that while this is calculated on an
 
00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:40.870 align:start position:0%
that that while this is calculated on an
adm

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
adm
 
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.069 align:start position:0%
adm
basis

00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
the total
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
of all of that is is is really it's it's
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
a foundation opportunity budget for a
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
school district to educate all of its
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
students so it's not
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
it's not that you know david luno costs
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
the school district 28 000
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
student characteristics contribute this
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
to developing of
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
the entire foundation budget
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and i think we had conversations
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
last week about it being average cost
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
not particularly one particular student
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's the sum of all the students
 
00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:22.390 align:start position:0%
it's it's the sum of all the students
weighted

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
weighted
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
equals up right you know an average uh
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
cost essentially right
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
so i i do it before we go on the other
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
sheet the spreadsheet i have a question
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
regarding this the weights here for
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
the adm sizes like 100 to 200 201 etc
 
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.270 align:start position:0%
the adm sizes like 100 to 200 201 etc
etc

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
etc
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
small district
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
that has 80 kids or 110 20 kids
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
including high school level kids
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
are the high school kids given a
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
weighted formula based upon the size of
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
the sending district or of the co-op
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
maybe that there are members of where
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
the you know the high school is located
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
based upon the enrollment of the that
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
high school
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
or the co-op high school or the
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
individual district that's
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
they're coming from um
 
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.390 align:start position:0%
they're coming from um
so

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
i'm using so i i'm not sure i understand
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
because this this can get um there's a
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
lot of different configurations on how
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
you can send your students and sometimes
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
you send your students to a co-op but
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
you're not part of the co-op but
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes you're a community that's part
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
of the co-op or you're tuitioning your
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
kids to a high school so it's not meant
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
the way i calculated this and the way i
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
interpreted this and if this bill were
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
to become law the way i would uh
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
implement it would be admr across the
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
board so
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
if you're tuitioning your student in
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
it's going to be based on the sending
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
district purely not where they're
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
attending it's going to be purely based
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
on the district of financial
 
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.470 align:start position:0%
on the district of financial
responsibility

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh so if you're a community part of a
 
00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.230 align:start position:0%
uh so if you're a community part of a
cooperative

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
cooperative
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
your cooperative would be
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's difficult here and i and there's a
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
lot of math that goes behind this but i
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
do a portion out let's let's use
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
where is an example k through 8 where
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
school district
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
9 through 12 john stark school district
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
so i do a portion out that i looked at
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
all the students in where
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the ones that went to uh k through
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
eight i looked at that particular
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
district which is a k-8 district and
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
looked at how many students are in that
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
district so it's not based on school
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's based on district um
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
then i looked at 9 through 12 and looked
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
at all the where students who are
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
students who live and where who are the
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility of the john
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
stark district
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
so it's always based on district of
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility not adma not
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
where the student's attending but what
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
what district is financially responsible
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
um which is essentially the sending
 
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.630 align:start position:0%
um which is essentially the sending
district

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
so if that helps yeah i understand that
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
my only
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
question was that the
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
cost of delivering the services at that
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
high score based upon
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
that high school not on what the sending
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
the sending district has to come up with
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
the tuition monies if they're a k-8
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
then they tuition out to
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
the receiving high school which might be
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
a high school that's
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
five times the size of the
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
smaller district the smaller district is
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
going to get so many dollars per
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
per youngster
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
which is probably more than they would
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
at that larger school on that weighted
 
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.510 align:start position:0%
at that larger school on that weighted
formula

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
you bring up a good point and that could
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
be a challenge i think that's a policy
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
challenge in mechanical challenge with
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
this uh this bill
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
there could be some scenarios where
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
maybe the objective or intent of this
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
potential weight is not doing what it's
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to do there's a possibility for
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
that i'd have to look into the weeds as
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
far as is that occurring um is there a
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
mix match where maybe
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
the scenario you're describing
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative is creating a mix match
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
or uh
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
a weight that
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
the intent of it didn't include um
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
so yeah i have to dive into that further
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
that might be something the study
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
committee would definitely want to uh
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
take a peek and do right right if it's
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
creating mixed matches or technical
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
flaws with how the data is collected and
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
rolled up into the formula right right i
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
think the intent is um
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
is is that it's it's based on the um
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
the uh you know the the size of the
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
district that uh that the um or the uh
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
make sure you get this
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
the the size of the district that the
 
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.350 align:start position:0%
the the size of the district that the
the

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
student is attending
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
so that if if hooksett sends its high
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
school kids
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
to pinkerton
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
then then
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
cost the
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
the cost associated with those high
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
school kids is based on the pinkerton
 
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.590 align:start position:0%
school kids is based on the pinkerton
size

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
size
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
okay that's right yes that's not how
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
this is being correct yeah so i i think
 
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
the intent
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
was but but we could i think that's this
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
is a really important thing
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
for for interim study make sure we
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
confirm that attempt and then make sure
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
that we've got the language that that
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
also uh
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
using hooksett as an example
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
not only do they send their kids to
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
pinkerton they also send their kids to
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
manchester central and to manchester
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
west as well
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
the size those three high schools are
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
going to be three different sizes
 
00:22:30.159 --> 00:22:31.110 align:start position:0%
going to be three different sizes
right

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.669 align:start position:0%
right
right

00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
that that's fairly common throughout the
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
state and from many of the smaller
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
school districts the one i'm talking
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
about that just south of me
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
they send them down to thetford academy
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
they send them the muscoma they send
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
them to saint j they send them to
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
woodsville high school they send them to
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
oxbow over in vermont so there's five
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
different options available and the
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
and one of the challenges with
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
we talked a little bit about the
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
technical challenges is if you're a
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
we have the attendance
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have the idea may for pinkerton
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i i don't know if we
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
have the admit for pinkerton um we
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
certainly have the adma of students from
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
hooksett going into manchester um
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
we we have the adma for public schools
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
within the state we do not have the adma
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
for any school in massachusetts that a
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
ascending district might send their
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
students to or any or vermont or maine
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
for that matter um so there's situations
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
where you would be sending your student
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
to another school
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
um and we would not necessarily have
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
data on that so there could be a gap in
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
our data or or there could be a
 
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:45.039 align:start position:0%
workaround in the bill a workaround
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
could be devised in the bill if you
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
studied it
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
the other thing too is i think you're
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
talking about schools and so schools are
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
different than school districts so a lot
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
of these larger school districts if
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about school level
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh if you're a school district north of
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
2000 adm uh you don't qualify for this
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
way but if we're now for talking school
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
like just uh you know manchester high
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
school uh manchester west et cetera
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about a lower
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
population lower adm so you might
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
trigger some of these weights if we're
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
now measuring at the school level so
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
another thing to think about and just to
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
file that conversation i know of one
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
district that's just north of myself
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
which has a wonderful dam on the
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
connecticut river
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
makes big bucks also has a large egg
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
producing farm there so they are a donor
 
00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.190 align:start position:0%
producing farm there so they are a donor
town

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
but they're also sending their students
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
to a independent school
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
which has a high tuition cost
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
so by
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
the the swept would come into play where
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
they don't get to keep the excess
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
in this a funnels bath to five years
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
well no no because the the
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
the swept in in in uh in the bill yeah
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
is um is just like any other state tax
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so we're changing from what it is
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
to afford to do what they're doing with
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
their tuition program right now maybe
 
00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:06.549 align:start position:0%
their tuition program right now maybe
that's

00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
that will be a concern from some place
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
and that happens to be the town of
 
00:25:10.799 --> 00:25:15.510 align:start position:0%
and that happens to be the town of
monroe

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
that whole swept issue is going to be an
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
issue that's going to have to
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
have some answers to
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
i think with this study because i it is
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
going to cause
 
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.269 align:start position:0%
going to cause
sort

00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
sort
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
disrupt people are there are going to be
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
communities that are not going to like
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
that and we have to have some good
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
defense for it i believe
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
am i out of line here saying this no
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
you're not because i come from a
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
community which would benefit from this
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
forum yes definitely however i
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
understand the complexities
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
and the constitutional issues associated
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
with where you're coming from so i think
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
something very important is to is to
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
recognize the constitutional issues with
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
regards to swept um what's uh what's
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
what's very good is that is that well
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
while we're
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
interim studying this we're doing it in
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
parallel with ways and means who's going
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
to be really
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
dedicating their their time on the
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
so that's the um still going through the
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
weights and yeah
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
one of the the ell fnr sped those are
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
those are data sets we're used to
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
the the cooperative
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
or the the weights based on school
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
district size is something that um
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
we're still uh we we had some
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
conversations about that of course and
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
some of the technical aspects of that um
 
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
more going on with that weight than say
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
our other weights
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
the other weights include
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
column p there on that first excel
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
grade six through eight um gets a weight
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
of 1.42
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
grades 9 through 12 gets a weight of
 
00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.950 align:start position:0%
grades 9 through 12 gets a weight of
0.42

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
0.42
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
so that's the weights the weights get
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
tallied up uh 450 000 weights
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
and then for each
 
00:26:59.789 --> 00:26:59.799 align:start position:0%
municipality it's multiplied by
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
6501 and that gets you
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
your annual foundation opportunity
 
00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.269 align:start position:0%
your annual foundation opportunity
budget

00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
unmodified unadjusted this is sort of
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
the raw the raw data from that
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
that calculation
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
so then we move on to the next excel tab
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
which has dollars associated with it
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
and so so so mark just just uh
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to interrupt just but just a
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
sort of editorial uh interjection here
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
so when you get to column uh u
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
which which is the
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
the total of all those weights
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
multiplied by the base we haven't gotten
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
to the 95 percent and 70 percent part
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
but now you've basically got to the
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
dollars that were spent on on public
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
schools for fy 19
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
which was when this um
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
that was the data that was used because
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
that was the only complete data we that
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
um that was available at the time all of
 
00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
this was uh was done so so you've got to
 
00:28:03.679 --> 00:28:04.750 align:start position:0%
this was uh was done so so you've got to
that

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.310 align:start position:0%
that
2.92

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
2.92
 
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.830 align:start position:0%
2.92
um

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
number that's correct yeah i think um
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
that number is obviously always changing
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
but it's a pretty close approximation
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
give or take a few dozen million are
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
here or there but it's pretty right but
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's pretty close
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
a mark on the uh
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
grade level adm weights
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
um k-8 1.42 high school
 
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.870 align:start position:0%
um k-8 1.42 high school
.42

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
.42
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
if you look at your funding formula
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
right now that we have in play
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
elementary costs
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
i believe are higher
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
than the junior high costs
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
i believe that's true and i have to look
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
at that more recently and i think i was
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
actually talking to some some of our
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
federal uh counterparts and um that is
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
not uh how it normally is most most
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
states have higher high school costs um
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
but yeah i think new hampshire's unique
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
in a sense our elementary schools for
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
one reason you look at a lot of the
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
elementary classrooms not maybe in
 
00:29:03.679 --> 00:29:05.110 align:start position:0%
elementary classrooms not maybe in
manchester

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:05.909 align:start position:0%
manchester
but

00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
12-1 14-1
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
then you get up into the high school
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
where you get the block scheduling and
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
everything else and it closes it gets
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
into their where we're funding them at
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
at the um uh 30 to one level or or 25 to
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
30 level to one
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
i i'd like to see some further work
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
from a policy perspective
 
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
whether we're really
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
giving whether we should be giving a
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
weight of some kind to
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
laurel uh elementary and and uh and up
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
through that those middle intermediate
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
level grades uh it seems to me they're
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
going to be there's no way to tall for
 
00:29:46.399 --> 00:29:48.549 align:start position:0%
going to be there's no way to tall for
them

00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
when in fact the facts now show that
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
they are costing more
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
than the upper levels
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
you rick on that too at the lower level
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
there is more
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
subs and assistance and what not in the
 
00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:05.269 align:start position:0%
subs and assistance and what not in the
classroom

00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
that increases the cost well you have
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know the prep periods new usually
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's a librarian or a
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
art teacher or a music teacher or pe
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
teacher comes in and you know that's how
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
we float around different days you get
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
different types of specials
 
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:20.950 align:start position:0%
different types of specials
um

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
it also parallels the negotiated
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
agreements uh it's re they're all it's
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
all related and that's how initially in
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
2008 the formula is set up based upon
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
the understanding
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
so this is a thought elementary l is
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh so moving on to that second
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
second handout that one that
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
actually turns into the dollar
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
not just focusing on the weights but
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
focusing on the dollar amounts um column
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
c we're starting off where we left off
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
with the weights times 6 500 and 1
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
so that's the 2.9 billion there
 
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
the next step is column d
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
which is first um
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
kind of right off the bat you apply 95
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
percent um so upside five percent
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
decrease to whatever the um that raw
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
number is that column c number
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
so that's called the uh and the bill
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's called the efficiency factor and
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
that's taken off
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh five percent taken off right away
 
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
then the other percentage that's applied
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
is the i believe it's called the
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
transition factor and so for fiscal year
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
24 it's 70 percent but as representative
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
luna was discussing um kind of i'd call
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
this a phase up it's going to increase
 
00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:38.710 align:start position:0%
this a phase up it's going to increase
um

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh so it's 70 in 24 and i think under
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
the bill it's it's um
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
four percent in 25 and representative
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
lunos talked about
 
00:31:47.679 --> 00:31:49.190 align:start position:0%
lunos talked about
potentially

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
playing with that to make the phase in
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
smoother or flatter
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
you could make it quicker or shorter
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
depending on how you want to play with
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
that transition number that's going to
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
have a big impact on
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
the end results
 
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:04.789 align:start position:0%
the end results
so

00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
if you apply the 95
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
then you apply the 70 percent now we're
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
from we're going from 2.9 billion down
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
to 1.9 billion
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
so this is called the adjusted annual
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget so the 2.9
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
billion is really the foundation
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget and now we're
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
adjusting it
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
to bring it down to 1.9 billion and the
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
way to think about this similar to the
 
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
current formula is this is essentially
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
the state's obligation the states
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
the state is required to provide a cost
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
of inadequate education this is
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
essentially replacing that
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
thinking of this 1.9 billion as the cost
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
of inadequate education
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
so that's the benchmark the standard the
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
standard that the state will be held to
 
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
in this proposed bill
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
the next step is column e and f so
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
column e is a five dollars per thousand
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
tax rate um
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
applied to the equalized valuation
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
property of each municipality so
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
uh applying that five dollar rate each
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
if each community is able to raise
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
through a five dollar
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
five dollars per thousand tax rate
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
they're able to raise off their
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
equalized valuated property 1.1 billion
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
so this is kind of the local this is
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
called the local contribution
 
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.590 align:start position:0%
called the local contribution
um

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
uh so basically we have a two point
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
billion standard the locals raise one
 
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.590 align:start position:0%
billion standard the locals raise one
point

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
a 1.9 billion standard the locals raised
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
1.1 billion in local taxes and so
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
there's a delta there that delta is
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
essentially the state's obligation
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
but there's a little bit more math that
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
needs to occur
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
to actually define the minimum local
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
contribution we don't just use that five
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
dollars per thousand rate we look at
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
what is your five dollars per thousand
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
in equalized evaluated uh property
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
values um and then we also look at what
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
is your adjusted annual foundation
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget and we determine the
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
lesser of the two so that brings that
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
1.1 billion dollar number down to about
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
1 billion even
 
00:33:57.519 --> 00:33:58.470 align:start position:0%
1 billion even
so

00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
um similar process we're going to
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:02.389 align:start position:0%
similar to
just

00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
stop right there and
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
have a question so we're going to do
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
five five dollars per per thousand here
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
and we know we're going to need around
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
12 point something 12.3 or whatever
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
total so that means the swept is going
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
to have to kick in somewhere along or
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
with the 7.2 7.5 whatever it might be
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
to round things out we're going to get
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
to that but we had talked once before
 
00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:30.389 align:start position:0%
to that but we had talked once before
of

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
maybe there's two ways of doing this
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
one way would be to have the five per
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
thousand for everybody like this or just
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
to have the 12 point whatever is
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
necessary so so there's there's there's
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
two parts of this the five per thousand
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
is not swept
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
i get that that's the local education
 
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.389 align:start position:0%
i get that that's the local education
tax

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
for the for the to to come up with the
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
the local um minimum contribution
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
and what mark's talking about here is
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
that in some country in some towns
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
we say another way in most towns
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh most cities and towns the five
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
dollars per thousand isn't going to get
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
you all the way to your foundation
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget you're going to need
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
support from the state
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
in some towns
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
it gets you
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
there and more and for those towns
 
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.870 align:start position:0%
there and more and for those towns
you're

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
you don't have to raise any more locally
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
than your foundation opportunity budget
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
so so for uh you know for a town that
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
might have a lake or an ocean um those
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
towns would would have a local minimum
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
contribution of of uh less than five
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
because we're just trying to we're just
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
trying to take care of the foundation
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget right now
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
and you know sort of like what we talked
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
about how um how in
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts which has
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
has begun its phase in of of a similar
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
program called the massachusetts chapter
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
70 school funding plan
 
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.589 align:start position:0%
70 school funding plan
um

00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
towns like wellesley
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
they're all they're they're all set
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
where towns like lawrence um are working
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
just as hard as the towns like walter
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
but they don't have to work harder so
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
the state comes in and helps them get
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
the the rest of the way so so the
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up i have on that
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
on the five dollars per thousand is any
 
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.470 align:start position:0%
on the five dollars per thousand is any
community

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
going to have to remem act remit back to
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
state excess
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
from the 5 000 no no
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
that comes later um
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
so the other 24 communities end up
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
having no not even not even talking
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
about that what comes
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
so the um yeah with the five dollars per
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
thousand none of that is sent to
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
to the state that is a local
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
contribution towards your foundation
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget if you can't hit your
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
budget with that that's where state
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
dollars come in if you do hit your
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
budget with that
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
you're you're fine
 
00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.589 align:start position:0%
you're you're fine
um

00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:57.599 --> 00:36:58.550 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
when we when we get when mark gets to
 
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
column k
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to see the state raises um
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
363 million dollars through the
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
statewide education property tax that
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
goes into the education trust fund the
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
same way
 
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.069 align:start position:0%
same way
um

00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh dollars from the business profits tax
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax lottery
 
00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.670 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax lottery
commission

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
and a smattering of other things that
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
are that are documented in the um in the
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh consolidated um
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
or comprehensive annual financial report
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh lists all those things out
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
so so that's um that's collected locally
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
the locals get to keep uh three percent
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh what do we call it a transaction cost
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
yep and uh and then the rest gets
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
remitted to the to the treasury um the
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
same way all other
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
taxes are collected in the state yeah i
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
think that's um
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
we're kind of we haven't even
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
we're still in the measuring phase at
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
this part of the formula we're we're
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
measuring baselines and top lines or
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
benchmarks essentially and floors um but
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah eventually it's going to turn into
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
dollars but yeah i think it's helpful to
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
think about it this this before it turns
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
into dollars it's measuring benchmarks
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
and floors um but it's of course it's
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
going to turn into real dollars that
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
impacts funding but um
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh and i know swept is now um
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
yes we can have a conversation about
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
swept if you want to talk about
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
um uh all swept will be going to the
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
state uh uh 97 of swept will be going to
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund so that will be
 
00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.349 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund so that will be
um

00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
some communities will be losing a swept
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
grant but they might be getting a
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
transition grant or a state opportunity
 
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.670 align:start position:0%
transition grant or a state opportunity
grant

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
any discussion on that
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i understand this now
 
00:38:55.359 --> 00:38:57.589 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i understand this now
so

00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
we have two communities one that's
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
property rich community okay i don't
 
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.750 align:start position:0%
property rich community okay i don't
know

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
idyllica somewhere in the lakes region
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
and then we have depression which is
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the poor area okay but
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
but there's going to be equalized
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
valuation of the properties in both
 
00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.829 align:start position:0%
valuation of the properties in both
towns

00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:39:17.839 --> 00:39:19.349 align:start position:0%
towns
so

00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
i know i asked this before but i forgot
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
the answer so the 2500 square foot house
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
on two acres in depression is going to
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
have the same equalized valuation as the
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
2500 square foot house in a delica no
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
the equalized valuation process is just
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.470 align:start position:0%
to um
um

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
is just to sync up uh standardized
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
assessment practices because you could
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
have one community that's really slow
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
with their assessments and that would be
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
unfair because it would artificially
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so depression has a house
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
valued at two hundred thousand dollars
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
five dollars per thousand five hundred
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
five times two hundred is the thousand
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
dollars in there in their tax
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
idyllica has a
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
million dollar house okay so they're
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
going to collect that much
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
of a million what is it what is i lost
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
the number of the zeros there in my head
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
but you know what i'm saying so
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
depression gets money from the state
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
angelica keeps all that money
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh to go toward its schools yes so
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
yeah uh i think that's um we'll
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
we'll pick uh
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
well maybe i'll i'll look at alton alton
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
is kind of the first uh um
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
community on this list i liked idyllica
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
i thought that was kind of well you know
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i think what's important to to
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
recognize here is that is that um
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation all that means is
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
that is that
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
the fair market of a home in hopkins
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's pretty you know pretty
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
close to fair market value in hopkinton
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
pretty close to fair market value in
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro and and uh and you know
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
because everybody has their own
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
assessing practices and the state now
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
has this fantastic um
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
system called mosaic
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
that that compares
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
transactions with
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
with with assessment rates and can can
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
come up with equalized valuation ratios
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
they put this in place in 2014
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
2015 following a a lawsuit by quote
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
donor towns back in the back in the day
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
that basically said hey how can you
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
compare a rate
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
in hillsborough with a rate in hopkinton
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
you can't we don't have any way of
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
equalizing the valuations and now we
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
have that in place
 
00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.630 align:start position:0%
have that in place
and

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
and so uh
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
so now you can actually
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
implement a
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
state property tax and have it be fair
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
just just yeah sorry yeah there you go i
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
i just so
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
that local contribution is just going to
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
stay in the town
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
for the schools the local contribution
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
if it's not enough
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
to meet what this bill says it should be
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
then we're going to pump some state
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
money in absolutely if it is enough then
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
they don't have to worry about anything
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
plus they can do their school
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
they can do more if they have it right
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
yeah with so with some of these towns
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
and i'll just i'll pick up pick on alton
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
because it's i know it's the prince tiny
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
alton on column g you see the first zero
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
kind of for alton and what's what is
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
showing me with alton is
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
um alton's
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
adjusted annual foundation opportunity
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
budget their their benchmark the
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
standard that the state that must be
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
held to under this bill uh 7.8 million
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
but we look at how much they raise five
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
dollars per thousand uh
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
so they raised 10 million under that
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
rate so they already have the seven
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
million they need to provide that um
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget under this
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill so they're not going to get any
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
state dollars okay and they also get to
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
keep they get to keep that yes
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
but i mean just because we're now and
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to get later in the formula
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
they don't get to keep swept or they get
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
to keep three percent of swept so that's
 
00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.109 align:start position:0%
to keep three percent of swept so that's
another

00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
part of this thing
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you that's i think
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's what i wanted to find out
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
but but under current swept law they're
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
keeping a lot more than three percent
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
yeah you know another way you can look
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
at the local contribution is is really
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
it put its fiscal capacity disparity
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
and uh and so if if through the five
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
dollars per thousand you don't have
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
enough to reach the um of the budget the
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
state comes in with the with the aid
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
because your fiscal capacity wasn't
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
sufficient to get there
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
for towns that that do have the capacity
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
then um then it's either less or
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
not existing and towns also have our
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
districts also have the option of
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
making their local
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
local tax higher than five dollars a
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
thousand if they want more
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
than the state is providing which is
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
great which most
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
will most schools probably want that
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
because this is like a base level that
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
we're coming up with so it depends some
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
some are going to um going to see that
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
that that this raises their um
 
00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:16.950 align:start position:0%
that that this raises their um
um

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
that this improves their school budget
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
we say it that way
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
others might might say look we need to
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
we need to raise uh raise a little bit
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
more to uh to meet uh
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
what what we feel are the expectations
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
of our community but that's something
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to be debated on the uh on
 
00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:33.670 align:start position:0%
that's going to be debated on the uh on
the

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
school district meeting anyway right i
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
mean they do that anyway yeah okay thank
 
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.589 align:start position:0%
mean they do that anyway yeah okay thank
you

00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
so so yeah just just going go continuing
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
to go on
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
we've got that starting from the
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
beginning again column d we got that
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
adjusted annual foundation opportunity
 
00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.270 align:start position:0%
adjusted annual foundation opportunity
budget

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
knocked down by percentages
 
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
that will eventually phase up
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
1.9 billion we're looking at the local
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
contribution it's a billion so now that
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
state opportunity grant is the first
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
determination of funds under this uh a
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
grant first grant calculation
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
it's that delta between the uh
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
the benchmark which is the adjusted
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
annual foundation opportunity budget and
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
then the floor which is the minimum
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
local contribution so
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
the state comes in and picks up the
 
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
slack there and that produces 935
 
00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:21.829 align:start position:0%
slack there and that produces 935
million

00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
in state state grants
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
then we have
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh column h is the
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
is the measuring of the hold harmless
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
and there's some uh
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if we want to get two in the
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
weeds again with this but um there's a
 
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
the way statute says total education
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
grant in rsa 198 total education grant
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually mean the total
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
education grant
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
it means it means your grant minus
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
stabilization essentially um
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
so it's a little a little uh technical
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
there and that's something that the
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
study committee could probably want to
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
take a peek at
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
um but this only uh well
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
yeah something something to put in put
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
in the uh on your keep in mind
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
so fiscal year 23 is the benchmark
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
that's the hold harmless um
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh what you mean to be held harmless to
 
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:10.470 align:start position:0%
uh what you mean to be held harmless to
uh

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
so for if we look at something a town
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
like alton
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
they received 20 they're receiving zero
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
dollars from the state because their ev
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
their five dollar per thousand is so
 
00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.470 align:start position:0%
their five dollar per thousand is so
high

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
high
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
that they're not
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
there's no gap to fill there under this
 
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.349 align:start position:0%
there's no gap to fill there under this
measurement

00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
measurement
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
but they will be held harmless in a
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
sense that whatever money they are
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
getting from the state
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
as a total education grant in 23
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
they will get um as a transition grant
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
so you'll see there
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
um they got 2.7 million their total
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
education grant was 2.7 million in
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23.
 
00:46:44.319 --> 00:46:45.670 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23.
um

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to get 100 of the
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
difference there so the difference
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
between zero and 2.7 million is 2.7
 
00:46:51.359 --> 00:46:52.950 align:start position:0%
between zero and 2.7 million is 2.7
million

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
and that transition grant is going to
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
slowly under this bill will slowly phase
 
00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.630 align:start position:0%
slowly under this bill will slowly phase
out

00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
to zero
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
so that's the the kind of phasing out
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
there's a phasing up and then there's
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
kind of the phasing out part of it
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
i think it's proposed under the bill i
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
think it's eight years but i know
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
representative lunas talked about
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
another configuration a 10-year
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
configuration for the for the phase in
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
for the ramp up
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh is what we're going to be uh is is
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
what i'd like the interim study
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
committee to to
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
work to look at look at
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
and then it's a five-year
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
phase down um mark i wanted to go back
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
to column h
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
which i think you've you've got there
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
right for comparison purposes to column
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
g yep
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
and so column h which is the the
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
current fy 23 total education grant
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't include 157 million in
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
stabilization and doesn't include the
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 30 million in
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh 16 million uh
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
oh that's right 16 million and hold hold
 
00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.309 align:start position:0%
oh that's right 16 million and hold hold
harmless

00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
harmless
 
00:48:14.319 --> 00:48:15.109 align:start position:0%
harmless
so

00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
would bring
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
the total
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
because obviously we don't have
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
stabilization in the new formula yep
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
but if you if you want to compare sort
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
of apples to apples
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
what the state opportunity grant is
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
and what the fy 23
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
current state grants which are the
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
adequacy grant plus stabilization plus
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
the the 15 million in in swept hold
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
harmless that comes to approximately 950
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars correct yeah i think
 
00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:50.549 align:start position:0%
million dollars correct yeah i think
it's

00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
954. but yes yeah yeah yeah we just
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
we're paying it out or we just budgeted
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
it so so yeah so we're we're showing
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
column g
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
that the grant actually goes down to 935
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
compared to 9
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
9 54.
 
00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.790 align:start position:0%
9 54.
um

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
and you would want to add in
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
to that number the the transition
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
uh there's the transition
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
and then there's also yeah it's hard to
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
know what the pairing apples and apples
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
the swept the three percent swept
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
retained right because you'd be
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
comparing one with a swipe without one
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
without response right and the
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
transition we're obviously looking at
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
for that to come from arpa funds and
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things we need to
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
study is the financial instrument that
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
would be necessary
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
to put something like that in place
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
and then the the three percent retained
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
um transaction
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily a school district
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
correct it's yeah it's just it's um
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know i figured it needs to be
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
included when you're trying to do apples
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
to apples here um whether future
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets have it or not that's you
 
00:49:51.839 --> 00:49:52.470 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets have it or not that's you
know

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
debatable right
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
oh go ahead yeah i was just looking at
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's mewni is that bruce
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
or you could go over that mic right
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
there if you wanted to either way
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
you're right there at the table you know
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
to your right well you just grab it yeah
 
00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.230 align:start position:0%
to your right well you just grab it yeah
right

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
right yeah right let's grab any one of
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.630 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
yeah it goes red there you go got it for
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
the record my name is bruce canuer
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
i'm the supervisor of the municipal
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
bureau at department of revenue
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
my question was just to clarify does the
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
bill intend the three percent
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
received by the municipality processing
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
the tax rates or for the school district
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
and there was that last comment that
 
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
made me ask this question the three
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a great question bruce i
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
i think the intent is that the um the
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
municipality um uh would would retain
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
that three percent remit 97 of the
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
collected swept to the to the department
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
and to the department of revenue
 
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:42.870 align:start position:0%
and to the department of revenue
administration

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
and uh and they're basically using that
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
three percent as the the cost of
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
collection right processing the process
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
if you will right right and and uh
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
they don't have it doesn't have to go to
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
the school district but
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
right yeah and i think that's the the
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
reason why i felt like to have an
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
apples-to-apples comparison you needed
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
to have the swept on the spreadsheet but
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
really it doesn't belong on the
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet because it's a muni revenue
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
source but um
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
something to think about
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
thank you but i think i think it was
 
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
good mark that you put swept and uh and
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
that on there as uh you know uh so that
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
you can you could you could see it um uh
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
but you're right it's not a it's not
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily a grant to the school
 
00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:31.510 align:start position:0%
necessarily a grant to the school
district

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we're so yeah we have the
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
transition grant um so yeah i think now
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
we're moving on to swept um so there's
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
that 363 million um
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
uh all but so 97 of that is going
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
straight to the education trust fund
 
00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:48.549 align:start position:0%
straight to the education trust fund
so

00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
10 is retained
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
you know the swept is uh it's just not
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
100 raised and retained locally it's 97
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
percent raised
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
sorry three percent raised and retained
 
00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.470 align:start position:0%
sorry three percent raised and retained
locally

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
locally
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
so that's probably the way to think
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and from there we get uh to column m
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
which is telling up the total the total
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
cost of hb 1680 for fiscal year 24. uh
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
can you i'm just trying to filter
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
through this still so three percent is
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
retained by the municipality yes the 97
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
percent then where is that going first
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
is it going to the
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
and stay in the municipality and they
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
have to reimburse it to the state or is
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
it going to the
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
state and
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just a little confused to how this
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
all works
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh chairman lada as i've read the bill
 
00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.109 align:start position:0%
uh chairman lada as i've read the bill
um

00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
the funds would be remitted to the
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
department of revenue as any other state
 
00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.430 align:start position:0%
department of revenue as any other state
tax

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
and then from there it would i believe
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
would end up with the department of
 
00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.230 align:start position:0%
would end up with the department of
treasury

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
who i'm assuming they have the education
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
trust fund funds but it would be
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
processed through the department of
 
00:54:07.599 --> 00:54:09.430 align:start position:0%
processed through the department of
revenue

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
most likely would be in addition to the
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
new uh revenue the rim system since it
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
coming in as a state tax probably
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
electronically from the
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
various municipalities
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
so the the municipality is basically the
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
collection agency yes sir and then it
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
filters up you know 97 percent just goes
 
00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.309 align:start position:0%
filters up you know 97 percent just goes
okay

00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:32.319 --> 00:54:33.510 align:start position:0%
okay
currently

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
um when the
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
swept tax is collected locally
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
it is um my understanding is i don't
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
work at a at municipal level anymore but
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
um each municipality has its agreement
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
with the local or regional school
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
districts for the um
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
transfer of education taxes to the
 
00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.990 align:start position:0%
transfer of education taxes to the
districts

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
generally an agreement where it's uh
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
spread out over the year and so the two
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
tax streams are
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
merged and payments are made monthly in
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
this case the the swept taxes would no
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
longer be part of that
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
municipality two district payment each
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
month instead they're coming
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
here to concord to go into the education
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
at least that's how i've
 
00:55:23.359 --> 00:55:24.549 align:start position:0%
at least that's how i've
understood

00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
understood
 
00:55:24.559 --> 00:55:25.670 align:start position:0%
understood
yeah

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
and i think that the
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
tricky part is and this is really tricky
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
tricky for anyone but definitely tricky
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
for the public to understand is the the
 
00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.630 align:start position:0%
for the public to understand is the the
swept

00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
swept
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
so although the swept is raised and
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
retained locally it's never leaving uh
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
the local political subdivision it's
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
going from uni to school district um and
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes community immune to department
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
within the muni when you're talking
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
about cities um
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
on our ledgers we are recording as if
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
363 million dollars came into the state
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
and we were recording on our ledgers as
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
if 363 million dollars went to the
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
school districts so that's when you when
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
you're doing a financial analysis you
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
have to kind of look not
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
what is literally happening to the
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
dollars but really what does the
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
financial ledgers tell us and that's why
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
it can get a little complicated here
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
when you talk about swap of course
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
yep ralph yeah i quit just looking at my
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
own town
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
which town you don't know littlefield
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
litchfield okay
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
if i look at
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
the swept
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
litfield now gets
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
about 2 million dollars
 
00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:31.190 align:start position:0%
about 2 million dollars
okay

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
so that's going to disappear you're only
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
going to get to keep 56 58 million 58
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
000 of that but the total
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
net change in p
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
is 1.2 million so actually
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
and we were getting eight i mean
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
1680 gives us eight we're getting 7.4
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
now so
 
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
looks like we're getting a net loss
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
because the swept we were getting 2
 
00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:01.109 align:start position:0%
because the swept we were getting 2
million

00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah go ahead the the positive
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
there is you're getting 1.2 million more
 
00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.829 align:start position:0%
there is you're getting 1.2 million more
um

00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
so when you're you're your 2024 current
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
law includes 100 of the swept so that
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.599 --> 00:57:21.190 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's the tricky part is
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
because swept is raised and retained
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
locally but on our ledgers we're saying
 
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
it's 100 the state gave it to you
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
what what what mark said uh is is
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
reflected on the the education trust
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
fund ledger in the kafir as well you can
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
see this the 363
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh put in there even though technically
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
it never runs through the treasury
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
currently so yeah our financial reports
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
will not i'm trying to think i guess
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
maybe yeah i guess they will change
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
because the three percent yeah i don't
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
know i can't speak to that actually i
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
don't know we'll do our financial
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
reports under this bill but
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
there'll be some
 
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
potentially some change
 
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:09.829 align:start position:0%
potentially some change
okay

00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
have you walked through everything in
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the that's the uh we have
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
the column n is 24 current law we have
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh column m is the
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
proposed 24.
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
um i guess i'll just add another thing
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
and i know um
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
this is just fiscal year 24 so there's a
 
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.270 align:start position:0%
this is just fiscal year 24 so there's a
phase

00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
phase
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
i'll call i'm calling it phase up
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
because it's going to go up that's the
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
standard as you go from 70 percent of
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
your adjusted annual foundation
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget to 74 to 78 percent
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
that's going to increase the standard of
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
which the state is going to be obligated
 
00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:48.789 align:start position:0%
which the state is going to be obligated
to

00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
so uh if if you hold ev constant it's
 
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:52.710 align:start position:0%
so uh if if you hold ev constant it's
the

00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
the cost is going to be more expensive
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh but ev uh uh could rise with that
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh if property values continue to go up
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
um we're talking 10 years here and i
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
think one of the conversations we were
 
00:59:04.319 --> 00:59:06.309 align:start position:0%
think one of the conversations we were
having

00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
last week was a 10-year analysis is
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
tough to do
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's the department's comfortable the
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
department's been historically
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable projecting out adm
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
even now with the pandemic it's a little
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
hard to do
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
a lot a lot of moving parts a lot of
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
variables there's a lot of variables in
 
00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:24.470 align:start position:0%
variables there's a lot of variables in
this

00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
um but if i were to do a 25 analysis
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
you know i could do a 25 analysis uh 26
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
analysis 27 analysis but it's a it's a
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
matter of what you do with those
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
variables so what do you do with those
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
adm variables over a 10-year period what
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
do you do with the equalized valuation
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
variables over a 10-year period um that
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
would provide a clear picture on the
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
full scope of the bill of course
 
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.270 align:start position:0%
full scope of the bill of course
um

00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
but i guess i haven't um
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
decided on or talked to my bosses at
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
least on you know what is the department
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
willing to to go out go on a limb and
 
00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:56.309 align:start position:0%
willing to to go out go on a limb and
say

00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
this is what adm might look like 10
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
years from now this is what this bill
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
might look like so i'm a little hesitant
 
01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.670 align:start position:0%
might look like so i'm a little hesitant
to

01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
to do any analysis that would go 10
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
years out
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
just because i know it's it's it's
 
01:00:08.319 --> 01:00:10.230 align:start position:0%
just because i know it's it's it's
challenging

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
challenging
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
but it definitely is as you guys study
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
this as everyone the committee studies
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
this that's that needs to be
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
thought about of course that the tenure
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
the future uh the future very how the
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
variables will look in the future i
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
think that's important to consider
 
01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.150 align:start position:0%
think that's important to consider
um

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
but it's you know it's obviously a
 
01:00:25.359 --> 01:00:26.309 align:start position:0%
but it's you know it's obviously a
challenge

01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
01:00:26.319 --> 01:00:28.950 align:start position:0%
challenge
um

01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's the and then i think um to talk a
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
little bit about where the the lba is at
 
01:00:33.839 --> 01:00:34.950 align:start position:0%
little bit about where the the lba is at
um

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
i i did my analysis and i think it still
 
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
might be still be reviewing being
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
reviewed internally uh but i think it
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
will eventually get its way to the lba
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
and the lba will publish what they
 
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.270 align:start position:0%
and the lba will publish what they
publish

01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
publish
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
of course they'll um
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
i don't know what that will be
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
but the lba could um
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
we'll take a peek at this of course and
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
they'll give their their
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
publish their fn um
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
but other than that i think that's
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's all i wanted to share with the
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
committee out if there's any
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
other things you want me to go through
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
or discuss just
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
the phase up
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
which i don't know whether it's eight
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
years or ten years or
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
eight years here and you're thinking ten
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
but then the
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
the transition grant phase out is five
 
01:01:17.839 --> 01:01:19.349 align:start position:0%
the transition grant phase out is five
years

01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:01:19.359 --> 01:01:20.150 align:start position:0%
years
um

01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
do those two
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh columns
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
have to be similar or you know like if
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a 10-year phase up
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
from the 70
 
01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.990 align:start position:0%
from the 70
percent

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
going up by four or four or four
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
or in in the phase
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
down in terms of the transitional grant
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
is going to be going quicker
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
so what's it going to look like in your
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
6 7 8 after the
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
phase down
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
so it
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
yeah that's interesting so i can't tell
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
you uh i mean representative luna has
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
like he has some longer term models that
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
he's looked at but as far as my looking
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
at it i have not done a six-year
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
analysis but i'm just doing i did do a
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
quick 25 analysis
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
and we were talking last week as far as
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
there's some transition talents but as
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
soon as you have a 70
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
adjustment as soon as you go to a 74
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
adjustment you eliminate transition
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
towns so
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
as you're ramping that up the need to
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
have transition towns is going to
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
disappear inherently so yeah i don't
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
know what it looks like as far as the
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
numbers but um as you're ramping up
 
01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
phasing up um the need for transition
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
towns is going to slowly disappear and
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
disappear disappear
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
some of those bubble towns like bedford
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
might be a bubble bedford's kind of a
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
bubble town in 24 but they're not a
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
bubble town anymore in 25 and
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
and they'll be getting a larger state
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
grant and they'll be further removed
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
from being a transition town
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
as the ramp up occurs but there's some
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
towns that will um
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh always be transition towns until the
 
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
then what happens after it faces out and
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
then then they'll
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
they will not they'll they'll get their
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
three percent swept that's that's
 
01:03:04.559 --> 01:03:05.829 align:start position:0%
three percent swept that's that's
essentially

01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
and and you know i'm talking
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
theoretically i'm not like um i imagine
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
some towns here have really high five
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
dollar ev rates um
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
so unless they get a lot of kids in
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
their community and have a high
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
need for an annual foundation
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
their ev is going to exceed that
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know we're talking about 240 towns
 
01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some towns where
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
their ev's always going to exceed their
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
demand to educate at that uh at that
 
01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:34.309 align:start position:0%
demand to educate at that uh at that
level

01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
all right uh are there other now we've
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
just gone through this again for for
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
ralph and for us too you know it's i've
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
learned some as we've gone through the
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
second time probably the third time
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
might be the charm
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
just i'm looking over at the chartered
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
public schools and how that works and
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's referencing a section of law 198
 
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.349 align:start position:0%
it's referencing a section of law 198
41e

01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
41e
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
which i can't find in the book and i'm
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
wondering if that's just a typo
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a yellow book okay i was going
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.589 align:start position:0%
to look at
this

01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:04:15.599 --> 01:04:17.670 align:start position:0%
this
198

01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
198
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
41e that's a new section in the uh in
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's not in the yellow book no no it's a
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
new section in in 1680 is it the study
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
committee or yeah yeah it's the study
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
committee section yeah so it's a new
 
01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.390 align:start position:0%
committee section yeah so it's a new
section

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
okay and and there was one other
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
question that i had i know this is
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
financing for
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
um and and we're treating charter
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
schools a little bit differently
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion or
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
what about
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
efas and things like that how that
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
and what money is going to follow the
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
child well be in accordance with your
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
your will it go like the charter schools
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
will it be that money that goes follows
 
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
the child is that what you're i don't
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
i would have to think of that that's
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
that's something that this bill
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
contemplates needs needs additional
 
01:05:18.319 --> 01:05:19.349 align:start position:0%
contemplates needs needs additional
study

01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
and so that's what the um that's what
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
the section that you referred to does
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
that would apply to all per pupil um you
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
it's page 14. also may i think when
 
01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
we're looking at like a 10-year plan i
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
think a lot of school districts and will
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
10-year reduction
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
in school population so that that's
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
something also need to look at and how
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
that will decrease the amount of money
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
the schools are getting and they still
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
have bonds to pay off and that kind of
 
01:05:56.799 --> 01:05:57.589 align:start position:0%
have bonds to pay off and that kind of
thing

01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's uh i don't have charts
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
and graphs but i'll try to use my hands
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
but one of the things we're talking
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
about is that that standard
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh the benchmark that the state must
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
must achieve if we have declining
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
student populations that standard is
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
going to be cheaper and cheaper and
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
cheaper and then if ev rates go up it's
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
going to be the state grant is going to
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
decrease so yeah there's a lot of moving
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
parts a lot of variables to think about
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
regarding this part right here the
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and the costs associated
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
i i don't have a question but i do have
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
a comment and that is i'm gonna i'm
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
gonna keep beating this
 
01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:42.230 align:start position:0%
gonna keep beating this
drum

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
drum
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
and that is that when we get to the
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
point where we're explaining how this
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
works to the public
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
that we offer an explanation that people
 
01:06:57.150 --> 01:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
are comfortable that there is
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
transparency and that they can actually
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
wrap their heads around why this is a
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
really good thing
 
01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:06.950 align:start position:0%
really good thing
and

01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not that means that we you
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
know have to prepare a statement for
 
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
each community and model out what it's
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
i just think what we don't want to do is
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
leave it up to interpretation we want to
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
be able to put out information that
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
clearly states
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
where we're going and what the benefit
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i think on that i'm i'm a bottom
 
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
line person
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
and that's you know that's why i said
 
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet how much and maybe for
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
10 years we need to see show that
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
but yeah because
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
i mean people are going to look at how
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
much is my losing or how much am i
 
01:07:51.119 --> 01:07:52.150 align:start position:0%
much is my losing or how much am i
gaining

01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
gaining
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
and if i'm losing i don't want it if i'm
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
gaining i want it or if i stay the same
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
maybe that's okay
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
but you know so that's something yeah
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
like you said we need it needs to come
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
out we're going to get this much more
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
but yep health for a town you got to get
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
this much less you know and
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
then you're in trouble
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and ralph in response to that i
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
mean i'll tell you that i you know i've
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
had conversations in uh
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know the problem that we have
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
funding education statewide and the fact
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
that we are these are all of new
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire's children these are not just
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
the children that live you know in
 
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunate circumstances we we own all
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
of these kids
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
and uh you know in to in credit to my
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
community a lot of those conversations
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
people have said
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
if i know where my money is going
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
then i'm willing to shell it out so you
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
know when we're looking at five dollars
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
per thousand or whatever i you know i
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
just i think that we need to be clear
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
that you know you're gonna you're gonna
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
write a check if it you know that it's
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
going to help grandma in the nursing
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
home you're going to write a check if
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
that it's going to make a qualitative
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
difference to
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
students in manchester you know our our
 
01:09:16.799 --> 01:09:18.149 align:start position:0%
students in manchester you know our our
neighbors

01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
but i think we need to be you know we
 
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
just need to be upfront about
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
what the costs are and
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
our responsibility constitutionally to
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
the entire state of new hampshire's
 
01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:32.950 align:start position:0%
the entire state of new hampshire's
children

01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
and uh i can't you know i can't say that
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
enough that we are responsible for all
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
right and i think for towns that
 
01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.789 align:start position:0%
right and i think for towns that
are

01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
have a big problem where they're not
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
spending that much on schools now
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
because they're rich and whatnot they
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
won't have a problem but towns that are
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
heavily taxed
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
like litchfield and other towns that
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
other than residents that's pretty much
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
it because there's no roads for
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
businesses so they don't have an
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
industrial base
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
those towns you know hey
 
01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
i want to see
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
how is it benefiting me because i'm
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
already paying a high amount of taxes
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
and for example have to compare to
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
bedford where you have an industry and
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
commercial and whatnot would help with
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
your tax base but we don't have any of
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
that in litfield and a lot of other
 
01:10:27.669 --> 01:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
small towns even hollis for example but
 
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
they have they have another problem but
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
any but towns that are rich that won't
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
have a problem with what you're saying
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
the towns that aren't
 
01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.709 align:start position:0%
the towns that aren't
however

01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
ralph you can trust the fact that i will
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
hear a lot about this i don't care what
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
the per capita income is i will hear a
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
lot about the cost of education
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean
 
01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:53.830 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean
hey

01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
hey
 
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
if what we do for new hampshire we do
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
for all of us
 
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
all of us i mean manchester nashua the
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
larger cities litchfield i don't care
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
what community you're in
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
what we do for new hampshire we do for
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
the the other component in jumping away
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
from the spreadsheet that has always
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
been a concern to me and represent luno
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
has heard me say this before
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
is that we're
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
trying to develop a
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
an average cost per student and get this
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
performance outcome that we're looking
 
01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.750 align:start position:0%
performance outcome that we're looking
for

01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
from our doe 25 form
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
the only form which we have that comes
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
in from a school district defining what
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
their expenses are
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
what their revenues are
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
and what their assets are
 
01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:47.990 align:start position:0%
and what their assets are
the

01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.550 align:start position:0%
the
expenses

01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.830 align:start position:0%
expenses
include

01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
items which may not be part of an
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
so in defining
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
what that
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
objective we have that performance
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
outcome yes we've said that oh yes we've
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
always rated in the top four or five
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
states in the country so we must be
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
doing something right in terms of
 
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.070 align:start position:0%
doing something right in terms of
achievement

01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
but i'm also concerned that there may be
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
include items included in there like
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
athletics which have nothing to do with
 
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.709 align:start position:0%
athletics which have nothing to do with
adequacy

01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
or there may be some issues tied to
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
negotiated contracts labor agreements
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
which are just
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
different throughout this state
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
which may not be relative to
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
all of adequacy
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
so i've asked the department many times
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
is there any way we can break out what
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
is adequacy out of that doe form and
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
find out okay here's what the goal is
 
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
now what we've got is that we're going
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
to have in some cases some students are
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
going to be paid
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to receive or
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
districts for that student well over 37
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars if you include in that
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
sixty five hundred if you include the
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
four point two nine times the
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
the the sixty five hundred add it all
 
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.030 align:start position:0%
the the sixty five hundred add it all
together

01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
um and if they qualify in other areas
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to add up
 
01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:21.110 align:start position:0%
it's going to add up
so

01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
so that that's that that's sort of a
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
sideways bar from with the doe i think
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
that needs to be broken down better for
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
us so we can see
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
what the cost of adequacy are
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
um and then the second part that i would
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
question is that i'm not necessarily
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
sold on the weighted factors
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
across the board for some of those items
 
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
in differentiated type a categories
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
the 4.29 i've hollered about that and
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
hollered about it
 
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
sure there are some students which are
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
probably needing more than that
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
but for a student who has a half hour
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
speech a week
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
why do they need that additional
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
twenty seven thousand dollars
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
not why don't we weight it according to
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
the handicapping category
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
and i meant to bring the sheet that i
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
have that there's a report that doe does
 
01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
have on they know the numbers of kids
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
associated with various categories of
 
01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:26.149 align:start position:0%
associated with various categories of
disability

01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
so uh um
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
those are two areas that really to me an
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
interim study is going to have to
 
01:14:32.159 --> 01:14:33.430 align:start position:0%
interim study is going to have to
address

01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
so no no just put
 
01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:42.630 align:start position:0%
so no no just put
yeah

01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
rick i think i think you're right um on
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
on both the uh the the um
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
the ability to um to to maybe look at a
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
at a more granularly defined um
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
classifications for special education
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
and and associate costs uh given the
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
severity and need i don't know
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
maybe we'd have this well right right
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
right now they're all in one it's all
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
because that's the data that we had from
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
the department um
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
because all for except one year
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
that uh that data was um was i'm
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
forgetting the term um
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
not not released in the uh
 
01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
well because it probably was um we
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
probably didn't have all the 180
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
districts in probably was maybe maybe
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
when you asked for it it wasn't
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
completely finalized no no i think it
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
was from the the special education
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
classifications because some districts
 
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
have less most districts have less than
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
to hide someone's identity to hide out
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
yeah well you don't even you want you
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
want to even hide the
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't even produce the
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:15:58.630 --> 01:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
the um the disaggregated counts
 
01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.750 align:start position:0%
the um the disaggregated counts
um

01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
because for some districts it may only
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
be a one or two students and essentially
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
identify that that that student
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know and and the
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with that
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
particular student so so i think the
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
department has tended to provide
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
aggregated data so all student iep
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
counts um by district and those that go
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
over the um the
 
01:16:24.719 --> 01:16:25.910 align:start position:0%
over the um the
uh

01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
what is it three and a half times and
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
ten times the average per pupil costs um
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
to quan to qualify for the categorical
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
special education
 
01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:35.990 align:start position:0%
special education
aid

01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
aid
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
but but so when this analysis was done
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
two years ago that's what that's the
 
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
data that that that we had to work with
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
without having a confidentiality
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
agreement in place with the department
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to work with confidential
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
data student specific data
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
so so from a transformer from a
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
from a
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
calculation standpoint i agree with rick
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
from a transparency standpoint i like
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
what was done that we worked with
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
publicly available data so that
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
everybody could see how how it was um
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
how it was used but it may not have the
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
level of specificity that that rick is
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
talking about here and i think that's
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
something that we should
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
um uh you know consider during during
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
interim study the other thing that i
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have to
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
address during interim study is um
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
is the the potential
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
to move away from uh free and reduced
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
price lunch to uh towards that the the
 
01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.950 align:start position:0%
price lunch to uh towards that the the
medicaid

01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
and i forget if it was eligibility or
 
01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.709 align:start position:0%
and i forget if it was eligibility or
enrollment

01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:17:44.719 --> 01:17:46.149 align:start position:0%
enrollment
data

01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
as a as a as a factor
 
01:17:50.159 --> 01:17:51.110 align:start position:0%
as a as a as a factor
and

01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
and you know how we go about uh doing
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
doing that and
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
and in both those both those things
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
would play into the um the adm formula
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh on um on page four
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
so i i absolutely agree um well those
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
are the i agree on the medicaid too that
 
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's uh umberger's looking at right
 
01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
now and i think that's you know an
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
important thing to look at is there
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
another way of gathering poverty
 
01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.270 align:start position:0%
another way of gathering poverty
information

01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.149 align:start position:0%
information
um

01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
and you know i understand that much of
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
what was done we were limited by the
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
department and what kind of information
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
was available at the department we know
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
what attendance is we know all those
 
01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.189 align:start position:0%
what attendance is we know all those
categories

01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
categories
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh and we know achievement but uh uh
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
there there there are some categories
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
which just they don't don't collect the
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
information you know i'd be interested
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
in a thing like geographically isolated
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
schools the cost of doing business in
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
those schools is extremely high you
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
can't afford a contracted service and
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
speech or a physical therapy you have to
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
draw it out of concord and nobody's
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
paying that transportation other than
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
the local district to get that
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
contracted service up
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
so uh there are formulas throughout this
 
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
country that do give some weight to to
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
schools like that we're not quite the
 
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
same as maine where you have
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
geographically isolated schools out in
 
01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.189 align:start position:0%
geographically isolated schools out in
islands

01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
islands
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
and and you have to transport different
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
ways that's obviously a horrendous cost
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
but we do have you know if you're
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
sitting here in concord today
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
and drive up north you're going to find
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
the price of a gallon of gasoline a
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
whole lot different uh there than you
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
are here it's going to be much more
 
01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.110 align:start position:0%
are here it's going to be much more
expensive

01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
even though schools may get it on the
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
government buy at the local dot
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
shed but they're they're the cost of
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
doing this for everything else is very
 
01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:38.870 align:start position:0%
doing this for everything else is very
high

01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
high
 
01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.630 align:start position:0%
high
so

01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
just you know
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
we can't do much about that we've tried
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
geographically isolated legislation in
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
the past
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
small schools
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
and then of course i've had certain
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
senators say well we're going to just do
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
the same thing down in manchester we're
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
going to make all small schools so we
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:58.960 --> 01:19:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you can win on any of
 
01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.990 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you can win on any of
that

01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
guess those were my my concern areas
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
that primarily the doe 25 and the wayne
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
categories especially for the sped
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah and and and i think what
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know again before before i think we
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
looking at weights and remember the
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
weights are basically to uh you know to
 
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
basically have a um
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
have a a formula approach to arriving at
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
those foundation opportunity budgets
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
which were calculated using a
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
statistical analysis so that we didn't
 
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
have to do it
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
so there that's like the balloon you
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
push it in here it comes out over here
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
no no it's it's not so the weight the
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
statistical analysis actually gives you
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
the foundation opportunity the budgets
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
the weights are just a way of arriving
 
01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
at those numbers in a in a simple
 
01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.830 align:start position:0%
at those numbers in a in a simple
algebraic

01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
algebraic
 
01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:56.790 align:start position:0%
algebraic
method

01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
method
 
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
and as opposed to a real complicated
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
analysis so so if you if you take
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
exception with the weights
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
you're basically taking exception with
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
the the foundation opportunity budgets
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
that were calculated from a statistical
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
method because if you change the weights
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
now you're departing from
 
01:21:14.639 --> 01:21:15.830 align:start position:0%
now you're departing from
from

01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know from from what was what was
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
estimated to be the budget for a school
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
district to provide an adequate
 
01:21:23.199 --> 01:21:24.790 align:start position:0%
district to provide an adequate
education

01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh which is defined in the bill
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
for uh for students to be able to
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
achieve a statewide um uh outcome i
 
01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
understand that yeah yeah my concern
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
though is that in looking at the weights
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
and you're we're talking about something
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit different than the actual
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
weight of you know 4.29 uh we're talking
 
01:21:44.239 --> 01:21:45.110 align:start position:0%
weight of you know 4.29 uh we're talking
about

01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
if in fact it's 1.2 here and 4.29 here
 
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
and all over somewhere along the way
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
we've got to come out with that
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
foundational budget and when you start
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
messing away here you're going to impact
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
the weight somewhere else
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's and and so
 
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that by having a weight so
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
high and special i as a superintendent
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
say i know how to make some money here
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
you know the the kids which are on
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
monitor or the kids that are the 15
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
minutes per week i'm going to have more
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
of them i'm going to have my speech
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
pathologists and speech pathologists
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
don't like to do this they don't like to
 
01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:20.790 align:start position:0%
don't like to do this they don't like to
identify

01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
identify
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
so early in the game before
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
you know the muscle development has
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
really been developed
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
everybody in this state comes in with an
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
r problem
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
sort of linked with massachusetts but
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
you could identify this stuff and you
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
could really jack up the revenues coming
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
in your district very quickly
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
by just identifying 10 or 20 more kids
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
which have the speech issues
 
01:22:43.199 --> 01:22:44.390 align:start position:0%
which have the speech issues
and

01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's good this is going to happen you
 
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
know i was talking to a daughter of mine
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
who is a speech pathologist in another
 
01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:50.790 align:start position:0%
who is a speech pathologist in another
state

01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
and she indicated today to me as i'm
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
driving down the road that her speech
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
loads increased over 200 percent since
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
this pandemic
 
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
based upon
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
well you know you're not seeing the
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
mouth characteristics the kids aren't
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
mimicking what the teacher mullen over
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
here is teaching or teacher porter and
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
so it is going to create
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
a high demand for some of these services
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
and the costs are going to go up
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
yeah but on the other hand
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
a child might only be seeing a speech
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
and language pathologist once a week
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
but then you've got the kid who has the
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
physical therapy the occupational
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
therapy the speech and language therapy
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
the reading assistants the math
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
assistants those kids
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
cost more than 27 000 so doesn't it
 
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
equal itself out i mean not all
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
special needs kids are just getting one
 
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
small service and not all of them are
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
getting every service i think we're
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
playing a mathematics game here and i'd
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
have to see how this all filters out in
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
a district one way or the other but i
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
think it's worthy there are states which
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
are doing different weights for
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
different uh
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know handicapping conditions
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh we haven't i don't think we got there
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
because we just couldn't get the
 
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
information out of the oe
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
so so rick i think i'm getting a better
 
01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:13.990 align:start position:0%
so so rick i think i'm getting a better
uh

01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
sense of what you're talking about here
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
too you rather than having one large
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
weight which could result in inflated
 
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
iep counts yeah um have have more more
 
01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:27.270 align:start position:0%
iep counts yeah um have have more more
um

01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the term it's
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
classification specific weights um
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
tied to specific student needs so that
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
if um
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
if if some of the counts were were going
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
to be inflated they probably would would
 
01:24:42.719 --> 01:24:45.270 align:start position:0%
to be inflated they probably would would
not

01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
not impact the total that much as
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
was used to capture everything yeah
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of policy and programmatic
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
issues associated with speech therapists
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
working in a hospital with a an older
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
individual that's had a stroke and
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
trying to regain some speech
 
01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
versus a child that's dealing with ours
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
a whole lot more time
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
is spent in one place than the other i
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
know there might be a balance in terms
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
of well i have other two kids and we're
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
not talking cat eight here or a
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
speciality we've got to make sure that
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're not looking those categorical
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
areas like this and and building aid and
 
01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:25.110 align:start position:0%
areas like this and and building aid and
and

01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
other areas that we we have special ctes
 
01:25:28.639 --> 01:25:29.830 align:start position:0%
other areas that we we have special ctes
etc

01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
etc
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
these are not part of this although
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
there have been efforts on the part of
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
myself and another member that was part
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
of that commission to try integrate the
 
01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
cost of cte into this
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:50.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
there has to be a way
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
because the 4.29 and the
 
01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
total number of students that we have
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
yields a sum
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
there has to be a way to have sort of
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
sub-categories or sub-weights within
 
01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:08.790 align:start position:0%
sub-categories or sub-weights within
that

01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated amount not that that amount
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be fluid we know it will
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
be because kids come and go but
 
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
i would think that it can be done that
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
if you you know met the qua
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
characteristics of three of the sub
 
01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
categories then you would be weighted
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
one way
 
01:26:29.669 --> 01:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
if you only met the characteristics of
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
one then you would be weighted another
 
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
way is that what you're talking about
 
01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.149 align:start position:0%
way is that what you're talking about
rick

01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
rick
 
01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and and if if you come out and you
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
see a savings there i'm not saying you
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
gotta ruin the whole foundation formula
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
you could also be then saying well maybe
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
we could jack up those uh
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
factors in the weights for a different
 
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
size of schools
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not convinced that we're really
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
attacking the the small small school the
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
way we should uh the cost of doing
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
business for a school that's under 100
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
kids is huge
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's huge and you you try to say to that
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
community well you you should be sending
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
your kids 10 miles down the road oh no
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
the culture of our community is this and
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
this is what we want
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
and the students will be here they know
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
each other we know them parents are
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
welcome in this school etc etc that's
 
01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.390 align:start position:0%
welcome in this school etc etc that's
culture

01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
culture
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
and you can't change new hampshire it's
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
local control first that shared
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility we talk about all the
 
01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.030 align:start position:0%
responsibility we talk about all the
time

01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
but i would i would consider you know if
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
we were able to do something over here
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
so it didn't be
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
capture the dollars here and move it
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
over there where everybody enjoys part
 
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
of that foundation uh
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
cost our money that we were able to save
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
maybe in one category so you're not
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
changing anything
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh at the total at the end you're you're
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
changing within
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
right right um but but i i i think what
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
what this will do rick what you're
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
suggesting is
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to
 
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
provide i think a more
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
detailed and a more specific
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget for every
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
school district depending upon the
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
number of students they have in certain
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
need areas
 
01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:13.270 align:start position:0%
need areas
and

01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
obviously the more
 
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
the more we understand about the need
 
01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:17.350 align:start position:0%
the more we understand about the need
areas

01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:28:18.719 --> 01:28:19.669 align:start position:0%
um and
how

01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
those that ties into the costs
 
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
then uh then we can arrive i think at
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
even more accurate foundation
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity budgets uh as long as the
 
01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
data is available
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
and uh yeah
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
well that's what we should interim study
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
is what we we do that with yeah
 
01:28:38.239 --> 01:28:39.830 align:start position:0%
is what we we do that with yeah
yeah

01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
are there any other areas that you know
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
we we asked everybody to come in with a
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
couple suggestions is where you know we
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
might incorporate into a committee
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
report that the interim study you know
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
try to drive at
 
01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:53.030 align:start position:0%
try to drive at
um

01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
are there any other areas that we should
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
be talking about today to include in
 
01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:58.719 align:start position:0%
that report
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
just um
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
concerns about ferpa and
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
student confidentiality is compromised
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
if you've got
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
those tiny little towns that are out in
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
the middle of nowhere and they have
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
three special ed kids and one of them
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
costs 285 000
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean uh
 
01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:21.590 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean uh
how

01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
how protected can the data be
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
that we receive so that it's
 
01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:28.149 align:start position:0%
that we receive so that it's
it

01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
it protects the process protects
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
we've we've had that discussion on many
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
different types of legislation to come
 
01:29:39.679 --> 01:29:41.110 align:start position:0%
different types of legislation to come
through

01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
so on the constitutionality part of this
 
01:29:50.639 --> 01:29:52.310 align:start position:0%
so on the constitutionality part of this
dave

01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
dave
 
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
where we got claremont and londonderry
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
and all saying some very specific things
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
to us
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
does this
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
meet the mark
 
01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:04.709 align:start position:0%
meet the mark
and

01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:04.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
how did massachusetts get through it
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
without having
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
what they
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
and i i know that's an original question
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
so so well i think it's uh i think it's
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
an equi i think it's certainly a
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
question for um
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
for people with uh with legal
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and uh representative ames
 
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
actually was uh was part of the
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
legal team i think down in massachusetts
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
with the department and i forgot the
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
name of the case but he has talked about
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
it a couple of times
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
um as being one of those sort of
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
fundamental cases in terms of uh shaping
 
01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
um school funding in massachusetts
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
and um the um uh again this is this is
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
from uh people that that know much more
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
about this than than i do
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
but uh given the the similarities in me
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
in our both our state's constitutional
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
requirement to constitutional
 
01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.669 align:start position:0%
requirement to constitutional
obligations

01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
for um for funding education
 
01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
massachusetts has adopted um
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
a um
 
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know a pla
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
a plan the massachusetts chapter 70 plan
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
which which does direct uh state dollars
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
to where they're to where they're needed
 
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
and that's uh fundamentally what uh what
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
we're doing here in 1680 uh as well and
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and right now you know as we all know
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the the amount
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
essentially what what manchester gets
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
from the state is the same thing that
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
newcastle gets from the state um and
 
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
obviously manchester's access to
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
resources and
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
pittsfield's access to resources and new
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
ki and litchfield's access to resources
 
01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:52.719 align:start position:0%
and hopkinton's access to resources and
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
hillsboroughs and bedfords and haverhill
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
and newcastles are all different and um
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
and so um so new hampshire's never seen
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
a plan like like this before
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
and uh you know i and i i'm i'm really
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh grateful that i think we've got the
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to move this into interim
 
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
study so that we can take a closer uh
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
look at it and and and how it could be
 
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
rolled out
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire um what sort of
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
constitutional considerations our courts
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
might uh might you know uh
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
consider when when when uh when fought
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
when decisions start to come down
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know a year from now a year and
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
a half from now so there's two things
 
01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
with uh what's gone on with our our
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
court cases which we've heard here
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
in in the past
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
i'll read them the new hampshire uh
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
supreme court held that the state must
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
bear full cost of funding
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for an adequate
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
going on the court further stated that
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
taxes levied to fund this obligation
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
must be uniform in rate and equal in
 
01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
valuation throughout new hampshire
 
01:33:11.110 --> 01:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
and lastly none of the financial burden
 
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
for adequacy funding can be shifted to
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
local district districts regardless of
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
wealth or need
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
so do we meet those three concerns in in
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
this yeah i think i think we do meet uh
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
meet those concerns primarily because
 
01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:29.750 align:start position:0%
meet those concerns primarily because
the

01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
the state's not never seen a plan uh
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
like this like this before
 
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
and um and you know and i think as we as
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
we you know look at modeling this
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
over the transition period and not just
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
over you know at year one but over over
 
01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
over a decade um seeing what that does
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh in fact for um for
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
local property tax rates and how it
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
closes the right right now they range
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
from what do we say two dollars and
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
fifty cents up to about twenty five
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
dollars per thousand the local education
 
01:34:05.669 --> 01:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
so so plans like this
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
pull pull that pull that i mean it
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it the same
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know this doesn't this is this is
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
not saying
 
01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:18.870 align:start position:0%
not saying
that

01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
that that every town and city no matter
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
where you are
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
is going to have a a local education tax
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
of 12 dollars per thousand
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
this is not saying
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
this is saying that um that
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
you know getting towards your foundation
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget you need to kick in
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
five dollars per thousand the state gets
 
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
you the rest of the way and if you want
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
to go over and above that that's on you
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
um but that foundation opportunity
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
budget is uh is defined
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
as as what it would cost for a district
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh to deliver an adequate education to
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
all of its students uh which is a
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
statewide um outcome so that the average
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
student in every district can can
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
really come as close to you know
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
approach the statewide performance which
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
is among the best in the country in fact
 
01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
it was just in
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
i think i saw a news release the other
 
01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:12.390 align:start position:0%
i think i saw a news release the other
day

01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
said new hampshire was top five or top
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
six which is right around where where
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
we've been saying it is right behind
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
um you know massachusetts and and uh
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
so you know we've got great student
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
outcomes uh we just don't have them
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
everywhere and uh and so this is this is
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
closing those opportunity gaps
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
on that point and i mentioned it to the
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
other day when we try to get research
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
from massachusetts where they've gone to
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
into a and
 
01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
operate with a
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
similar foundation type formula
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
have they been able to close those
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity gaps between our subsets of
 
01:35:52.719 --> 01:35:54.950 align:start position:0%
opportunity gaps between our subsets of
students

01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
by all those uh cultural type uh you
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
know categories right so they they
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
not just physical categories as well
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know have they you know we
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
in our present scheme of things we're
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
not closing those gaps
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
they're getting larger
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
we want to see something we can close it
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
is massachusetts closing is the question
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
is that what we can get from their
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
research well uh if if they've started
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh getting that data then i think we
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
should be able to take a look at them
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
because because they're they're only at
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
the beginning of their ramp um right now
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
and and you know and it's going to take
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
years for data to uh to start to to come
 
01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:35.590 align:start position:0%
years for data to uh to start to to come
out

01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
as a result of
 
01:36:37.119 --> 01:36:38.470 align:start position:0%
as a result of
improved

01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
improved
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
yeah making sure that schools have
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
access to the resources they need it's
 
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
going to take a while and even even with
 
01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:47.910 align:start position:0%
going to take a while and even even with
this

01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
even with this
 
01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
we're saying that it would take new
 
01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire a decade
 
01:36:52.719 --> 01:36:53.750 align:start position:0%
hampshire a decade
before

01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
before we're providing manchester with a
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget and access
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
to the resources that they would need
 
01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:03.669 align:start position:0%
to the resources that they would need
to

01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
to compete with
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
so that their students could perform at
 
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
a comparable level to places like
 
01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:10.870 align:start position:0%
a comparable level to places like
bedford

01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
bedford
 
01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
right next door right next door
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
and we're going to say manchester kids
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
you're going to need to wait 10 years
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
before you have that before your before
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
those opportunity gaps are closed before
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
those disparities
 
01:37:24.159 --> 01:37:25.270 align:start position:0%
those disparities
um

01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
are addressed
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
we've we've been at this
 
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
longer than any of us i mean
 
01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:38.629 align:start position:0%
longer than any of us i mean
right

01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
so 40 years since the um since the
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
the last time this was studied in great
 
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
detail with a you know with with
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
professionals from outside so that um
 
01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:51.450 align:start position:0%
you know 1982
 
01:37:51.450 --> 01:37:54.229 align:start position:0%
you know 1982
[Music]

01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
formula so so it's been 40 years where
 
01:37:59.350 --> 01:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
we're on this it better not take another
 
01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
40 years
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
and uh and hopefully conval will
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
will will put the state in a position
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
where they won't let the state take
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
another 40 years on it but at the same
 
01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:13.590 align:start position:0%
another 40 years on it but at the same
time

01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
it takes time for any systems to be you
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
know school districts
 
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm talking sort of engineering
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
terms um to respond to resources so so
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh so throttling up can't just be done
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
it needs to be done in a way where
 
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
school districts can respond to uh to
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
the the the additional resources just
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
and i think doing it over a decade is a
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
responsible and practical way to clarify
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
another point i think if if
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
the state tries to sell a package like
 
01:38:46.159 --> 01:38:47.430 align:start position:0%
the state tries to sell a package like
this

01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
i don't think we can should sell the
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
package that this will make things
 
01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely better it will contribute
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of non-funding
 
01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:58.310 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of non-funding
variables

01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
variables
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
in every school in every community
 
01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:04.629 align:start position:0%
in every school in every community
where

01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
achievement maybe is more valued over in
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
your district than that district or or
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
the aspiration of the family is more
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
here the involvement the family is more
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
here than over here the quality of the
 
01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
spanish teacher is better in this one
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
than over that where you get an a if you
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
bring brownies in the class and spanish
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
teacher can't teach spanish
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
my my kids were in a class like that not
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
in this state but in another state but
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
that type of thing happens
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
throughout and we can't deny it
 
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
so that we'll see change and growth
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
it would
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
result of not just
 
01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
the funding package but also of the
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
leadership and the supervision and the
 
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
instructional know-how in the classroom
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
and it means accountability we talked
 
01:39:51.679 --> 01:39:52.470 align:start position:0%
and it means accountability we talked
about

01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
that accountability has to ensure that
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
you're getting the top-notch people in
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
that classroom
 
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
and it's also we're not a factory we're
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
not producing widgets we can't make
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
you can't just retool the machine
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
and pop out perfection every time
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
because they're people we're dealing
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
with we're kids and teachers and
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
human beings that are in fact that are
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
make mistakes sometimes but the goal is
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
to help everybody do the absolute best
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
that they possibly can
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
and even the playing field as much as we
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
we're closing in on the noon hour
 
01:40:35.669 --> 01:40:35.679 align:start position:0%
i think we've you know hammered here do
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
we have any other questions for the
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:42.870 align:start position:0%
 
none

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
none
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'll just
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
rory either department that's correct um
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
i just want to say i did look up
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
last week we did talk about manchester
 
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
nashua and i did dig into that a little
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
bit nashua
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
looking at 24 nashville is getting a
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
very small grant manchester's getting a
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
large one um so we're kind of
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
interesting to look out and this kind of
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
shows you how
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
the current adequacy formula works but
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
also how this formula would work it's
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
all relative to how many students you
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
have the demographics of the students
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
and then your property values so nashua
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
and manchester actually have very
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
similar property values 64 the five
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
dollar tax
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
brings in 64 million for manchester 63
 
01:41:17.679 --> 01:41:18.390 align:start position:0%
brings in 64 million for manchester 63
million

01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
for nashua so pretty much the same
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
minimum contribution there but when you
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
look at manchester manchester we know as
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
a larger city than nashua
 
01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
they have two thousand more kids two
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
thousand more f r kids 650 more sped
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
kids so when you have that that floor
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
that five dollar ev
 
01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:35.910 align:start position:0%
that five dollar ev
um

01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh five dollar per thousand but you add
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
in the tallying up all the weights of
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
manchester's kids you get a higher
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
number so a higher state opportunity
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
grant so just um looking into the data i
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
just thought i'd share that
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
but for for nashua um we know that that
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
as as that ramps over over the years you
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
know and it will ramp for manchester too
 
01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
but um but uh nashua will uh we'll see
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll see that
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
you know over the over the decade round
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
yep absolutely uh yeah so the ramp up um
 
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
their state opportunity grant holding ev
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
constant their state opportunity grant
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh will increase um just yeah just
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
manchester nashua although there are two
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
biggest cities they have
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
some different demographic issues or
 
01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:19.669 align:start position:0%
some different demographic issues or
different

01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
student populations
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
but same ev so kind of interesting
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
yeah i thank you for
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
looking at that for us we brought that
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
you want a motion
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
well we ought to make a motion as to
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
for to present to the
 
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
the larger committee
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
we did so show hands here i think we're
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
all so would you like to make a motion i
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
i would make a motion that that uh that
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
we we recommend 1680 for interim study
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
and um and while while certainly we can
 
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
we can study numerous numerous areas um
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
in this bill as well as as well as
 
01:43:04.629 --> 01:43:04.639 align:start position:0%
considerations that for things that
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
could go into the bill
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
that um that we
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
we you know
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
we look at
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh student needs driven costs we look at
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
the state property tax
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh we look at how the impact of court
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
decisions and the conval lawsuit might
 
01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:22.229 align:start position:0%
decisions and the conval lawsuit might
impact

01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
our our obligations we look at the
 
01:43:27.669 --> 01:43:27.679 align:start position:0%
transition and rap and we look at um at
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh making sure that uh districts have
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
access to the resources they need
 
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
okay yes there and you know is there a
 
01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:37.350 align:start position:0%
okay yes there and you know is there a
second

01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
okay great so we have a motion made by
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
representing luna second by
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative boom i'd also like to tag
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
in on that that with interim study we
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
won't be starting the interim study
 
01:43:48.719 --> 01:43:49.590 align:start position:0%
won't be starting the interim study
until

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
until
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
when the governor signs this or when
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's approved by both chambers i'd like
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
to also sort of see an attachment that
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
we recommended this committee continue
 
01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
moving forward and active so that we can
 
01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
you know continue maybe to get research
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
and uh materials available so that when
 
01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
that interim study does start the
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
materials are here we're not going to
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
lose time yeah
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree yeah okay
 
01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
so no problem with that
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
okay so just add that into this motion
 
01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:24.870 align:start position:0%
okay so just add that into this motion
and

01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh all in favor
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
aye aye
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you it's unanimous
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
so we'll move forward that report um i
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
think on the ninth it is
 
01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:37.669 align:start position:0%
think on the ninth it is
wednesday

01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
01:44:37.679 --> 01:44:38.950 align:start position:0%
wednesday
okay

01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh thank you much
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
for your work today and thanks for the
 
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
agencies that came in departments came
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
in appreciate it
 
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's a conversation that will go on and
 
01:44:52.229 --> 01:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
on and hopefully with some resolution
 
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's interesting um
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
rick that i found an old newspaper
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
article from when my late husband
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
was a child so that has to be back in
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
the 1950s that my late mother-in-law
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
wrote a letter to the editor
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
talking about the lack of school funding
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire and why it
 
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
was important that we that we support
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
our schools with with a good funding
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
mechanism so it's a long time that this
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
has been going on well it's like the
 
01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner report of education back
 
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
then it wasn't called education but in
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
the 1880s the commissioner made a report
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
there's nothing more important than the
 
01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
quality of the schools we're teaching in
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
and we have some schools now out there
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
that are over 50 years old 60 years old
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
and had a few renovations but we're
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
still having problems with
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
like you said the other day lead
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
drinking water letting the water we're
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
having problems with the heating units
 
01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
that have tubes and that could probably
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
heat the queen mary
 
01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:52.550 align:start position:0%
heat the queen mary
um

01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
we need some things changed and and the
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
schoolhouse is extremely par i believe
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
what you said there yeah the new school
 
01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
in hillsboro is 25 years old
 
01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:07.590 align:start position:0%
in hillsboro is 25 years old
[Laughter]

01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
shall we start comparing what we have in
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
woodsville to we had to tear the old
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
shack down
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
elementary school was the high school
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
built in 1920. so let's arrive it's
 
01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:19.830 align:start position:0%
built in 1920. so let's arrive it's
there

01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:20.950 align:start position:0%
there
yeah

01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
it's certainly an important topic it's
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
our future education is so let's
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
try to get this motion through and um
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
keep working on it
 
01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:30.629 align:start position:0%
keep working on it
right

01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we are adjourned
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
jennifer you're going to need some
 
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
reports here i'll have to write some
 
01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
my thinking was that
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.840 --> 01:50:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.840 --> 01:56:23.669 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:23.679 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
you
