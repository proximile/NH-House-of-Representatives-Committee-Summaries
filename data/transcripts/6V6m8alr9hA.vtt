00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 align:start position:0%
all right good morning everyone Welcome
 
00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 align:start position:0%
to our regular meeting
 
00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.270 align:start position:0%
to our regular meeting
um

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
looks like we have a quorum
 
00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
and representative groda should be
 
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
sitting in for
 
00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.210 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
okay

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 align:start position:0%
I need comments or Corrections
 
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 align:start position:0%
hi hi those are those opposed
 
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
all right the emotion carries
 
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.890 align:start position:0%
all right the emotion carries
and

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
it's the consent agenda does anyone wish
 
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
to remove something from the consent
 
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.629 align:start position:0%
to remove something from the consent
agenda

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
okay are those in favor
 
00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
regular agenda
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
so this particular proposal had 14
 
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
substantive comments and three comments
 
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
to jailcar
 
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
um a number of the comments had to do
 
00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 align:start position:0%
with the discrepancy between the forms
 
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
and the language and the rules as none
 
00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 align:start position:0%
of the forms were Incorporated by
 
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
reference so there's a legislative
 
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 align:start position:0%
intent unclear comments on pages 10 25
 
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 align:start position:0%
27 74 77 87 and 95 regarding those
 
00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 align:start position:0%
comments and I have broken down each
 
00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
comment if the committee would like to
 
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
hear each one individually
 
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
please sure so the first one on page 10
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
has to do with the vendor application
 
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
on the form there's a requirement for a
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
done number and for the vendor's
 
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
appropriate designation
 
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
Additionally the agency also has this
 
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
form available on the New Hampshire
 
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.850 align:start position:0%
form available on the New Hampshire
first

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
platform and so the formatting is a
 
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
little different but there's still a
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
discrepancy as the New Hampshire first
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
printout that was provided to oil OLS
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
also has a request for the vendors
 
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
appropriate designation which is not in
 
00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 align:start position:0%
the rules this could be fixed by
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
incorporating this form by reference as
 
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to laying it out in the rules
 
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
which could be addressed in a
 
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
on page 25
 
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
the rule calls the form a service
 
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
contract proposal transmittal letter
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
form but the document that was submitted
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
to OLS is titled State of New Hampshire
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
bid transmittal letter so there's a
 
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
discrepancy on what it's called
 
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.409 align:start position:0%
discrepancy on what it's called
additionally

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
some of the new members may not be aware
 
00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:56.699 align:start position:0%
there is a difference between a contract
 
00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
in a form a form is considered a rule
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
under the statute but a contract is
 
00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
specific to certain entities and not all
 
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
entities so this particular form
 
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
looked at it it is in the rules and it's
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
called a form so we've considered it
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
form however it does seem as though it
 
00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:22.139 align:start position:0%
is specific to
 
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
what sort of bid the department has put
 
00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:27.539 align:start position:0%
out what they're looking for what the
 
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
requirements are so there is quite a bit
 
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
of changes between each form this is
 
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
also something that was noted on page
 
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
seven of the final proposal as a note to
 
00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
jail car
 
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
um the department had submitted a form
 
00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
number p37 which is the first form in
 
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:51.740 align:start position:0%
the link labeled FP forms two
 
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
that despite being called a form it's
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
not mentioned in the rules specifically
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
it is instead referenced in the
 
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
definition for requirement of a bid and
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
because of that we considered that more
 
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
of a contract as opposed to a form
 
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
because once again it was specific to
 
00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
what the department was requesting what
 
00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:15.419 align:start position:0%
they were asking for and what they were
 
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
receiving back from their vendors and
 
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
it's not laid out in the rules as a form
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
on page 27 there's a reform called a
 
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
request for quotation the rule states
 
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
that a statement signed under the
 
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
penalty of unsworn falsification must be
 
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.649 align:start position:0%
penalty of unsworn falsification must be
submitted

00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:33.659 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
and the form that was provided to OLS
 
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
States this on the second page of the
 
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.589 align:start position:0%
States this on the second page of the
form

00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
but there's nowhere on the form to sign
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
and there's no language on it for
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
the vendor to sign under the penalty of
 
00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:50.519 align:start position:0%
unsworn falsification
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
on page 74 for the hard drive
 
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:55.740 align:start position:0%
disposition form it asks for the make
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
and model of the hard drive on the form
 
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
but the rule does not have these
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
requirements once again this is an easy
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
fix that could be done by just
 
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
incorporating that form by reference in
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
a conditional approval request
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
page 77 the surplus vehicle checklist
 
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
and once again there's just a minor
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
discrepancy as the form asks for the VIN
 
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
number where the rule asks for the body
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
style of vehicle
 
00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:20.459 align:start position:0%
also an easy fix with an incorporation
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
by reference and a conditional approval
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
request page 87 is a writer to agreement
 
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
form the form states that you are
 
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:30.590 align:start position:0%
form the form states that you are
um

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
that if you were check that you're in
 
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
the special milk program you cannot
 
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
participate in the program
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
but that is not clear on the rules
 
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
that's not stated in the rules that if
 
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
you are a participant in this program in
 
00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:45.019 align:start position:0%
the special milk program you can't
 
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
continue on with the writer agreement
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
form so that was unclear between the
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
form and the rule
 
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
and on page 95 there is a form
 
00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.019 align:start position:0%
called a participation form
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
in the rule but the form itself doesn't
 
00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339 align:start position:0%
have a title it's just States at the Top
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
If you're not participating please check
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
and then it has a list so there's no
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
so that was those particular issues with
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
regard to the legislative intent on
 
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
clear comments
 
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
moving on there's an unclear comment on
 
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
page 30. as there's no requirement in
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
the introductory language so the
 
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
on page 71 there is the first time
 
00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.339 align:start position:0%
mentioned a declaration of surplus form
 
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
and then on page 75 there's a full
 
00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:46.519 align:start position:0%
description of what this form requires
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
however OLS was informed by the
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
department that this form no longer
 
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
exists and that a report is generated
 
00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire first by the
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
agency directly instead therefore these
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
rules need to be Rewritten to remove the
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
reference to the Declaration of surplus
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
form and instead put in what is actually
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
being submitted to the agency or what
 
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:10.019 align:start position:0%
the agency is requiring be submitted in
 
00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:11.339 align:start position:0%
that report through the New Hampshire
 
00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:12.829 align:start position:0%
that report through the New Hampshire
first

00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
on page 82 there is another unclear
 
00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:17.339 align:start position:0%
comment with regard to missing
 
00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
requirements in the introductory
 
00:11:18.899 --> 00:11:20.150 align:start position:0%
requirements in the introductory
language

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
there's three particular sections on
 
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
that page sections a b and c which all
 
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
are missing that language so they are
 
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
unclear as written
 
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
on pages 86 and 88 this is another
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
instance of
 
00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
um forms not being listed or there's
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
forms listed with requirements in the
 
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
rules but the agency has informed OLS
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
that these forms are no longer in use as
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
this particular program is now handled
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Education those two
 
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
forms are the Commodities in lieu of
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
cash statement and the Civil Rights
 
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
compliance review form therefore these
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
rules have to be Rewritten to remove
 
00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
those particular forms from the rules
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
on page 94 there's a note to jail carve
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
which is just an informational note
 
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
regarding that the prices have not
 
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
changed in that particular rule from the
 
00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:16.019 align:start position:0%
previous version to this version
 
00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
on page 101 there's another unclear
 
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
comment because there are two paragraphs
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
paragraphs o and P which were not in the
 
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
initial proposal but were added into the
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
final proposal
 
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
and they were not
 
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.850 align:start position:0%
and they were not
um

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:33.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the agency's initial notice
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
the notice only states that that
 
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
particular section is being re-adopted
 
00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:43.019 align:start position:0%
so that it's on the same expiration
 
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
timeline as the rest of the rules
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
in talking with the person who was doing
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
the initial proposal
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
before leaving the agency
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
that person informed me that there was
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
no public comments made at the hearing
 
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
so this particular change is not based
 
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
on a public comment
 
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:04.740 align:start position:0%
um he had thought that perhaps it had to
 
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
do with some sort of federal compliance
 
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
but I was not able to get any
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
clarification from anyone at the agency
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
on why exactly these two paragraphs were
 
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.030 align:start position:0%
on why exactly these two paragraphs were
added

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
added
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
um additionally this is not a comment
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
made on the FP but in addition those
 
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:22.820 align:start position:0%
paragraphs and introduce a new
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
compliance report and the there was
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
nothing submitted to OLS regarding
 
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
what that report is what it looks like
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
anything of that nature
 
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
and the final comment is another note to
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
jailcar on page 127 once again it's just
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
an informational comment informing the
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
committee about those particular reports
 
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:46.940 align:start position:0%
stated being
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
explicitly not considered a form under
 
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.190 align:start position:0%
explicitly not considered a form under
541a

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
541a
 
00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
so that's why that there was no comments
 
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.290 align:start position:0%
 
lovely

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
lovely
 
00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here from
 
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
suggestions okay
 
00:14:19.129 --> 00:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
representative Senator Lang moves a
 
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection based on staff
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
fine representative hatch seconds then I
 
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
know which side it was on
 
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.449 align:start position:0%
know which side it was on
um

00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:38.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to comment that these rules
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
were updated by a person who has left
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
the agency and therefore there I imagine
 
00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
they're struggling to to fill that
 
00:14:56.699 --> 00:14:58.069 align:start position:0%
they're struggling to to fill that
position

00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
but uh nonetheless they should
 
00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
with the with the helpful notes provided
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
by the staff they should be able to deal
 
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
uh any anyone else
 
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
no no okay representative hacken
 
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
Phillips has shown up and she shoots it
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:28.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
well in that case you're you're sitting
 
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on on the
 
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.110 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on on the
objection

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
objection
 
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much and the next
 
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
step is the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
registry rules
 
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
okay so um this proposal makes changes
 
00:16:08.449 --> 00:16:08.459 align:start position:0%
to the registry rules there are two
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
items to discuss the first is on page
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
six of the PDF packet which is also page
 
00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
one of the rule
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
um this comment and that's at the top of
 
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
the page
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
um this comment is letting you know that
 
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
the proposal implements four of the five
 
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
bills out of the 2021 and 2022
 
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions
 
00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:32.579 align:start position:0%
and what's missing is the implementation
 
00:16:37.009 --> 00:16:37.019 align:start position:0%
of hb605 which amended the statute to
 
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
allow out-of-state people holding
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis cards in other states
 
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
to purchase in New Hampshire and my
 
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there might be
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
some difficulty with implementing this
 
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure the department can answer
 
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
any questions around that and then I'll
 
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
move on to the next one if that's okay
 
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.689 align:start position:0%
move on to the next one if that's okay
foreign

00:16:56.689 --> 00:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the record my
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
name is Michael Holt I'm the
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
administrator of the therapeutic
 
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
cannabis program and I also oversee the
 
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
prescription drug monitoring program for
 
00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health Services
 
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
which is a program that moved over to
 
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:12.620 align:start position:0%
HHS and
 
00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459 align:start position:0%
July of 2021 via house bill 2.
 
00:17:17.459 --> 00:17:18.230 align:start position:0%
July of 2021 via house bill 2.
um

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Kim for the comment um it is
 
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
true that we are behind on implementing
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:26.819 align:start position:0%
um including the the visiting qualifying
 
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
patient law
 
00:17:30.169 --> 00:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to report that rules
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
rulemaking has is underway we'll be
 
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
filing those rules with
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
um with LBA hopefully next week they're
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner now for review so
 
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
we expect a uh are we you know depending
 
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
on the progress of that rule we should
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
be uh targeting the
 
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
the May gel car for that implementation
 
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
the reasons for the delay include things
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you've heard about well this is
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
a self-funded program the therapeutic
 
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
cannabis program we have minimal staff
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
working on it
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
um we have we've had vacancies over the
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
past couple years and there's a
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
Statewide Workforce shortage there's
 
00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:09.419 align:start position:0%
just simply more work than we can we can
 
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
handle with the Staffing that we have
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
but we are moving forward
 
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
um and hopefully by uh by uh late spring
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
we'll have that in place
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
okay it would be fair to say that you
 
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
deliberately left that one out while you
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
concentrated on incorporating the other
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
other legislative changes uh it's a
 
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
different rule set um the visiting
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
qualifying patient rules impact um HEC
 
00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
402 which is the rules that regulate the
 
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers so it is
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
it is a different rule set there is a
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
small amount of overlap between those
 
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
two proposals and so the next proposal
 
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
you will see a couple of sections in 401
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
that are impacted
 
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
um but it's a it's a different rule set
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
thank you does anyone else have any
 
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.169 align:start position:0%
thank you does anyone else have any
questions

00:18:54.169 --> 00:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
all right where have you been
 
00:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
answer my question
 
00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:01.340 align:start position:0%
29 Hayes and drive sure
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
every day just welcome back Michael it's
 
00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
good to see you thank you
 
00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:07.190 align:start position:0%
good to see you thank you
okay

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
um so the other issue is on page 32 of
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
the PDF packet
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
um which is Page 27 of the role and the
 
00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:18.539 align:start position:0%
comments on the bottom of that page
 
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
okay so um this section of the role um
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
the paragraph B describes when the
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
agency will revoke a person's registry
 
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
card and it says that if a person has
 
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
violated the statute's prohibition on
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
obtaining more than two ounces in a
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
10-day period that the department will
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
revoke after sending notice and giving
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
the person an opportunity to respond and
 
00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:45.299 align:start position:0%
if they violate the statute more than
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
two times
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
while the statute is pretty clear that a
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
person shall not obtain more than two
 
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
ounces within a 10-day period it also
 
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
grants the agency some discretionary
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
Authority around revoking registry cards
 
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
including for this particular violation
 
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
so here the agency is using that
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
discretion by providing notice a chance
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
to respond and then revoking for more
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
than two violations the agency says that
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
the intent is to revoke for repeat and
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
intentional violations so
 
00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
um that's the only comment I had on that
 
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
one I'm sure the agency can talk a bit
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
Ms Reeve has captured the issue
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
correctly and um
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer questions about the
 
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
the policy that we're proposing here um
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
the department has statutory discretion
 
00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:42.059 align:start position:0%
um we have you know follow the manual in
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
terms of a shall revoke if certain
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
conditions are met
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
um and it is absolutely Our intention to
 
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
not revoke a patient's card due to an
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
accident uh and so this uh this policy
 
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
provides a due process
 
00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:00.299 align:start position:0%
um gives to people people you know two
 
00:21:00.299 --> 00:21:01.370 align:start position:0%
um gives to people people you know two
chances

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
chances
 
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:03.980 align:start position:0%
um and and the goal is to uh to to
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
enforce this statutory provision for
 
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
intentional violations
 
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
Senator again I I my question was for
 
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
the attorney again they're within
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
statute with this rule it just it's a
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
May versus a shall so that this
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
discretion is all we're calling out
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
making sure that at least as the rule
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
goes we know that we're granting
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
discretion to the agency by the rule
 
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
yeah correct the the statute I can read
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
it real quick it says the department May
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
revoke the registry identification card
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
of a qualifying patient or designated
 
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
caregiver for violation of rules adopted
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
by the department or for a violation of
 
00:21:41.289 --> 00:21:41.299 align:start position:0%
any other provision at this chapter
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
including for obtaining more than two
 
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
ounces of cannabis in any 10-day period
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
in violation of RSA 126 10 8 and the
 
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
qualifying patient or designator
 
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
designated caregiver shall be subject to
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
any other penalties established in law
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
for this violation so I read that
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
section as granting the department
 
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:04.940 align:start position:0%
discretion how they choose to you know
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
enforce that particular you know
 
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:10.340 align:start position:0%
Prohibition in the statute
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
and so by doing that it allows the
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
agency to be able to investigate and
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
then only act on intentional as you said
 
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
versus accidental
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
um or unintentional and that's the way I
 
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
read it yes sir thank you any other
 
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
questions comments
 
00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
please continue
 
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
that was all I had that's all you had oh
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
right move to a proof
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
with staff edits
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
a couple and door fixes in there the
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
editorial comments yes any discussion
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
comments questions
 
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:51.770 align:start position:0%
comments questions
second

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none the motion is to approve the
 
00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
rule as corrected by staff comments
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
um those in favor
 
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
aye aye opposed
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much just to be
 
00:23:06.169 --> 00:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
clear that sounds like it's a
 
00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:09.059 align:start position:0%
conditional approval correct okay it was
 
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
a straight approval so I just wanted to
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
make sure okay yes
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.570 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
okay

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
um so the next one
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
um this rule describes the licensing
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
facility and service requirements for
 
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
hospice houses a conditional approval
 
00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
has been filed and it resolves all the
 
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
issues except for one which is that the
 
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
rules have been expired since 2017. so
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
the committee may have some questions
 
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
about enforcement of the rules during
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
the time period of expiration I will
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
note that the statute does set up a
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
specific licensing fee so they didn't
 
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
need to have any rules in place to
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
enforce the licensing fee in case there
 
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
were any questions around that but
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
hi good morning my name is Kelly Keith
 
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
I'm the licensing supervisor at the
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Licensing and certification
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
this rule is expired but as the attorney
 
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned we do have the authority in
 
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
RSA 151 to accept that application and
 
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
renew their license annually there are
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
two hospice homes in New Hampshire and
 
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
they're both federally certified by CMS
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
therefore regulated and enforced through
 
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
federal regulations
 
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
if they're regulated through Federal
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
Regulations why are we bothering to do
 
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.370 align:start position:0%
Regulations why are we bothering to do
anything

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059 align:start position:0%
because state law requires them to be
 
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
be added to the governor's list later
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
exactly all right well thank you so the
 
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
fee is in statute the regulation is in
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
federal federal rules and the
 
00:24:59.039 --> 00:24:59.930 align:start position:0%
federal federal rules and the
um

00:24:59.930 --> 00:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
the corrective uh Amendment solves all
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
the other issues any discussion
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.250 align:start position:0%
second
okay

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
all in favor
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
um so this
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
is it was actually on the consent but
 
00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
due to
 
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.330 align:start position:0%
due to
[Music]

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.590 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
some timing with the Board of Education
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
the um the agency asked for it to be
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
postponed so your deadline is March 21st
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
and the next meeting is on March 20 uh
 
00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
March 17th so you just need to vote to
 
00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.930 align:start position:0%
March 17th so you just need to vote to
postpone

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
postpone
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
move the postpone
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
okay those in favor
 
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
all right we are postponed
 
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
sorry I missed it
 
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
all right so the criminal history record
 
00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.450 align:start position:0%
all right so the criminal history record
checks

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
checks
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
there was only one comment with regard
 
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
to these rules
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
um it's a note to gel car and a
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
legislative intent comment as these
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
rules were part of interim rule 2022-3
 
00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:28.220 align:start position:0%
they expired back on October 23rd of
 
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
2022 so the committee may have questions
 
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
on how the department has been
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
conducting criminal history checks since
 
00:26:39.169 --> 00:26:39.179 align:start position:0%
they've expired additionally
 
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
their committee may have questions on
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
whether the department has been
 
00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:46.220 align:start position:0%
collecting fees under uh Ed
 
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
505.09 which is the educator fees in
 
00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:52.220 align:start position:0%
violation of RSA
 
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
541a221 as the feasts are set in the
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
rules and not the statute the statute
 
00:26:59.390 --> 00:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
specifically gives the board the
 
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
authorization to create rules and create
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
those fees but there's no set fees in
 
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:12.419 align:start position:0%
good morning Steve Appleby division
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
director for the division of educator
 
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
support in higher education one of the
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
programs that I oversee is Educator
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
licensure to which these rules apply we
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
became aware that the rules had expired
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
on January 24th and immediately stopped
 
00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:30.059 align:start position:0%
collecting fees or applications at that
 
00:27:33.769 --> 00:27:33.779 align:start position:0%
point in my research during the eight
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
roughly eight weeks that these rules
 
00:27:39.169 --> 00:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
were expired we processed 739
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
applications and collected approximately
 
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
fifty seven thousand eight hundred in
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
fees during that time
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
we made a mistake we didn't realize we
 
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
had a changeover in staff and didn't
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
realize that when an interim rule
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
expires it expires the underlying rule
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
unlike an emergency rule which doesn't
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
do that so once we became aware we
 
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
immediately stopped so today we are not
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
processing educator licenses
 
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
we are in a holding pattern and have
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
been since January 24th
 
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
and what is your attention with the
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars or so that you've
 
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
collected illegally yes
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
um waiting on our legal counsel to
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
instruct us on how to do refunds I guess
 
00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:27.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you so it's expired and you you've
 
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
you're not issuing any licenses what
 
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
about those that need a license and and
 
00:28:39.649 --> 00:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
what quandary are they left in that you
 
00:28:42.529 --> 00:28:42.539 align:start position:0%
have to continue to provide the service
 
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
right here we are yes again yes
 
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
um we again as I said became aware on
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
the 24th which is a little over three
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
weeks ago we have 60 days in State
 
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
Statute to process a license so up to 60
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
days we don't we typically take two or
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
three days but we have up to 60. so
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're still within that 60-day window
 
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
and the districts all are aware that it
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
can take longer sometimes there are
 
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
complicated applications
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
um depending on the the Educators
 
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
schooling background they may have gone
 
00:29:15.409 --> 00:29:15.419 align:start position:0%
to multiple colleges and we have to do
 
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
an in-depth transcript analysis so it
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
can take sometimes a little longer than
 
00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:21.059 align:start position:0%
a few days so
 
00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:24.299 align:start position:0%
we're okay at the moment
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
is the short answer
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
assuming of course that we have proved
 
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
the rule today yes thank you yes
 
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
John Schmidt well representative hatch
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
started on the issue that I wanted to
 
00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:39.299 align:start position:0%
raise and that is what is the impact you
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
guys are okay but the question is what
 
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
are the applicants doing in the interim
 
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
is it what impact is this going to have
 
00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
on functioning of this the various
 
00:29:54.769 --> 00:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
different individuals and their their uh
 
00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
their activities
 
00:29:59.930 --> 00:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
yes so um to date we know we know of no
 
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
instances where this has caused an
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
applicant's Financial issues
 
00:30:06.769 --> 00:30:06.779 align:start position:0%
um there is a provision elsewhere an
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
administrative rule at the department
 
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
that allows a district to employ a
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
substitute teacher for up to 20
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
consecutive days work days without a
 
00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:15.350 align:start position:0%
consecutive days work days without a
license

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
so we only have I believe it's
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
four cases currently of districts
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
pending holding off on hiring an
 
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
individual due to this issue but all
 
00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
four of those individuals are working as
 
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
substitute teachers currently within
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
those districts
 
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
is there a financial impact to them not
 
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
at this time no if if we go past and we
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
don't move forward then of course that
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
will begin to stack up so they're
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
they're making the same amount of money
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
that they would be entitled to if they
 
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
were licensed my understanding in
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
talking to those superintendents is
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
they've worked out an agreement and yes
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's not so you have engaged with those
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
individuals in the entities involved yes
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
we actually have wording in our
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
licensure system that directs any
 
00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:01.220 align:start position:0%
applicant with a pending employment
 
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
situation to contact us directly
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
and as I say we've had War so you
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
understand that you're on the record
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
with regard to your remarks and and the
 
00:31:15.049 --> 00:31:15.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you I was a little confused when I
 
00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
heard that the rules are expired but we
 
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
have a final proposal in front of us but
 
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
they only heard three weeks ago that
 
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
realized that it was expired like can
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
you tell me when it actually expired yes
 
00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
so the rule expired October 23rd
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
okay and we we asked for a waiver to to
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
get on the agenda sooner than is normal
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I was thinking for a
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
moment that they were protected under
 
00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:45.419 align:start position:0%
549a 14-a which would mean if the
 
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
they filed the initial proposal before
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
the rule expired they would be okay but
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
apparently that not so lucky yeah
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:03.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
okay motion to approve
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you I
 
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
would appreciate a report on what you're
 
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:28.549 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
so and we have the state police toe list
 
00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:38.750 align:start position:0%
so and we have the state police toe list
here

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
yes before the agency speaks so this is
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
on our docket because of me
 
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.450 align:start position:0%
on our docket because of me
unfortunately

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
um I was contacted we had passed this
 
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.409 align:start position:0%
um I was contacted we had passed this
law

00:32:48.409 --> 00:32:48.419 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
um I think two years ago that required
 
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
State Police to create a rotating tow
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
list for
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
um accidents and such on the highway
 
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
that they have to call a tow truck for
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
in order to create Equity so there
 
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
wasn't any anything going on somehow it
 
00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
got in in the rule in in the state can
 
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
talk to it but the state police but in
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
the rule making they got slowed down and
 
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
hampered by some problems which they
 
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
finally worked out and we've got at
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
least a set of Draft rules that they
 
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
need to implement in order to comply
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
with the statute and that's why they're
 
00:33:24.009 --> 00:33:24.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
yes tomorrow thank you
 
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
um when this first came in I uh staff
 
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
reviewed it as we always do to make sure
 
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
that there is an actual basis for an
 
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
emergency rule which is limited to an
 
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
emergency that affects public health or
 
00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:45.059 align:start position:0%
safety uh or uh significant economic
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
impact to the state or its citizens and
 
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
because they've been in our year and a
 
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
half lag I wasn't sure if there was an
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
emergency today that wasn't there
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
shortly after the bill passed
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
thank you and I have to say that when I
 
00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
read their cover sheet I was
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
startled to notice they say they're
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
ignoring the law and just calling people
 
00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
thank you uh good morning I'm attorney
 
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
Dave hiltz from the Department of Safety
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
I'm here covering uh for attorney modic
 
00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
beginning who could not be here today
 
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
um respectfully this is quite an odd
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
situation I mean as attorney Morrow
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
pointed out the legislation on this was
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
originally enacted approximately a year
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
and a half ago and the factors at the
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
time that you know warranted the passage
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
of the statute that's quite a long
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
period of time you know to go without
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
implementing the uh the problem that
 
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang mentioned that sort of
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
slowed things up and actually posed a
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
significant concern for us in
 
00:35:01.609 --> 00:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
implementing the statute was that in
 
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
106 b33
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
um the the legislation that passed
 
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
allocated the costs of Towing and
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
storage of vehicles to State Police
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
under certain situations
 
00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:16.940 align:start position:0%
um that language is not in the uh
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
version of the bill that State Police
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
had engaged with people on they were
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
surprised to see that in there
 
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
and the thought was if we moved forward
 
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:32.099 align:start position:0%
under this entire scheme that that
 
00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:34.619 align:start position:0%
provision would be operative and we
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
could not accept being stuck with the
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
cost of those toes so we went about
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
engaging other people you know
 
00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
legislators again to try to get this
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
fixed when it did get fixed effective
 
00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:50.339 align:start position:0%
July 2022 it was such a very small part
 
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
of the bill that had been changed and I
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
don't know who all had the discussions
 
00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
because I wasn't directly involved with
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
the thought was that it really didn't
 
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
support interim rulemaking because the
 
00:36:05.569 --> 00:36:05.579 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of the statutory
 
00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
scheme hadn't changed since you know
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
October of 2021 which is well outside
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
the 180 days to do interim rulemaking so
 
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
um the decision was to do emergency
 
00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.569 align:start position:0%
um the decision was to do emergency
rulemaking

00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:20.579 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
um you know there was some discussions
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
with Senator Lang but as we wrote it up
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
in the cover sheet and as I Was
 
00:36:32.329 --> 00:36:32.339 align:start position:0%
preparing for this today
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
um you know really all of these benefits
 
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
the for the for the fiscal in for the
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
fiscal impacts to citizens to the
 
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
industry and also the beneficial impacts
 
00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:44.339 align:start position:0%
of Public Safety they're all in the
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
statute the statute's very detailed uh
 
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot of thought went into
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
that about how best to protect you know
 
00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
the citizens fiscal interests their
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
property you know provide for their
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
Public Safety with criminal records
 
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
checks and things like that so in our
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
opinion based on kind of the unique
 
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
facts that got us here the emergency is
 
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
just getting those benefits out there
 
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
and ineffective as soon as possible
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
um and not you know waiting the
 
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
additional you know four months to do
 
00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
this in regular rule making from the
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
outset obviously the committee will you
 
00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
know have us back for the regular
 
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
rulemaking you know for any and all you
 
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
know reasons that they see fit but
 
00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:28.609 align:start position:0%
know reasons that they see fit but
um

00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
that's the the play of the land as I
 
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
understand it and we respectfully ask
 
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
that if you'd allow this um to go
 
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
through that any remaining issues that
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
you might have we can address on regular
 
00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.130 align:start position:0%
you might have we can address on regular
rulemaking

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
have you started regular rulemaking
 
00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
um I actually don't know the answer to
 
00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
that question since I'm covering for
 
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
attorney Modigliani
 
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
um but I can I can find that out for you
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
afterwards please represent Morrow our
 
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.470 align:start position:0%
afterwards please represent Morrow our
director

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
for the newer members I just I think
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
this is the first emergency rule you've
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
seen an emergency rule as I told you the
 
00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
basis it goes into effect as soon as
 
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
it's filed with our office I mean the
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
minute it is filed there is no public
 
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
comment uh there's no no hearing by
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
Statute and the committee cannot approve
 
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:20.940 align:start position:0%
or object to an emergency rule if it
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
feels there's no basis for an emergency
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
then it can petition the agency to
 
00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
repeal the rule but that is the
 
00:38:31.849 --> 00:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
ultimately is the decision of the
 
00:38:33.609 --> 00:38:33.619 align:start position:0%
department whether to do so or not
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's a very rare event where Joker
 
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
actually petitions an agency but also
 
00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
for the Department's benefit if you do
 
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
exceed the 180 day deadline with new
 
00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
legislation you can request a waiver
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
from the director of legislative
 
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:00.130 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:00.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
making note of the fact that that uh
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
this situation exists and uh we'd
 
00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
certainly like to hear back ASAP with
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
after I get back to the office thank you
 
00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
and I try
 
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.970 align:start position:0%
and I try
yeah

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm kind of shocked that you're
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
description of the emergency says we're
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
not going to pay any attention to the
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
law until we get the rules going and I'm
 
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
not sure I consider that an appropriate
 
00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.210 align:start position:0%
not sure I consider that an appropriate
position

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
may I respond to that please
 
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:50.780 align:start position:0%
um so so it
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
we're not Cavalier at the department of
 
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
safety it's not our position that we can
 
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
simply ignore the law it it's a quandary
 
00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:02.579 align:start position:0%
that we were in in terms of trying to
 
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
implement a law that we didn't expect
 
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
you know there was as I understand it
 
00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:11.099 align:start position:0%
engagement you know with the agency and
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
the industry and the legislature on this
 
00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
bill and however it happened it was a
 
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:20.339 align:start position:0%
complete surprise to us that this you
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
know fiscal impact part of the bill made
 
00:40:25.609 --> 00:40:25.619 align:start position:0%
it in there that made us responsible for
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
for these costs so you know when we went
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
about you know trying to decide how to
 
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
best fix this and get things implemented
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
it wasn't like oh yeah we can just
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
ignore the law I understand objectively
 
00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
that's the effect but that's not that
 
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't our approach it's just how do we
 
00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
how do we fix this how do we get through
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
this without being subject to the part
 
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
of the law that never really should have
 
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
been in there in the first place so I
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
apologize that you know the the effect
 
00:40:57.119 --> 00:40:58.190 align:start position:0%
apologize that you know the the effect
of

00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
how the department chose to handle this
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
you know could be seen objectively as
 
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
ignoring the law but I can assure you
 
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
that that was not
 
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
how we approached it intent wise
 
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator gray uh certainly by
 
00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:14.579 align:start position:0%
your statement you talked about the
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
money and I also sit on fiscal and if
 
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
had you come to fiscal and said okay I
 
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
had this law I need to implement it
 
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
okay at least you would have gotten the
 
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:29.220 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee to say no we're not
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
going to spend the money right now and
 
00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
you would have been off the hook but
 
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
right now you are on the hook and I
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
think that at least the letter should
 
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
come from us or from the attorneys here
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
that say that your your reason for the
 
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
ignoring the law is uh
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
at least justify it in some means or
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other comments
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
questions yes sir Senator so so the
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
other thing I again one of the
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
conversations we had when I met with I
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
met with director Edwards
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
um and and and the lieutenant and the
 
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
conversation was around the motoring
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
public and safety of the motoring public
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
and having the ability to know who's
 
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
showing up as well as the rotation you
 
00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:17.579 align:start position:0%
know in law enforcement that's always as
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
a former cop that's always been an issue
 
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
in local communities that who you call
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
for a tow and do the cop call his best
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
buddies he have a rotation that all
 
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
businesses are able to get a part of
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
that business and so that was the
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
reasoning around some of this Lo this
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
law so I I do think that this is in the
 
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
best interest of the citizens and there
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
is a good reason to move it forward now
 
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
and not wait another six months while
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
the rule making process is going on that
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
we should allow this this to happen to
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
protect our motor in public
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would like to say that
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not I understand that concern I am
 
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
more concerned with their statement
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
saying division is utilizing tow
 
00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
businesses that have not been vetted as
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
required under the applicable statutes
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
that's of significant concern
 
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
director mortal if you could draft a
 
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
letter from from the committee saying
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
that that we're concerned about this
 
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
partly on the grounds that Senator gray
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
brought up and partly that they appear
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
not to be following the law is
 
00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:23.339 align:start position:0%
okay I'll do that and then forward it to
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
nothing much else we can do with that
 
00:43:30.119 --> 00:43:31.849 align:start position:0%
nothing much else we can do with that
one

00:43:31.849 --> 00:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
I think someone else was just to make a
 
00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.050 align:start position:0%
I think someone else was just to make a
speech

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
speech
 
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
okay so um the next discussion item
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
um is on the prescription drug
 
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
affordability board uh back in November
 
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
the committee conditionally approved new
 
00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:56.099 align:start position:0%
rules which Implement RSA 126 BB which
 
00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
establishes the prescription drug
 
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
affordability board and it included a
 
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
request that the board report back to
 
00:44:05.569 --> 00:44:05.579 align:start position:0%
the committee on the benefits of
 
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
benefits associated with the fees being
 
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
assessed by the board pursuant to the
 
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
statute the committee requested this
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
because it received a copy of a 2013
 
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
memorandum written by UNH law professor
 
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
Marcus Hearn written to house Ways and
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
Means on the limits of the general
 
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
Court's power under the New Hampshire
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution to raise revenue
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
concern was expressed at the meeting
 
00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
that the annual assessment fees have no
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
benefit to the entities and could
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
possibly be unconstitutional just to be
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
clear what we're talking about is not
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
the administrative fees for supplies or
 
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
copying and stuff like that what we're
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
talking about is two different annual
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
assessment fees one is no less than one
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars for insurers hmos and
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
third-party administrators the second
 
00:44:59.930 --> 00:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
one is no less than 500 on pbms drug
 
00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and wholesalers
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
um so in in looking at the statute and
 
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
the legislative history and and the rule
 
00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:11.579 align:start position:0%
um the fees might be unconstitutional
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
because they appear not to have a
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
benefit associated with them
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
um to the entities paying the fees
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
um they're not fees for licenses they're
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
not user fees they aren't taxed on
 
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
property or income they don't qualify as
 
00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
cost recovery they appear to be a fee
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
for doing business in New Hampshire but
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
the legislative history does not talk
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
about the purpose of the fees at all
 
00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
it's completely silent and that said the
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
board has filed a memo which is in the
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
packet and it lays out some potential
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
benefits to the payers which includes
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
like increased transparency which could
 
00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:49.940 align:start position:0%
possibly lead to a reduction in cost
 
00:45:52.609 --> 00:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
more cost-effective Alternatives
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
available and potentially an increase in
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
market share which may outweigh the um
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
the assessment fees the memo also points
 
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
out that a statute is presumed
 
00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:05.220 align:start position:0%
constitutional and that parties
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
challenging them have the burden to
 
00:46:06.839 --> 00:46:08.170 align:start position:0%
challenging them have the burden to
prove

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:08.180 align:start position:0%
prove
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
so it I don't think anybody from the
 
00:46:14.089 --> 00:46:14.099 align:start position:0%
board is present today to join in on the
 
00:46:16.569 --> 00:46:16.579 align:start position:0%
discussion or to talk about their memo
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
but that is
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
um the the item and if anybody has any
 
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
questions we can we can try to answer
 
00:46:23.819 --> 00:46:26.390 align:start position:0%
questions we can we can try to answer
those

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
son of hatch has a question or comment
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
attention and if you stated that I
 
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
apologized for missing it but also and
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
part of this in in
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
I think most of the staff is aware of my
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
concern over fees as they come in and
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
that they're appropriate because a fee
 
00:46:47.809 --> 00:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
has to be uh directly related to the
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
cost of providing a service if it's not
 
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
um it's a tax and with this I I uh my
 
00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
head exploded about nine times when I
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
saw what was being assessed uh no 10
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me I was in the hospital so it
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
was okay
 
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
has there been any attention paid to
 
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
that because this whole thing is just
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
upside down in my mind
 
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.430 align:start position:0%
upside down in my mind
right

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
um no I'm I in in their memo they they
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
talk a lot about you know the in the
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
memo by stating that the statute is
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
presumed constitutional until it isn't
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
it's up to the parties to challenge it
 
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
um they just talk about these you know
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
theoretical potential benefits
 
00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:32.579 align:start position:0%
associated with the fees but there
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
appears to be no concrete you know
 
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
benefit to the entities
 
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
well benefit that's that's separate than
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
actual cost to fee car has to be
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
directly related to the cost of the
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
service being provided if it's not it's
 
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
a tax
 
00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
you are plain and simple right and and
 
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
um I think this needs a lot of
 
00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.750 align:start position:0%
um I think this needs a lot of
review

00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
I believe I I would agree with you but
 
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
when I look through that the statute
 
00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
specifically says not less than a
 
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars for these people not
 
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
less than five hundred dollars for these
 
00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.510 align:start position:0%
less than five hundred dollars for these
people

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
um they are following the statute which
 
00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:16.140 align:start position:0%
they are also required to do so I would
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
say the board is at a bind yes and what
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
we should be doing is looking at the
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
statute and saying does this make sense
 
00:48:26.329 --> 00:48:26.339 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I agree senator
 
00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
so thank you so again the other thing
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's interesting about this is that we
 
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
already charged these entities fees over
 
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
an insurance department in order to do
 
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
business in the state
 
00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
so we're charging them not only at the
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
insurance department to get a license so
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
they can do business without charging
 
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:41.220 align:start position:0%
them at this board so they can do
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
business in the state so I guess what
 
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
I'd ask I guess I'll try to make this in
 
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
the form of emotion is that we recommend
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
to the legislature that they review and
 
00:48:52.849 --> 00:48:52.859 align:start position:0%
and make possible legislative changes so
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
on that statute
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll second that that seems to me
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
to make a lot I tend to agree with
 
00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire that if it's in
 
00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
the law then you know it's not our role
 
00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:04.190 align:start position:0%
the law then you know it's not our role
to

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
to uh to give the the agency that's
 
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
that's drafting regulations consistent
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
with the law a hard time about doing
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
that but I do think for the reasons
 
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:16.380 align:start position:0%
everybody stated that maybe the law
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
ought to be changed so I have second uh
 
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang's uh motion and it's and
 
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
it's pretty clear from the board's
 
00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:26.540 align:start position:0%
response that there is no clear obvious
 
00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
benefit to the people who are paying the
 
00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:30.349 align:start position:0%
benefit to the people who are paying the
fees

00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
because if there was they would have
 
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
stated it right okay Madam chair one
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
more thing there's two bills pending on
 
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
this agent on this board so there's
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
place for the legislature act this year
 
00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
if they choose to excellent we will
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
draft up such a letter immediately
 
00:49:45.119 --> 00:49:47.349 align:start position:0%
draft up such a letter immediately
um

00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
that we have a motion is there any
 
00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:55.560 align:start position:0%

00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:57.420 align:start position:0%

Jen
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%

senator

00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
yes would the committee take a vote as
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
to whether to uh
 
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:22.700 align:start position:0%
