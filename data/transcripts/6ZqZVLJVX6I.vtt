Education<00:39:29.440><c> the</c><00:39:29.599><c> big</c><00:39:29.800><c> concern</c><00:39:30.280><c> right</c><00:39:30.440><c> now</c><00:39:30.680><c> I</c>

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
Education the big concern right now I
 

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.790 align:start position:0%

think<00:39:30.960><c> is</c><00:39:31.119><c> the</c><00:39:31.240><c> closing</c><00:39:31.680><c> of</c><00:39:31.800><c> some</c><00:39:32.119><c> facilities</c>

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
think is the closing of some facilities
 

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.990 align:start position:0%
think is the closing of some facilities
I<00:39:32.880><c> think</c><00:39:33.040><c> that's</c><00:39:33.200><c> one</c><00:39:33.319><c> of</c><00:39:33.400><c> the</c><00:39:33.520><c> things</c><00:39:33.680><c> that</c><00:39:33.800><c> we</c>

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
