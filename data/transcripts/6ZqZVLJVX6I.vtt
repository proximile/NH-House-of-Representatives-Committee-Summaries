topic uh would you mind giving us uh
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
basically a little history of the
 
00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and any kind of updates
 
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
that you feel are relevant yeah
 
00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you so um as the
 
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 align:start position:0%
senator said this uh subcommittee was
 
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
established legislatively in
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
2014 um and met for a while stopping in
 
00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 align:start position:0%
about 2018 there was some staff turnover
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
in my role and for various reasons
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
meetings sort of dropped off um I've
 
00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
been with the association a little over
 
00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 align:start position:0%
a year now and really prioritized
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
reconstituting this I think uh given our
 
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
rapidly aging population the anticipated
 
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
23% increase in instances of Alzheimer's
 
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
and Dementia in the next two years in
 
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this was really something
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
that merited doing a deep dive on and
 
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
having a subcommittee be meeting on so
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh that's why we're here today in the
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
packets in front of you I included sort
 
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
of a master dock just providing the
 
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
establishing legislation some of the
 
00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
history of the subcommittee um the
 
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
statutory charge which is listed under
 
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
membership and scope of work um and then
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
the some previous subcommittee activity
 
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that the subcommittee had
 
00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 align:start position:0%
spearheaded in the past which um was
 
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
really important and has proven very
 
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
successful in the state so I just wanted
 
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
to provide that background and context
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
and really thank all of you for your
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
willingness to serve on this
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
reconstituted committee I think it's
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
it's really timely and important and I
 
00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
look forward to the work we'll
 
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
do thank you very much and uh basically
 
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
the scope of our discussion per
 
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
statute yeah so the scope um again it's
 
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
in that document under membership and
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
scope of work uh it includes reviewing
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
other states plans for Alzheimer's
 
00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:00.759 align:start position:0%
disease um every state has an
 
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's plan ours was last updated
 
00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
by the subcommittee in 2015 um so is
 
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
certainly out of date and is something
 
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to prioritize updating uh
 
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
survey individuals with Alzheimer's to
 
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
more accurately estimate the number of
 
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 align:start position:0%

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
picking up some weeds and was just
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
crying and apparently she's she has
 
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
a advanced stage of it another friend of
 
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
mine uh he's about 85 years old he was
 
00:09:40.069 --> 00:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
just diagnosed with
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh um early you know stages of it so
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
it's you know I I know a few people I've
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
I clean for a living and so I've walk
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
into people's homes and oh by the way my
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
mother or or by the way and I think one
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
of the common themes that uh a lot of
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
people are are are struggling with is
 
00:09:59.949 --> 00:09:59.959 align:start position:0%
the fact
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
that it it's almost like a you're by
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
yourself right it's like some people
 
00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
like to talk about it some people don't
 
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
like to talk about it most people don't
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh years ago if you had a special needs
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
individual you know they were kind of
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
like hidden away back back then until
 
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
people found out that there were
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
resources and I think the same kind of
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
spirit goes on with
 
00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:24.519 align:start position:0%
dementia uh it's a private thing you
 
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
know and uh and and that being said what
 
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
happens is people suffer in silence you
 
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
know and I think one of the one of the
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
things that we we can do with this
 
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
committee is definitely make awareness
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
what are the resources and what how can
 
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
people find these resources and I think
 
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
that's the important part I hate
 
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
committees that don't do anything that
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
just come and meet I want to come up
 
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
with some solutions and something that
 
00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:54.639 align:start position:0%
you know we can legislate or we can uh
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
we can help facilitate uh some remedies
 
00:10:59.230 --> 00:10:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh to help our population and like
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
Jessica said you know got a 23% increase
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
in in the in dementia across the
 
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
state uh and I I hear that New Hampshire
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
is one of the the most aging states in
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
the union so that being said we got to
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
work cut out for us as far as making
 
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
resources and and I think part of making
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
that known is is our our elected
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
officials really they get busy you know
 
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
and they hear sound bites just like
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
everybody else so our our job will be to
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know uh make a make them aware I
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
think in in ways that they can have a
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
plan of action that's one of the things
 
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
I always look for is uh everybody in
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
this room is like hicc of a lot smarter
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
than me all I know is how to connect the
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
dots you know they put a pretty face and
 
00:11:46.629 --> 00:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
that's what I am just kidding just
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
kidding uh but I I think uh one of the
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
things I really would like to see our
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
our ways of to be being effective other
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
than just being a committee so and and
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
everybody's welcome to to add to that
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
um enough enough about that but now if I
 
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
could just get a little bit of
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
background a little bit everybody
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
introduce themselves a little bit but
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
can I start with you a little bit what's
 
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.230 align:start position:0%
can I start with you a little bit what's
your

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
story what's my story well I started off
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
as a kindergarten director and ended up
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
as the Director of an adult day Center
 
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
where people have
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
dementia um but there's quite a story
 
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.240 align:start position:0%
going on right now I don't know if
 
00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
you've heard but three of the adult day
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
centers in Southern New Hampshire are
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
closing as of November 30th so I have
 
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
been been spending my last week or so um
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
answering phones that are ringing off
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
the hook um trying to place the people
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
um it was senior class in Hamstead which
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
is the closest one to me I'm in
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
Salem um so we're trying to fit um all
 
00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:53.959 align:start position:0%
of the people from that program into our
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
program and I maxed out as of this
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
morning so I'm starting a waiting list
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
um most of the people that were in my
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
program so I was averaging about 15 a
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
day coming back from covid and my
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
numbers didn't really get up to pre-co
 
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
numbers as of yep but they are they've
 
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
surpassed that now um but we uh most of
 
00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:21.079 align:start position:0%
the people that we had in our program
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
had dementia I had a couple people there
 
00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:24.519 align:start position:0%
for physical reasons primarily but
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
almost everybody had dementia um the
 
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
population that I'm getting from from
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
Hamstead uh they're a little bit younger
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
um and not everybody has dementia
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
they're they're there for physical
 
00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:37.959 align:start position:0%
reasons um so it's going to
 
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
be it'll be day today we're going to
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
figure this out and um but there was an
 
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
article in I think it was the union
 
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
leader last I think it was the union
 
00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
leader um and they quoted a woman from
 
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
one of the other places at close saying
 
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
that um she couldn't find a place to
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
that took Medicaid um we
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
do um no so Medicare and this is my pet
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
peeve Medicare does not cover adult day
 
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll pay to go to a nursing
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
home when the time so all of our people
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
have to be nursing home eligible to get
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
into the program so all the people that
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
come to my program are eligible eligible
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
to be in a nursing home and if they run
 
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
out of money Medicare will kick in and
 
00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
pay for that but they don't pay for
 
00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
adult a so the only people that can
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
afford it
 
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
because um we were at 95 a day and and
 
00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:36.519 align:start position:0%
we're a nonprofit and that's still not
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
breaking even at the numbers that I have
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
at at 30 people a day I'll I'll break
 
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
even I I think um I hope but without
 
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
raising the rates too much um but it's
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
$100 a day so my new we have a new
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
administrator says well we're we're the
 
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
only game in town why don't we raise the
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
race a little bit I said because these
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
are people with all sign is and if
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
they're coming five days a week they're
 
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
already paying $2,000 a month out of
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
their pocket that's a lot of
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
money um so it's
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
expensive it's expensive to run an adult
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
a good Adult Day program it's expensive
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
to R run a lousy Adult Day program um
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
they're just expensive to run um and
 
00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
um right now we're we're in bind so the
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
the people that run those programs say
 
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
there's still Easter sales in Manchester
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
um which is another big program and
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
there's one out in the Sea Coast there's
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
one up north um but we're kind of in a
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
crisis at the moment so that needs to be
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh discussed obviously wow yeah morine
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's Moren right yes Moren I I I said
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
what's your story because I I couldn't I
 
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
forgot your name and I couldn't read it
 
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.230 align:start position:0%
forgot your name and I couldn't read it
from

from
 
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.749 align:start position:0%
from
here

00:15:54.749 --> 00:15:54.759 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
thank I apologize Mar that's okay
 
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm weing where talk from um I was
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
appointed to the board of nursing been
 
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
on there for a couple of years now um I
 
00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
also I teach Len AIDS and I've been
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
teaching Len a since
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
2010 and I have watched the program go
 
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
from 60 out well my first class that I
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
taught lnas the theory was 100 hours
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
plus the 60 hours we're down to 40
 
00:16:32.829 --> 00:16:32.839 align:start position:0%
hours is what the state says because
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
we've gone with the federal instead of
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
what the state has always said and I'm
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
watching them cut corners and I've seen
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
them corners
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
on dementia care and I would love to
 
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
have a whole
 
00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
section just a whole section on dementia
 
00:16:54.199 --> 00:16:55.829 align:start position:0%
section just a whole section on dementia
care

00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
that they're not there's no no way you
 
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
theory you can't you can't do it so we
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
do have and we have started we got a
 
00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:12.110 align:start position:0%
do have and we have started we got a
grant

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
last last year and it's taken us quite a
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
while it's a program between Dober Adult
 
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
Learning Center and Dober High School
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
CTC and we started this program it's for
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
lnas and it's for um
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
English as a second language is the
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
majority of our
 
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
students that have had health care in
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
other countries that have come forward
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
here with their
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
background and I thought we were GNA I
 
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
thought it was going to be more of a
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
challenge than it is it's a fabulous
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
program I thought I was going to be
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
pulling my hair out of my head I love
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
it um the back ground that so many of
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
these people have we have so many people
 
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
from other countries in this state that
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
have background in healthare and we need
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
to get
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
them that's
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
my the main
 
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
council do I call you doctor no I can
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
play one on TV if you
 
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
want you need a white cook for that well
 
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just a drug dealer from City of
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
Nashua um so couple of my family members
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
have been struggling with
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's um but as a pharmacist I
 
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
know we have not really succeeded in
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
conquering this disease we have less
 
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
than turn drugs um not very effective
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
just symptomatic relief
 
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
mostly uh what I really am passionate
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
about personally is non-pharmacological
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
interventions I've been teaching yoga in
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
mindfulness I've traveled and talked in
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
more than 40 States I do CN events just
 
00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
teaching Healthcare Providers how to
 
00:19:01.159 --> 00:19:02.549 align:start position:0%
teaching Healthcare Providers how to
deprescribe

00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
deprescribe
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
medications um I also believe in
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
healthcare we fail we are notorious in
 
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.070 align:start position:0%
healthcare we fail we are notorious in
failing

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
failing
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
consistently uh in finding out what is
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
the root cause of the problem and we
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
don't fix the root
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
cause if somebody has strapped throat
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
and they have fever we don't just give
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
them tyol we also give them antibiotic
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to dementia
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
hypertension diabetes everything we just
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
treating the symptom like treating the
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
fever but without giving fixing the root
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
cause so just this morning I was reading
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
from CNN that ppis the proton pump
 
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
inhibitors available over the counters
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
people are definitely overusing that
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
category of medications has 33% more
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
possibility of causing
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
dementia so different mechanism of
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
action so really we this is what I am
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
passionate about figuring out what is
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
causing the root CA what is the root
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
cause of the problem and fixing that um
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
medications of course that's my bread
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
and butter literally I make money by
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
selling drugs but deprescribing is
 
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
something which we really need to focus
 
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
on you said Des subscribing
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
deprescribing prescribing yes so that's
 
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
what I teach in medical schools in
 
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
nursing programs and uh Pharmacy of
 
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
course um yeah thank you thank you we
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
already heard from
 
00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:29.190 align:start position:0%
already heard from
you

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
Jess esland I'm the senior public policy
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
manager with the Alzheimer's Association
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
been here a little over a year um and
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
I'll just say that anecdotally in the
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
time short time I've been at the
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
association I have yet to meet someone
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
and share with what I do um that hasn't
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
been touched in some way by this disease
 
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
I was telling the senator that so um
 
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
thrilled to to be here and learn and
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
work with you all and and see what we
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
come up with super representative um
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much my name is Erica
 
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:00.039 align:start position:0%
Leon I'm a representative from dairy and
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
I um volunteered to join this because I
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
thought we'd have a significant amount
 
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
of time with my father-in-law dealing
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
with finally getting him diagnosed with
 
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's um he ended up uh passing
 
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
this past September but the experience
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
watching his resistance to any sort of
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of dementia Alzheimer the
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
resistance to planning the resistance to
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
doing anything that would acknowledge
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
that he had this disease that was going
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
to progress was a serious Challenge and
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
his family members we'd have we had we
 
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
dealt with the experience of not having
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
any of those sort of surrounds where
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
there might be some way to notify the
 
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
local police that I believe he has
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
dementia he hasn't been diagnosed we're
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
doing as much as we can to provide for
 
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
him but he doesn't want to accept it
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
because he has dementia and to figure
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
out how we can build more of those
 
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
supports so those people who want to
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
help but by respecting their autonomy
 
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they're able to make
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
those decisions they it's their right to
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
refuse that help but to make sure that
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
when that time comes for help they're
 
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
ready and um also just looking at that
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
whole process of trying to destigmatize
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
it because it is common so many people
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
deal with this you know we don't
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
stigmatize uh we don't stigmatize we
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
actually stigmatize way too many
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
diseases actually I was going to say
 
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
high blood pressure and diabetes but no
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
people point to what you're eating even
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
though that's not always the root cause
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
um but to figure out some way that we
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
can do that and even my pipe dream would
 
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
be to figure out some way to have some
 
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
sort of transition plan not where
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
somebody could voluntarily go from
 
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
managing all their finances to putting
 
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
into place a voluntary shift of
 
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as their condition
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
progresses so that while they're able to
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
talk about what they want and when they
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
would want to have help you know there's
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
some sort of a contractual process that
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
they could enter into with their family
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
members and their caregivers and figure
 
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
out how to have that oversight and you
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
know not something anybody would be
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
forced into but at least if we had a
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
pathway that you could choose to
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
participate in I think it would help
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
smooth that pathway and after discussing
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
this in the community there's so many
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
people in in Derry that have reached out
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
to me and surrounding areas trying to
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
get their family members trying to get
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
their neighbors you know I just had one
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
of the teachers of my kids Co-op say
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
they had a neighbor who they're trying
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
to figure out where to place them
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
because she's walked out of the house
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
too many times and they're worried if
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
she does that in Winter they'll lose her
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's it's an issue where
 
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
we need to figure out how to address it
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
and you know I'm I'm not here for the
 
00:23:32.669 --> 00:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
easy solutions because those things have
 
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
already been done I'm here to work to
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
get to the hard solutions for the things
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%

the work related to Alzheimer's disease
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
currently um built into our uh state
 
00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
plan on Aging that's renewed every four
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
years goals and objectives and
 
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
strategies related to um Alzheimer's
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
disease related dementia public
 
00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:22.039 align:start position:0%
awareness um agef friendly
 
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
language um many things that we hope
 
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
that will you support
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
and build capacity for our service
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
system um to uh help this population and
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
their caregivers and providers in terms
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
of awareness and training so so is there
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
any legislation as a byproduct of what
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
you just said that you that's that's on
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's in the works right now um I don't
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
think there's any current legislation
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
being filed we at the department we're
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
currently um reviewing some of the
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
things that come our way in legislative
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
requests um and I I haven't seen
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
anything um to date yet but in the last
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
year's uh session we did have have a
 
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
bill um that uh legislated and funded a
 
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
public awareness campaign campaign for
 
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
off that was a really good bill
 
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
so that was a very good B that was a
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
very good thank you very much thank you
 
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
hi um so I'm Kathy Harvard and I'm here
 
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
in the capacity of uh as someone who was
 
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:34.360 align:start position:0%
a caregiver for many years for my
 
00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:36.919 align:start position:0%
husband who passed from younger onset
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's a few years ago but I
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
accompanied and my young children we
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
accompanied my husband on his more than
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
decad long journey through dementia and
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
in that process navigated the world of
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
Elder Support Services the health system
 
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
and um at that point we were a younger
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
age I I was able to find out at an
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
earlier time exactly what worked and
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
what didn't work and um so I I have been
 
00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
involved since that time um doing what I
 
00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519 align:start position:0%
can on advocacy and policy and awareness
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
raising on behalf of the families who
 
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
are dealing with this and so you've
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
already touched on so many of it let's
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
just start with stigma and let's talk
 
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.549 align:start position:0%
just start with stigma and let's talk
about

00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:21.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
awareness most of the caregivers that I
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
am familiar with will tell you that they
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
some of it
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
self-stigmatizing we have to change
 
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519 align:start position:0%
attitudes and attitudes can be changed
 
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
by leaders and we're better then right
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
here so starting by creating a different
 
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
conversation about dementia of All Sorts
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
not just Alzheimer's and exactly what
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
you alluded to we used to talk about 50
 
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
years ago cancer was the c-word right
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
we've changed the way we handle all
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
kinds of disabilities this one has got
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
to be changed just by the sheer numbers
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
that we are dealing with so using keying
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
into public awareness campaigns which
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
don't cost a whole lot of money but have
 
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
huge amount of impact in liberating
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
families to be able to talk more openly
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
and as we found out now is that in fact
 
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
there may be a way to to reduce by risk
 
00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:23.519 align:start position:0%
prevention to reduce the incidence of
 
00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:25.519 align:start position:0%
Dementia by certain brain health
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
messages that are older population needs
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
but we if they won't listen and they
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
won't self-identify to their doctors and
 
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
the doctors are not pushing then we are
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
missing opportunities that are costing
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
us all a lot of money so I feel that
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
there's both a public awareness side of
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
things and I personally have been able
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
to participate on a number of policy and
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
legislative changes here um over the
 
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
years that had a direct impact on me and
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
so I know that that singling out the
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
those two or three pieces we can do
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
every year they will have impact on
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
families they will make a difference
 
00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:05.799 align:start position:0%
they will either save money or they will
 
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
save sorrow but they will help and so I
 
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
think identifying what priorities we can
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
make progress on is would be huge so
 
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
thank you the entire system needs to be
 
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
navigated more openly and whatever way
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
that we can do that legislatively or
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
through public awareness it's it's a
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
very very pressing need thank you
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
so I am um Janessa Luke I'm the director
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
of social services at Bedford Nursing
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
and Rehab Center um I started Healthcare
 
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
in 2010 I was a dietary aid and an
 
00:30:42.269 --> 00:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
assisted living in Massachusetts um
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
worked my way up and was a Bo and
 
00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:47.519 align:start position:0%
director of admissions for many many
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
years um something that happened to me
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
personally I lost my fiance in 2019 to
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
Suicide um so at that point I had an
 
00:30:56.799 --> 00:30:57.950 align:start position:0%
Suicide um so at that point I had an
opportunity

00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit after to take over Social
 
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
Services in my building um and not only
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
with my own healing did that help me
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
with helping others um I just also have
 
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
seen such a need for the resources that
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
people need in the community um just the
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
support the awareness kind of what
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
everyone has said so you know I'm here
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
to help want to make a change well we
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here thank you
 
00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:28.149 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here thank you
yeah

00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
so I think one of the things that I'd
 
00:31:32.909 --> 00:31:32.919 align:start position:0%
like to see is um if
 
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
um instead of having a book if you can
 
00:31:37.149 --> 00:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
give me some bullet points as to what
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
you would like to see out of this
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
committee um not a long letter just
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
bullet points I want to see some
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
progress on this bullet point or this
 
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
bullet point or this bullet point
 
00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:53.799 align:start position:0%
whether it's the decription or we have
 
00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:57.799 align:start position:0%
an issue with uh we got some closing and
 
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
that that's going to put a really big
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
burden so if I can get a list from
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
everybody as to what they want to
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
accomplish uh through this committee it
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
would be helpful for us and then we can
 
00:32:12.629 --> 00:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
narrow in zero in on on some quick
 
00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:14.789 align:start position:0%
narrow in zero in on on some quick
Solutions

00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
Solutions
 
00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:17.559 align:start position:0%
um I I'm sure we can go on and on and on
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
I I think one of the things that I I'd
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
also like to consider is the living
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
conditions of some of these individuals
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
why would I say
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
that um some of you know that I I am a
 
00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
cleaner I've I've been cleaning since 15
 
00:32:31.159 --> 00:32:31.990 align:start position:0%
cleaner I've I've been cleaning since 15
years

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
old and uh years ago I used to do uh I
 
00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
used to do a lot of cleaning up here in
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
the conquered area and years back before
 
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
any of your times I think being there
 
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
were uh there were some needs up here
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
right across the way over here and there
 
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
was a gentleman he had
 
00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.039 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's and uh they came up and said
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
would you mind cleaning his
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
house the swill that people live in
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
that are abandoned is breathtaking
 
00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
literally and uh I remember going in
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
there and I said okay I just SW him out
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
of the house for a few hours cleaned out
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
the entire house and they
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
said you can keep whatever you
 
00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:17.799 align:start position:0%
find uh well when you see the swill that
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
these people live in you think well I
 
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want anything and I uh I
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
cleaned the house went into the the
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
apartment opened up
 
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh the kitchen the cabin there was
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
garbage stacked all the way to the
 
00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
top at the bottom of that that
 
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
garbage was a violin now some of you
 
00:33:39.149 --> 00:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
know I like
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
instruments so I cleaned everything out
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
I found the violin and I opened it
 
00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
up I looked inside the thing the the
 
00:33:50.669 --> 00:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
violin case and the bridge was broken
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
but wasn't super bad wow this is cool
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll I'll keep this I looked in
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
Stratovarius I closed it I put it under
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
his bed I clean that apartment and she
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
brought him back and he he was okay to
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
live in this clean Environ I went under
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
the bed I took the
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
Stratovarius and I put it on his bed and
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
I I said I'm want to show you something
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
did did you know you have
 
00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
this no
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
expression yep
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
come to find out he was a World War II
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
vet I found all his medals and secret
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
missions that he did and I I displayed
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
him on his on his on his cabinet and on
 
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.589 align:start position:0%
him on his on his on his cabinet and on
his

00:34:38.589 --> 00:34:38.599 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
bureau and
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
um I walked out of there and I wouldn't
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
take that I would I wouldn't take the
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
violin it was just too
 
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
thinking he's left alone he served this
 
00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:57.670 align:start position:0%
thinking he's left alone he served this
country

00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
somebody had pity on him to clean this
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
place but his family abandoned him let
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
the state take care of
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
it and he lived in
 
00:35:10.349 --> 00:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
swill and I'm going to tell you there
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
are more people like that than people
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
realize living in the state because I
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
cleaned a lot of
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
them and most people wouldn't walk into
 
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
conditions but after a while you know
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
that to me it's heartless where's the
 
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
family where are the resources for this
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
individual um and as precious as that
 
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
violin was stacked under that garbage
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
something multiple times more valuable
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
and it was that soul that lived in that
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
swill and uh I would like to make sure
 
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
that we can at least consider you know
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
also some of the living conditions and
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
resources for individuals that you'd be
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
surprised surpris what you get used to
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
you be surpris I'm I'm sure you you've
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
seen it I'm sure you've seen it some of
 
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
you but that I definitely want that into
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
consideration um because it's it's
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
subhuman and some of some of the things
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
that these people live in but with that
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
I would definitely like to see some
 
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
bullet points I'd like to see some
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
solutions uh some plans of
 
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
actions and if there are amendments that
 
00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
we can attach to any piece of
 
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that would solve a certain
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
crisis let us know I mean let me know
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
because we're past the gauntlet now as
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
far as uh legislative putting in things
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
but I am the chair of
 
00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:46.599 align:start position:0%
WS so I don't but we can also always
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
attach an amendment to something um if
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
if necessary so uh with that being said
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
um that's your homework if that's okay
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
and I guess uh our our we're coming into
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
the holiday season so I think one of the
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
things is scheduled the next meeting um
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
and if you have some things that we can
 
00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
bring present to the next meeting that'd
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
be great we can do one more before the
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
end of the year let's uh agree on a date
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
at some point um if if you're all in
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
favor do we know sir do we know how many
 
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
how often we're going to meet every
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
other week every other week I'm kidding
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
I'm oh no I thought that was exciting
 
00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.750 align:start position:0%
I'm oh no I thought that was exciting
I'm

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
so no that's supposed to make your heart
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
drop no I I think you are you have a
 
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
room full of people that are really
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
motivated yeah and and uh I really want
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of that and by the way
 
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
I want to recognize Tom prol for being

draft the legislation that uh that was
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier and Tom and Jessica
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%

the Alzheimer's Association for the
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
better part of the last decade and was
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
here with the infancy and the foundation
 
00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:19.880 align:start position:0%

working group has put together a lot of
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
great uh IDE ideas that have become laws
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
including you know creating the silver
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
alert program for when someone goes
 
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
missing um we have worked to for
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
training required uh hours of training
 
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
um in regards to specific Alzheimer's
 
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
and Dementia which would has really
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
helped with I think uh the retention of
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
those workers because they're not
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
burning out when they learn when they
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
given the tools to properly handle
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
situations uh we worked on uh Lang
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
anguage to change the definition of
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's disease to create more
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility for the resit grant and I
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
just want to say um sitting back here
 
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
and listening to all of you I'm really
 
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
excited because I think this group can
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
do a lot of great work um so I'm just
 
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
really looking forward to seeing what
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
you all put out there but that's all I
 
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
have to say I was just itching to say it
 
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
yeah we appreciate that and uh if you uh
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
see anything uh in in in the works in in
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
the pipeline that we can attach
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
something to or uh you know that'd be
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
great and if there's some grants that we
 
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
can use for for
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
Education the big concern right now I
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
think is the closing of some facilities
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
I think that's one of the things that we
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
really got to thank you Tom uh we got to
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
really focus on so
 
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
um let's uh let's come up with some
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
bullet points as a plan of action and I
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
think uh other than that what we just
 
00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:47.309 align:start position:0%
think uh other than that what we just
our

00:39:47.309 --> 00:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
next big thing to do is come up with
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
another date to meet and we we should
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
have all that in in uh in advance
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
yet I add um to that problem
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation oh yeah yeah yeah just I
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
second that yeah yeah put it in the you
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
know in in the bullet points of things
 
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
for us to to look at and if there are
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
some resources that we have not tapped
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
into put that in there as well um if
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
there uh are any rules that are uh
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
hindering because things in rules can
 
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
have uh you know let me know and let
 
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
let's see if we can't um make a law to
 
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
change a rule because that's how we do
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
it right actually I'm on J car we can
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
always ask to have a rule changed and
 
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
then if it's if it's appropriate then
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
they can bring it through the ru making
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
process if they don't change it on their
 
00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
own then we can pass a law in order to
 
00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
encourage them much more strongly
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
exactly so that being said uh I don't
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
know if we're able to come up with a
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
date now or Senator if it's helpful I'm
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
happy to connect with Trisha and I'll
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
I'll send out another um availability
 
00:40:59.710 --> 00:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
poll if that works for folks working
 
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
with her on your calendar that works
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
yeah okay great I'll do that today she's
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
the brains of my operation that's for
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
sure uh so with that I don't know if
 
00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:09.079 align:start position:0%
there's anything else we need to do
 
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
right other than scheduling a meeting
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
and uh yeah definitely come up with
 
00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:15.079 align:start position:0%
something and I promise you if it's a
 
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
book I won't read it I I just won't I I
 
00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
just and I think that's one of the
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
things a lot of senators do if they see
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
even the longest of emails um unless
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
they are extremely barded which they're
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
not uh so bullet points are usually the
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
best way to get things done with a plan
 
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
of action and uh it's like cutting to
 
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
the chase nobody wants to Hero you know
 
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
just just get it done that's kind of how
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm designed I'm wired so um any
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
final Thoughts with every anybody
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
