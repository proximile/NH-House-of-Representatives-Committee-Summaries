1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
All right.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Good morning, everyone.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It is nine o'clock.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.500
We're going to open up the committee of conference on House Bill 1547.

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:26.500
And we have present myself, Howard Pearl, the chair, ranking member, Rep Bixby, vice chair, Judy Aaron from finance, Tracy Embrick and two senators.

7
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.500
Yeah, my head just went blank.

8
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.500
Senator Waters and him.

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500
Senator Daniels, thank you.

10
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.500
Sorry, I don't know where my head went.

11
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.500
And Senator Bradley is not going to be in attendance.

12
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:57.500
So in review of House Bill 1547, the House had asked for a committee of conference because there was a $25 million appropriation that was added to the original bill.

13
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:11.000
And the House Finance Committee had wanted an opportunity to take a look at that and make sure that they felt the funding was there and appropriate.

14
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And in speaking with Chairman Umberger yesterday, she informed me that she is okay and is comfortable with the bill.

15
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:36.500
So I think unless there's other objections from anyone on the committee, the House will agree to accede to the changes that is in the Senate amendment on House Bill 1547.

16
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500
Anybody else want to weigh in?

17
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.500
Yeah, I'm happy that we can come to this position of acceding.

18
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.500
I think it makes sense to put the money towards the fund.

19
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.000
And in reviewing the bill, I did detect one typographical error.

20
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
There is a reference to Section 2, which should be Section 2A.

21
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And I talked to OLS, and they said that that could be resolved in the bill process rather than having to do an amendment.

22
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.500
Any further comment from anyone?

23
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.500
Thank you.

24
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:29.500
and they said that that could be resolved in the enrolled bill process rather than having to do an amendment.

25
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.000
Any further comment from anyone?

26
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Representative of Emory?

27
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Yeah, the prime sponsor is here.

28
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I spoke with her, and she's quite pleased with the Senate Amendment.

29
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Great.

30
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Well, I know there's been a lot of work on the bill, and we thank you for all your work you've done on it, Representative Mooney.

31
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.500
It definitely was a good bill in the end.

32
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.500
We made a lot of changes to it.

33
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.500
Anything else?

34
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:17.000
I think we may get this to be one of the shortest committee conferences of the week.

35
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
All right.

36
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Well, with that, then, we're all in agreement.

37
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Do we need to pick a formal vote?

38
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We do not.

39
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And we'll, as far as I can then, we're all in agreement.

40
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Do we need to take a formal vote?

41
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We do not.

42
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And we'll, as far as I can tell, we're all in agreement on this.

43
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.500
And we'll sign off once it's ready from OLS.

44
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500
Great.

45
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.000
We can do the sign off by calling in.

46
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We can.

47
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.500
Yep, sign off coming down by calling.

48
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.500
That is correct.

49
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.000
Well, we thank you all.

50
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And with that, we're going to close the committee conference on House Bill 1547.

51
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Thank you.

52

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Thank you.

197
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Thank you.

198
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Thank you.

199
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Thank you.

200
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Thank you.

201
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Thank you.

202
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Okay.

203
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Okay, I'd like to go ahead and start.

204
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
It's continuing our discussion on 1661.

205
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And I'm going to open this up by asking Representative Turcotte to please go ahead and explain the amendment which he has.

206
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:51.000
okay i have not seen the amendment delivered here yet i just finished receiving it so i'm assuming it's going to be brought up here shortly.

207
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.500
They said they were going to bring it up.

208
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.000
So I'm waiting on 400.

209
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
We're waiting for that to arrive.

210
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Okay.

211
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So let's start out by discussing, walking through the entire bill that we've done so everybody understands where we are and what we have to do.

212
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Sure.

213
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.500
Representative Chircotte, would you please do that?

214
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.500
Sure.

215
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.500
Thank you, Mr.

216
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.500
Chairman.

217
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.500
Okay.

218
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.500
So we know there's several pieces in this.

219
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:39.500
We'll start off by saying that we know HB 1476 was removed.

220
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:46.000
That's going to its own committee of conference or has gone SB 420.

221
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:54.000
That was also removed and that is also in a committee of conference at this time.

222
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
We know there's a.

223
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:13.000
The first first part of it, the career technical education that we don't have any apparent disagreements on the next section was the legislative garage which originally had a $35 million from the house.

224
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
The Senate's version has it at $9.35 million.

225
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.500
We know that the speaker is more than happy with that.

226
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.000
We do not require any additional money.

227
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Matter of fact, I believe that's probably a more fiscally responsible start.

228
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:54.500
that leaves us with two other pieces 430 and 400 again i'm waiting for 400 to come sb 430 i mentioned this several times at the hearing last week that uh that was um came over after we had an amendment 1440 placed on it.

229
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.000
The Senate declined to hear that and they non-concurred.

230
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And then they took their version of 430 and placed that onto HB 1661.

231
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.500
As far as we're concerned, that portion, SB 430, is no longer on the table.

232
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:34.000
SB 400, while we're still waiting for the amendment to get here, I will say, I think we can still talk about it because last week we went through a listing of issues we said were okay, some that were not.

233
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.500
And we had that turned into the amendment that's going to be forthcoming.

234
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:48.000
Now, I understand there's three issues that possibly remain, and I will get those out.

235
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.500
Start with 92 and 93.

236
00:12:50.500 --> 00:13:01.500
And again, I'm going to assume all the rest of the amendment once it gets here that the Senate has agreed to.

237
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:07.500
I believe it's 83, 92, and 93 that there's some issues with.

238
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:17.500
I want to start with 92 and 93 and speak to why we are against those being in the bills.

239
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:32.500
If you look at them, I'd like to read, especially from 93, the piece that's being added says, acquire, construct, reconstruct, improve, alter, extend, operate, maintain, or promote residential developments.

240
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:40.500
Now, the problem that we have with that is cities and municipalities and towns becoming landlords.

241
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:50.500
We have received, or I know I have received a lot of pushback from individuals on this in our caucus.

242
00:13:50.500 --> 00:14:08.000
And the reason it's so bad, I guess the easiest way to describe it is if you go and you look at the RSA that talks about municipal economic development and revitalization districts, Thank you.

243
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:33.000
way to describe it is if you go and you look at the RSA that talks about municipal economic development and revitalization districts, before those districts can be put into law or into a municipality, that has to go before either the voters or the elected officials of that municipality.

244
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:51.000
This here, by adding what I just read to you in there, that is going to bypass the voters and the elected officials if those towns or municipalities already have these revitalization districts within their town.

245
00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:01.000
So what I would suggest is I don't think in the long run, I know I wouldn't be against this.

246
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:35.500
However, for those sections that we're adding, if we were to add them, and we couldn't do it now, but I think we must insist that the voters of those communities or the elected officials, I prefer the voters, they should have the ability to decide if they're going to add this extra section of acquire, construct, reconstruct, improve, alter, extend, operate, maintain, promote residential developments in their districts.

247
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:45.000
Again, these are the areas, those two sections, 92 and 93, that we have issues with for those reasons.

248
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.500
Now, 80, let me see if I can find it, 83.

249
00:15:50.500 --> 00:16:11.500
That one is similar, and actually this is the one we had the most pushback from our caucus on, and that was basically calling workforce housing for older persons, or having the ability of older person communities to be considered workforce housing.

250
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:20.000
Again, that's an issue we think should be approved by voters or the elected officials in town.

251
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And putting this into SB 400, we don't believe should be there.

252
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I think all the rest the Senate has agreed to.

253
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I think that's pretty much it.

254
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Thank you.

255
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.500
Senator Bradley, do you have any, we just brought up that as a discussion item.

256
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.500
Any input here?

257
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:53.000
So I think that we could agree to drop sections 86, 89, 90, and 94.

258
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
We want to retain 83, 92, and 93.

259
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And maybe, is Ben Frost in the room?

260
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.500
Is there somebody from the housing community, Alyssa, that could answer a question?

261
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.500
Sure.

262
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.000
Are they in the room?

263
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Okay.

264
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Welcome.

265
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Thank you, Mr.

266
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Chair.

267
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.500
Thank you for the record.

268
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.500
I'm Alyssa Margolin.

269
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:29.000
I serve as Director of Housing Action New Hampshire.

270
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.500
So my question would be, you heard the concern raised by Representative Turcotte.

271
00:17:35.500 --> 00:18:02.500
If in section 82, 92, and 93, we said something to the effect of subject to a vote of the governing body, which in the case of a town would be the voters, in the case of cities would be the city council, and then the authorization in those three sections would go through.

272
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.500
Is that workable?

273
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.500
Thank you, Senator, for the question.

274
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:20.000
I think for the TIF financing 92-93 or 93, 94, that would work if the governing bodies had a say, because it's only enabling anyway.

275
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:41.000
I'm not sure it works for the density proposal, which basically says that if a community has already decided so if that governing body has already made a decision to provide incentives and density for one population they can't exclude another Mr.

276
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Chair?

277
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Yes.

278
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.500
Can I ask Representative Turcotte a question?

279
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.500
Yes.

280
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.500
Well, if he's willing to take the question.

281
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.500
Mr.

282
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.500
Chair?

283
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.500
Yes.

284
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.000
Can I ask Representative Turcotte a question?

285
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Yes.

286
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Well, if he's willing to take the question.

287
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Of course he is.

288
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.500
I will do my best.

289
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.500
This is all.

290
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:23.000
This particular issue is new to me, but I'll do my best, Senator.

291
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Yeah, well.

292
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:45.000
um so if we were to go with your suggestion on 92 and 93, subject to a vote of the governing body, and on 83, if we were to add, I'd have to think about this, because I think Ms.

293
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Margolin is correct.

294
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
the way the language is written.

295
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:59.000
It's a new paragraph, but a municipality would have already allowed housing for the elderly with the incentives.

296
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000
What this does is say if you do for one, you do for workforce.

297
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
I hate to think out loud.

298
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
It's always dangerous.

299
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:24.500
But maybe you and I can have a discussion about how to word something like that so that there would be approval somehow of the voters of...

300
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:43.000
of what I don't want to see happen, I guess, is for communities that have already approved elderly housing, that we require new approval for the elderly housing that's already been approved by approving something for workforce.

301
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Do you see what I'm saying, Representative Turcotte?

302
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
I believe I do.

303
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.500
I would not be opposed to working on that.

304
00:20:53.500 --> 00:21:26.000
I won't speak for the entire House caucus, but I believe if we could develop something along those lines, that that be a possibility i'm looking at 162k i was frantically trying to find it um and again for the those municipalities who have already put 162k into their um onto their books our major concern was having this thrust upon them without a vote.

305
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.500
And 162K1 speaks very clearly on that.

306
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.000
I'm actually into the RSAs.

307
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
I know, but it says amend RSA 674.

308
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Go down to 93.

309
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
No, we're on 83.

310
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.500
Well, he mentioned the couple of them.

311
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.000
I'm speaking to 93, basically.

312
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
See, I think we can do 93 and 94 easily.

313
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
That's what I'm saying.

314
00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:10.000
And if we can do 93 and 94 using what's laid out in the way of a majority vote of the voters, I'm particularly concerned about the voters, not so much the legislative body.

315
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:20.000
But I'm guessing if there's a way to make that work, there's probably a way to make the other work.

316
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.500
The concern would be if we undermine communities that already have elderly housing.

317
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:55.500
And I'm looking, is there a representative of the municipal association in the room i think yeah while they're coming up uh jeb uh on the the bill itself where we're looking at this roman four uh the section that we're talking about 83 if, if we change shall to may in there, would that make a difference?

318
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.500
May subject to approval of so-and-so?

319
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:03.500
This is why I wanted somebody from the Municipal Association.

320
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:07.500
Do you have a copy of the bill?

321
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.500
I do not in front of me, sir.

322
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.000
Here, she can look at mine for right now.

323
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Okay.

324
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:31.500
Somebody's's gonna help you this is as you sorry i was looking at it electronically all right so we are on page 20 bottom of page 25.

325
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:37.000
So the issue is communities have already approved, presumably, elderly housing.

326
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.500
How do we, without undermining that, have an approval process for workforce housing?

327
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:53.000
If you could give me some time, I can get you some language in an hour or so, sir.

328
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
I like that answer, Representative Turcotte.

329
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
What do you think?

330
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.500
Should we wait and see?

331
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.500
I think that's the smart thing.

332
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.500
You mentioned it before.

333
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:15.500
I think there's nothing worse than operating on the fly, so I would be more than happy to do that.

334
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.500
Thank you.

335
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.500
Okay.

336
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.000
Thank you very much, Catherine.

337
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Okay.

338
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
That may help us.

339
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Okay.

340
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
And, Mr.

341
00:24:30.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Chairman, I could suggest while she's drafting something to look at sections 92 and 93 because representative turcotte's concern needs to be replicated there also and i think in in those sections the uh the 162 k1 that talks about local option i think that's's what I'd like to see in there would be the second part of that where it talks about a town may adopt this chat, thereby a majority vote of the voters.

342
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
That makes sense.

343
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:21.000
To me, we just don't want to throw this into these communities that already have it and just say, oh, guess what?

344
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.500
I think this is very reasonable, Representative.

345
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.500
Representative Turk, Representative Hamburger?

346
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.500
Well, I was looking down the...

347
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.500
Go ahead, Representative Hamburger.

348
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.500
You're late on.

349
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:43.000
Yeah, the only question I have is that we can't save voters in the cities that have city councils.

350
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.500
So we'll have to allow the city councils to make that.

351
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.500
Elected officials.

352
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.500
Yeah.

353
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.500
But I don't, you know, I think we need to.

354
00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:03.500
This is why I wanted the Municipal Association to look at it.

355
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:14.500
I think the way it normally works is subject to the governing body, which in a city would be the city council.

356
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.500
And in towns, it would be.

357
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.500
The voters.

358
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.500
Yes, down there.

359
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.500
Representative Cardelli.

360
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.500
Thank you.

361
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:45.500
Just one other thing, looking at the language related to Section 83, the one area where I would have a concern is the last part of the last sentence which indicates regardless of a local land use ordinance or regulation.

362
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:54.500
So it looks to me like with that phrase, we are overruling local control of their own ordinances.

363
00:26:54.500 --> 00:27:19.500
That would be my concern in terms of drafting any new language related to section 83 we could just take that out mr chair yes i i actually think he's correct so my suggestion would be since this was very important to new hampshire housing finance authority and housing advocates.

364
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:27.500
Let's see what the attorney for the municipal association comes back with, and hopefully it's workable.

365
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.500
Okay?

366
00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:36.000
You might consider a period right after on line six, after development, period.

367
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
And I think you're probably correct with that.

368
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Okay.

369
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Okay, so now we've, hopefully we've addressed several of those concerns with this bill, this portion of it.

370
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Are there any other areas within Representative Turcotte that we should be looking at?

371
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
On the amendment?

372
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.500
On the amendment, that's right.

373
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:27.000
No, last week in the amendment, or last meeting, committee conference meeting, I went through and went through all the different issues where we believed it should stay in or come out, and I didn't have any other input as to things that the Senate did not disagree on.

374
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.500
Okay, I was just handed the amendment.

375
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.500
Right.

376
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.000
Would you please walk us through that?

377
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:50.000
I would say at this point, because of 92 and 93, there's going to be a further amendment, so it would probably almost be not worth our time.

378
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.500
It's not worth our time right now.

379
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:57.000
You made some changes to 85, correct?

380
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Unfortunately, the numbers aren't going to line up like they used to.

381
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Yeah, it's the numbers.

382
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
It dropped to 83.

383
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
I got you.

384
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:18.500
The body of the bill is what we just, we as the House talked about on, was it Friday?

385
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:27.500
But again, that's going to change now if we come up with new language on those three sections.

386
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:33.000
So we have just been talking about the SB 400 section.

387
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.500
Are there any other portions of this which we want to look at?

388
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:49.000
We know we're going to have to come back to see the modified language here that we just discussed.

389
00:29:49.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Are there any other portions of the entire bill that we want to discuss at this time or need to hammer on?

390
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
I think you need to talk about 430.

391
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
That's the recommendation.

392
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Okay.

393
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
430 then.

394
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:52.500
Are there any any you know you heard the the discussion presented at the very beginning by the house uh does the senate have any reaction to that so i think we indicated last week and obviously we want to see an amendment that we were okay with all of the changes agreed to by the house health and human services committee and house finance we were not okay with the adding of 1044 but i think based on what um representative turcott Let's see.

395
00:30:52.500 --> 00:31:05.000
finance, we were not okay with the adding of 1044, but I think based on what Representative Turcotte said, that's not part of the discussion.

396
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.500
So we're happy about that.

397
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.000
So I believe- Let me clarify, Senator.

398
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:18.500
The House position is what the House came out on 430, including 1044, not excluding.

399
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:28.000
That's why we, in my opening, I stated that 430, as we see it, is not in play anymore.

400
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
The Senate was given the opportunity.

401
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:41.500
The Senate gave us a non-concur on it and then took the amendment off and put, uh, 430 back onto this.

402
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:45.500
So 430 is not, not on the table.

403
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.000
I'm not sure I'm following.

404
00:31:48.000 --> 00:32:03.500
in our last house session the hb4 the SB 430 that came out of the House was our version and a floor amendment that Representative Edwards added was floor amendment 1044S.

405
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:24.000
That is the current House position position i don't know if i can say it another way so and i'll also add senator before um we were told by the uh clerk that we cannot use that position in this bill.

406
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:37.500
So unfortunately, because the Senate did a non-concur when it was a standalone, we cannot talk about our last House position and that was what included 1044.

407
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.500
All right.

408
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:50.500
So I think I understand that we're House Bill 1044 that the Senate non-concurred with is off the table at this point.

409
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:56.500
we cannot discuss it because the clerk said we cannot include it.

410
00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:04.000
However, the last House position was SB 430, and it included the Edwards floor amendment.

411
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:30.500
And since the Senate non-concurred, the current, our position now is 430 is no longer uh sp430 is no longer in play can i get a clarification um maybe it's from the house clerk i don't understand why 430 would be out of play if we non-concurred with a non-germain amendment to it?

412
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:35.000
The House position is SB 430 with 1044 attached.

413
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Without 1044 being attached, we are not willing to accede to only the House's previous position of 430.

414
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Thank you.

415
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:53.000
We are not willing to accede to only the House's previous position of 430.

416
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.500
I've got Paul right here.

417
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.500
Paul, you're on speakerphone right now.

418
00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.500
Mr.

419
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:08.000
Chairman, I'm not sure I understand Representative Turcotte's statement of 430 is not in play.

420
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
430 was added in 1661 at the Senate.

421
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.500
So the discussion regarding 430 can certainly take place.

422
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:28.500
The amendment, Representative Edwards' amendment that was added, that was not agreed to by Senate, which was not germane to this particular Bill 1661.

423
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:33.500
But 430 in and of itself can certainly be considered.

424
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:47.500
Paul, what you're saying is, is because the amendment was non-germaine and was killed by the Senate, that it cannot be brought up in the Committee of Conference.

425
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.000
Is that what you're saying?

426
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Yes, I appreciate it.

427
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.500
It's not in your discussion at all.

428
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.000
but the rest discussing that at all.

429
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
We knew that.

430
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Do you want to sit here?

431
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
No, we understand, Paul.

432
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.500
We understand where we're at.

433
00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:17.000
When I said 430 is off the table, it wasn't in that sense that you're talking about.

434
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.500
Are there any other questions of the House Clerk?

435
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.500
Thank you, Paul.

436
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.500
Hold on.

437
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:29.500
Just make sure that he answered Aaron's question.

438
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.500
It did?

439
00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.500
Thank you.

440
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.500
Yes, Senator.

441
00:35:35.500 --> 00:36:04.500
So then based on that conversation, I just want to make sure that the contents of house bill 1044 which were added by you folks as a floor amendment that we non-concurred with when i say it's off the table for discussions you're not trying to bring that back at this point is that my understanding Thank you.

442
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:15.000
concurred with when I say it's off the table for discussions, you're not trying to bring that back at this point.

443
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Is that my understanding?

444
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.500
We cannot bring that back.

445
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:27.500
And therefore, the entire rest of the rest of let me make let me figure this.

446
00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:34.000
I'll show you be a little different on how I tell you this.

447
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Starting on page six of the side-by-side and going to whenever all those items within 430 were to the end of that.

448
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Page 37.

449
00:36:47.000 --> 00:37:01.500
So what we're saying, since the Senate non-concurred on our version with 1044 attached, that pages 6 through, would you say, Karen, 37, are no longer part of our...

450
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.500
It's 35.

451
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.000
Am I saying that right?

452
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
35.

453
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:18.500
So when I say SB 430 is off the table, it means we're not interested in discussing any part of that.

454
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:23.000
I'm not sure that that's what your clerk said.

455
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.500
Maybe I misunderstood him, but I'm not sure that that's what he said.

456
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.500
I think we're looking at maybe semantics here.

457
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:38.500
Forget about the actual pieces of 430, if you will.

458
00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.500
Think about the process.

459
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:44.500
The process was we had 430 and 1044.

460
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:50.000
We could have gone to a committee of conference on that.

461
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
The Senate decided they did not want to and non-concurred.

462
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Now 430 has been brought back into here.

463
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
On the side-by-side, they have our last position, less 1044.

464
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:17.000
What we are saying is all those positions that are in there, because 1044 that the Senate non-concurred, we are no longer willing to entertain those.

465
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.500
I don't know how many more ways I can say it.

466
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:27.500
I don't know if I'm, am I not being clear?

467
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:32.500
Is the word willing the word to use or able?

468
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.500
Willing.

469
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.500
Willing?

470
00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.500
Allowed?

471
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.500
Correct.

472
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.000
According to Paul Smith, we are able.

473
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.500
But the question is, are we willing?

474
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.500
Yeah.

475
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.500
And the answer on that, no.

476
00:38:52.500 --> 00:39:12.500
well I think if we're going to discuss 1044 we should discuss 1044 because um my understanding of 1044 is that the structure of it definitely undermines critical access hospitals that some of us at this committee of conference represent.

477
00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:15.500
I have two in my district.

478
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.500
I think Senator Hennessy has four.

479
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.500
I think Representative Cordelli has one.

480
00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.500
Representative Umberger has one.

481
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:54.500
And I'm not sure about you, Representative, but we heard extensive testimony in the senate hhs committee that it was more than problematic for um the critical access hospitals and the critical access hospitals are a vital healthcare delivery system for much of the rural areas of the state, the western areas of the state and the northern areas of the state.

482
00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:58.000
So that's why the Senate rejected that.

483
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.500
And I'm not signing a committee of conference report that 1044 comes back.

484
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.500
Sorry, Terry.

485
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.500
Representative Berger.

486
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.500
Thank you.

487
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:19.000
Senator Bradley, I think that what Paul was saying is that we could not bring 1044 back.

488
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
We could not.

489
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:28.500
Right, but then the rest of 430, what Representative Turcotte is saying, is also out.

490
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.000
And I didn't hear him say that.

491
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.500
Yes, that's what he said.

492
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.500
That's correct.

493
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:45.500
All the items contained in 430 can be brought back in six to eight months if they're there.

494
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:58.000
There's still a lot of items in there that many had problems with to begin with, but those can be 430 can be brought back.

495
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.500
So we're hung up on where we are here.

496
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:16.500
I would say the first thing is we get the language on SB 400 and see if we can come to some kind of an agreement on that.

497
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:20.500
I don't actually see that as a problem.

498
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.500
Go from there.

499
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:27.000
I think you guys should talk to him offline.

500
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Paul?

501
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.500
No, you're on with me.

502
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:41.000
I think perhaps we're going to have to take a little time and talk with you on the side.

503
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.500
I understand the rest of the bill is fine.

504
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:49.000
We can talk about, you know, 430.

505
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
I understand that.

506
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
We're not talking.

507
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.500
What about that amendment, though?

508
00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.500
That's no, right?

509
00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.500
Yes.

510
00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.500
That's the rest of the bill.

511
00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.500
Go ahead.

512
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.500
Thank you.

513
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:12.500
Clerk's gonna come over here and be here in about a minute.

514
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.500
Okay.

515
00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.000
We have a two-minute break.

516
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.500
It's cooler in that building.

517
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.500
We're going to take a break.

518
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:26.000
I know it's really hot out there.

519
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.500
And we'll come back as soon as Paul Smith gets here.

520
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.500
Thank you.

521
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.500
Thank you.

522
00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.500
Thank you.

523
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.500
Thank you.

524
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.500
Thank you.

525
00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.500
Thank you.

526
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.500
Thank you.

527
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.500
Thank you.

528
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.500
Thank you.

529
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.500
Thank you.

530
00:42:51.500 --> 00:43:04.000
Those that are in attendance right now, what I'm going to do is we're going to ask that we hear from Paul for a second.

531
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.500
Just ask Paul one question, and then after that, we're going to adjourn.

532
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.500
No, you're not.

533
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.500
You're going to recess.

534
00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:19.500
Recess for a date, a time to be determined determined.

535
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:41.000
My question is that it's my understanding, and you could just say yes or no, that the decision to address 430 is our decision here, that we can address 430, but we cannot address the amendment that we're talking about, the Edwards Amendment.

536
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Is that correct?

537
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Yes, Mr.

538
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Chairman.

539
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Thank you.

540
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:56.000
So with that, we're going to recess this to a time to be determined.

541
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
It's going to be at least 24 hours from now.

542
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
12.

543
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
12, excuse me, 12.

Well, I ain't not coming back 12 hours from now.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.500
