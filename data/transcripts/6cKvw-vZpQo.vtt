yes good morning it apparently we have
 
00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
a bunch of tuesdays that are available
 
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
in may where we don't have committee but
 
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
we have opportunities to do
 
00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
field trips to various places so i would
 
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
like to get
 
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh maybe not the second but
 
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
i would like to get your opinion and um
 
00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.790 align:start position:0%
uh uh
uh

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
suggestions on where we might go
 
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh if we want to do all four tuesdays or
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
if we can't do that maybe we can do two
 
00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 align:start position:0%
of them
 
00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.149 align:start position:0%
of them
but

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
if we have any suggestions i'm willing
 
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
to take them and we can start planning
 
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
and see and just see which ones uh
 
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
the speaker will approve us to go
 
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
so that's that's one
 
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
one thing uh secondly um
 
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
we're coming out of a long drought
 
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
camaraderie here where we used to at the
 
00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
end of the
 
00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
term have a committee luncheon
 
00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 align:start position:0%
uh taking our office assistant with us
 
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
and our our researchers
 
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
and so i'm open to suggestions on
 
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
whether you would like to take advantage
 
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
i know we don't have any
 
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
committee schedule where you're going to
 
00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 align:start position:0%
be here anyway but for those that might
 
00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
like to come back here to do a committee
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
luncheon um i would take that suggestion
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
i i think we should
 
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh i i you know i i don't think if
 
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
angelina's is still open we used to go
 
00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
there it was it was a great place to eat
 
00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
but is it open yeah they're real oh they
 
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
reopen great well perhaps we can do that
 
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
again or we can try to try some other
 
00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 align:start position:0%
endeavor but uh i'm i'm welcome to uh
 
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
suggestions on whether you want to or
 
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
not and if so when last week in may
 
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
maybe or someplace just before session
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
i'm open
 
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
so we want to hear your thoughts about
 
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
a committee lunch
 
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.390 align:start position:0%
a committee lunch
but

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
before we get to that
 
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh i'd point out that we
 
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
sent several bills this year to interim
 
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.550 align:start position:0%
sent several bills this year to interim
study

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
and we could form some subcommittees and
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
begin work
 
00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
on the interim study
 
00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.189 align:start position:0%
on the interim study
activity

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
in the month of may and if we
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
did some of that work on the same day as
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
a luncheon was scheduled then that would
 
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
get every give everyone um just cause to
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
drive here to to participate so and get
 
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.189 align:start position:0%
drive here to to participate so and get
paid

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
and get paid that's correct
 
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
so uh factor that into your discussions
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
about uh whether we should get together
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
for lunch or not so
 
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
let's hear your thoughts and your ideas
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
interested in visiting
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%

that's like sure another uh subject um i
 
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
think the idea of a lunch is absolutely
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
splendid i like the idea of a working
 
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.710 align:start position:0%
splendid i like the idea of a working
session

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to put a bug out there for
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
the idea of taking another look at the
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
5g bill that i think is was going to be
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting between now and
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%

might have been good but we'll look at
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
as may but i i plan to have at least one
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe uh one or two in the in the
 
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.830 align:start position:0%
and maybe uh one or two in the in the
fall

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
refrain from discussing it amongst
 
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
yourselves and just discuss it with
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
everybody here
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
so we're signing up for things
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
so i i don't have a strong sense here
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
yet whether we're gonna try to get
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
together for lunch so let's have a show
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
of hands
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
from existing committee members who
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
would like to get a get together for an
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
all right that's great that looks pretty
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh like a pretty positive response
 
00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
so if we could combine
 
00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:24.309 align:start position:0%
so if we could combine
a

00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
end of session lunch with a stub
 
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on an interim
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
study bill
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
in the same day
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
the ideal situation
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
does any tuesday in may work
 
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.909 align:start position:0%
does any tuesday in may work
for

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.190 align:start position:0%
for
folks

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
there's may 3rd may 10th may 17th and
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
may 24th
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
does anyone have
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
a preference
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
about what day we might choose to engage
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
in some of this activity representative
 
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.710 align:start position:0%
in some of this activity representative
oxenam

00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
oxenam
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i've got a series of
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
medical appointments on tuesdays because
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
i figured those were days that would be
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
available so i know nick the coming
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
tuesday is a bad one for me so if it
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
could not be that tuesday uh okay we can
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
rule out may 3rd so that leaves the 10th
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
the 17th and the 24th
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
anybody feel strongly one way or the
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
other about any of those dates 17th is
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
not good for myself
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
17th is bad
 
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay so now we're down to the 10th
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
the 10th is not good either
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
24th looks best
 
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.630 align:start position:0%
24th looks best
24th

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
24th
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
could we all set aside
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
may 24th as as the
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
date of our end of session lunch
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we can put together a
 
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.350 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we can put together a
subcommittee

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
to study
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
one of the interim study bills on that
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
day as well
 
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
so since we're on that subject
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
let's talk about interim study bills
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i can reach
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
if we're going to
 
00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:04.790 align:start position:0%
if we're going to
uh

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
have a luncheon i i think one
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
i know the first time i ever went to a
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee lunch
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
i was surprised that it was on you so i
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
think that needs to be that
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's on us when we go to lunch
 
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.790 align:start position:0%
it's on us when we go to lunch
um

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.630 align:start position:0%
um
normally

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
normally
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
we pay for it that's
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
the uh other one is that if you're going
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
to have work sessions
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
why not open it to the whole committee
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be doing it that day
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
so i would think that
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
there are a number of topics that were
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
of interest to most of the committee
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
and that anyone usually when you open a
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
work session you have anyone who wants
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
to come can come
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
we should all be
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
i think invited and interested and on
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
the subcommittees i know 5g was very
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
interesting to me
 
00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.949 align:start position:0%
interesting to me
um

00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
and there are several others so i i
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
think that might be the wisest thing to
 
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.509 align:start position:0%
think that might be the wisest thing to
do

00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
excellent points uh
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
so on your first point
 
00:11:10.079 --> 00:11:10.949 align:start position:0%
so on your first point
any

00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
committee lunch would be
 
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.949 align:start position:0%
committee lunch would be
a

00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
dutch treat you pay for yourself
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
add up the bill and then split it
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
yes yes we do pay for the committee
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
researcher and the committee uh
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
admin yes an important point you're
 
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.310 align:start position:0%
admin yes an important point you're
right

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's a good point thanks
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
for bringing that up representative
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
kelly pitts as to your other point
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
i think interim study studies need to be
 
00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
done by the full committee not by a
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so i may have
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
misspoken earlier when i said
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
subcommittee i meant the full committee
 
00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:56.550 align:start position:0%
subcommittee i meant the full committee
would

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
undertake those interim studies
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair um again and i
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
believe that the 5g was not actually
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
meant to be an interim study
 
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
but i um work group
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
was that the intent of that well we we
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
voted to go to interim study oh it was
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thanks this one
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
expressed me the representative mcgee
 
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.350 align:start position:0%
expressed me the representative mcgee
three

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
bills on interim study that for our
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
consideration if we
 
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.870 align:start position:0%
consideration if we
uh

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
hb 1248
 
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
relative to replacement power for net
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
metering customer generators
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
and then uh 1635
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
relative to the purchase of output of
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
limited electric energy produces and
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
including qualifying storage
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
and the last one was the 5g bill
 
00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:54.550 align:start position:0%
and the last one was the 5g bill
1644.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
representative samsic thank you
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't be able to attend on the
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
24th of may because i'm going to be in
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
germany at the time
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
so but that would not preclude if that's
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
the best day for everybody that's fine
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:14.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
as representative plett said
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
any further discussion i i do think that
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
we should interim study 1248 and 1635 as
 
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.470 align:start position:0%
we should interim study 1248 and 1635 as
well

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
um and the 5g bill is probably going to
 
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.110 align:start position:0%
um and the 5g bill is probably going to
take

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
a long time several hours if not
 
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.829 align:start position:0%
a long time several hours if not
longer

00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
longer
 
00:13:35.839 --> 00:13:38.710 align:start position:0%
longer
so

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
is there any feeling amongst committee
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
members about which bill you would like
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
to do on the 24th the day we've picked
 
00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:45.829 align:start position:0%
to do on the 24th the day we've picked
for

00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
no strong feelings okay i'll talk to
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative thomas and we'll pick one
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
and we'll let you guys know
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
all right so is there any further dis
 
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
please forgive me i i seem to have taken
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
next tuesday off the table very quickly
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
for my own personal preference i didn't
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
realize that our noble leader would not
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
be available on at the end of the month
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
i can possibly i think i can move my
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
appointment on that day so
 
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.870 align:start position:0%
appointment on that day so
is

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
is the coming tuesday available to
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
people so that we could include uh
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
representative samsic in our discussions
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay let's have a show of hands how many
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%

the two following days i'm hearing
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%

00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
do have a session that week on the fifth
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be three days
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
in a row forgive me for bringing it up
 
00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:21.509 align:start position:0%
in a row forgive me for bringing it up
sorry

00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:22.790 align:start position:0%
sorry
yeah

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.509 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
with apologies to
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
samsich uh who obviously made travel
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
plans some time ago
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh it looks like we may have to do the
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
24th instead
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
i can't feel sorry if he's in germany
 
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:35.829 align:start position:0%
i can't feel sorry if he's in germany
though

00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:37.350 align:start position:0%
though
but

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
we wish you safe travels to uh to
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
germany and
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
we'll look forward to
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
hearing about your trip when you get
 
00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:45.509 align:start position:0%
hearing about your trip when you get
back

00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
all right i think that takes care of of
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
our discussion of where we're going
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
after this meeting is over today
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
and so i think we can move on to the
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
business of the day so i'd like to
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
resume the executive session on senate
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
and i would like to
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
move the adoption
 
00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
of amendment number 2022
 
00:16:14.199 --> 00:16:15.749 align:start position:0%
of amendment number 2022
1788

00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
1788
 
00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:16.629 align:start position:0%
1788
h

00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
h
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
to senate bill 271 and i recognize
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative thomas second
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
so it's been moved and seconded that we
 
00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:27.990 align:start position:0%
so it's been moved and seconded that we
adopt

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.389 align:start position:0%
adopt
amendment

00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:30.949 align:start position:0%
amendment
1788

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
1788
 
00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:32.710 align:start position:0%
1788
h

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
h
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure there'll be lots of
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
discussion and i'm going to start the
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
discussion first by explaining what this
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly simple amendment it's a
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
substantial change from the original
 
00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:48.949 align:start position:0%
substantial change from the original
bill

00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
as you will recall the original bill
 
00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:53.590 align:start position:0%
as you will recall the original bill
proposed

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
for giving a 58 million dollar what will
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
be a 58 million dollar debt
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
incurred by
 
00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:02.310 align:start position:0%
incurred by
uh

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
burgess biopower
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
a ratepayer debt essentially
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
the original bill forgave that debt
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
and allowed the plant to continue
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
operation under its current model
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
is instead it extends
 
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.029 align:start position:0%
is instead it extends
the

00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
cap that was
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
placed on over market payments
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
by the 2018 senate bill 577
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
it further requires burgess biopower to
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
open its books
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
to the department of energy for an
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
investigation into its
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.830 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
amendment does not solve the problem
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
that burgess bio power
 
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.270 align:start position:0%
that burgess bio power
faces

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
faces
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
but there did not seem to be on the
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
immediate horizon
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
a solid solution to that problem
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
therefore it seems prudent to me
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
to spend more time investigating
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
whether there can be
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
a satisfactory
 
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.590 align:start position:0%
a satisfactory
solution

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
to this problem
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
this bill will give us that time
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
another year
 
00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:38.789 align:start position:0%
another year
and

00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
i know there's a lot of discussion
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's been going on amongst various
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
stakeholder parties
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
about what a future permanent solution
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
i'm confident
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
that such a solution
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
will emerge
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
in the next year
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
therefore i think it's prudent
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
to pass this amendment
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
provide the additional time that's
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
needed to study this question
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
come up with a solution and then resolve
 
00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.990 align:start position:0%
come up with a solution and then resolve
it

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
permanently to the
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
to the best ability
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
the to the
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
well the the solution we come up with be
 
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.270 align:start position:0%
well the the solution we come up with be
perfect

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
probably not
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
will it be politically
 
00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:30.070 align:start position:0%
will it be politically
uh

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.590 align:start position:0%
uh
controversial

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.549 align:start position:0%
controversial
probably

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
but it's it's
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
just because something is hard to do
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you should avoid trying to
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
i fully expect
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
that a permanent solution to this
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
problem will be hard to do
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
but we have to try
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
doing what this amendment does kicking
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
the can down the road but the reason
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment kicks the can down the
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
road is because we need the time
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
to come up with that permanent solution
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm proposing this
 
00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:09.750 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm proposing this
amendment

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
and now i'm anxious to hear your
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
thoughts about it representative
 
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.190 align:start position:0%
thoughts about it representative

[Music]

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
i know we're talking about the amendment
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to mention a couple of
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
things about the original bill because i
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
think we deserve to to bring that up i
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
don't think i've ever seen a bill that
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
was this open-ended where it turns
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
around and says the public utilities
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
commission shall amend any of its orders
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
as necessary to protect the continued
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
operation of the burgess bio plant i
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
don't think new hampshire's ever had a
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
bill like that we sold some private
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
company no matter what you do no matter
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
how badly managed you are no matter how
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
much you waste or don't waste money
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep feeding revenues to
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
you so you can't close that's an
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
open-ended never-ending promise of
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
unlimited funding when i asked the main
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor he said whatever whatever it
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
takes whatever it cost that's just bad
 
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.430 align:start position:0%
takes whatever it cost that's just bad
legislation

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
besides that fact i don't think the bill
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
is uh correct in that it tells the puc
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
what they have to do my understanding is
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
that a utility can bring a purchase
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
power agreement to the puc
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
and the puc can rev review that and they
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
can either approve it disapprove it or
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
say we'll only approve if you make the
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
following change but they don't have the
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
authority to make utilities sign a
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
purchase power agreement the puc can't
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
dictate in this case to ever source you
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
will supply unlimited amount of funds to
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
burgess biomass whatever they say they
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
need you'll give them so i don't think
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
that that's even legal
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
and the third thing i want to mention
 
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
here is if you look across the scope of
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
new england almost every power plant
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 or 25 years we've gone
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
from a regulated to a less regulated
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
market has been bought and sold most of
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
them many times up to and including the
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
biggest one in the state which is the
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
two nuclear in new england the nuclear
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
plant seabrook and also the nuclear
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
plant down in millstone i mentioned the
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
londonderry plant down in which was a
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
gas-fired plant which at one point i
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
think the original owners just walked
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
away and said
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
to the bank it's yours
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
and i think it's been sold a couple more
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
times since then but now it's operating
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
and it's running at a profit at least
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's not getting a subsidy from the rate
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
pay as i can tell you that
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
and that they continue to operate so the
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
point i'm trying to make here is just
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
because the present ownership of burgess
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
biomass goes away doesn't mean the plant
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
goes away they can go in this this is
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
one of the things that this year will
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
give them is a year to negotiate with
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
anybody out there and maybe they'll have
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
to sell it for quote pennies on the
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
dollar like was done in the londonderry
 
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
plant but just because this ownership
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
group leaves doesn't mean the plant's
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
going to be shut down and in fact
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
there's probably a price out there
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere if you drop it down enough
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
where the plant is viable i don't know
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
where that is i'm not an expert at how
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
much it costs to run a wood burning
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
plant but i know that we've also been
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
told by the some of the other wood
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
burning plants for the last i don't know
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
10 15 years that they're going to close
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
if they don't get additional subsidies
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
on top of the rps
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
and yet one plant is still open so there
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
must be a way to do it if you can work
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
your numbers right
 
00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.750 align:start position:0%
your numbers right
so

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
i i just think that we we have to look
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
at some options as the chairman said
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
this gives a year but the big thing is
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
it opens up the books we don't know
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is the original bill
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
i i would assume uh
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
whatever is necessary to protect the
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
continued operation would burgess would
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
just send eversource a bill every month
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
and say here's how much extra money i
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
need to keep running this allows the
 
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
department of energy to go through the
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
books and see exactly what their costs
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
are the revenues and come up with an
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
honest assessment of what's going on at
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
that plant which we haven't been able to
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
do up until now does it kick the can
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
down the road a little bit yeah but in
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
the year we're going to pick up the can
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
and read what it says on the label
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
because we're going to know the finances
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
of the burgess biomass plan what it's
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
going to take to make that a viable
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
entity they'll stay going forward
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
without huge ratepayer subsidies and
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
just don't forget about one other thing
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
remember this plant because of the
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
contract with the ppa they got 27
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
million dollars in rps payments for rex
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's more than anybody else gets
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's 27 million dollar bonus for being
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
green and yet they say that's not good
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
enough even with 27 million dollar bonus
 
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
they still can't run so i think we
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
really need to look at the ownership
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
structure there and it's time to start
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
thinking about possibly selling the
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
plant because it just isn't going to
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
work under the way it is right now and i
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
strongly recommend we approve this
 
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.070 align:start position:0%
strongly recommend we approve this
amendment

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
let me preface my remarks by saying i i
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
want the plant to stay open but there
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
are two things
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about one i thought that
 
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.549 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about one i thought that
the

00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
problem was the 58 million
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's already been collected
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
that is see that was the wedge and
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's what we were looking to forgive
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
so this bill or that's what they were
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
looking to get forgiven this bill does
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
not do that as far as i can see and i'll
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
bring up the second problem or the
 
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.630 align:start position:0%
bring up the second problem or the
second

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
question i have
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
is that if the puc is
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
quasi judiciary
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
how can the legislature
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
dictate to them
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
what they shall do and i
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's other wording or
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
other ways about it but i was not quite
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
in sync with that particular paragraph
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
so if those questions could be answered
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kelly pitts
 
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
to your first question you're right this
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
bill does not forgive the 58 million
 
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.390 align:start position:0%
bill does not forgive the 58 million
dollars

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
as the original bill that came over from
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
the senate did
 
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.269 align:start position:0%
the senate did
and

00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
the reason it doesn't do that is because
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
those are
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
rate payer dollars
 
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.950 align:start position:0%
rate payer dollars
and

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem prudent to just give
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
away 58 million of ratepayer dollars
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
the poc is a regulatory
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
agency ultimately as is the department
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
of energy or many of the functions of
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and legislative
 
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.269 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and legislative
activity

00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
is the guide they use
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
to make their regulatory decisions
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
so the legislature can tell
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
the poc and the doe
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
what to do in broad strokes
 
00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.909 align:start position:0%
what to do in broad strokes
and

00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's perfectly legitimate i think
 
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.990 align:start position:0%
it's perfectly legitimate i think
for

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
and this legislature to say we think
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
this is the best course of action going
 
00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:57.190 align:start position:0%
this is the best course of action going
forward

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
representative platt has a comment but
 
00:26:59.120 --> 00:26:59.990 align:start position:0%
representative platt has a comment but
what

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
just uh clarification from
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
representatives i wanted to follow up my
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
my understanding from the hearings
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
that we had was that the 58 million that
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
we were talking about has already been
 
00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:12.950 align:start position:0%
we were talking about has already been
collected

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
collected
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
so it would not be an additional
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
subsidy am i correct in that assumption
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
i believe that is correct yes
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
representative platt yes i endorse all
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
of the comments made by my colleague
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
representative harrington with one minor
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
exception when he said next year maybe
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
we can come out with
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't have huge
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
ratepayer subsidies i would amend that
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
to say without any ratepayer subsidies
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the scope the proper
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
scope of this problem is much bigger
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
than the burgess
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
plant that it encompa it's really about
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
the economy
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
of that area up there and um
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
it's almost like um
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh we're being held hostage by the fact
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
that we can't just throw away all kinds
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
of jobs
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
i think as a parallel effort it might be
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
useful to
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
set up a commission to study
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
that economy and not come up with
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
possible ideas either to just turn it
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
back into wilderness or
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
find another um
 
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
way for that part of the world to uh by
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
part of our state to
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
be economically viable there was a
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
plan once about
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
and i don't know much about it but i
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
know there was a talk about a plan
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
to have a large
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
greenhouse producing fresh vegetables
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
be around up there and it would be a
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
economic uh support i would think
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
so i think um
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
a big in addition to what we're doing
 
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
here i think we should be recommending a
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
much larger scope
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
investigation thank you
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
i would agree with you that
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
a permanent solution is not just a
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
solution for this one particular bio
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
mass plant
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
but is actually a solution for the
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
forest products industry that's
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
the most important
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
and statewide
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
interest that we can serve here is to
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
take care of the forest products
 
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.310 align:start position:0%
take care of the forest products
industry

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
further comment representative mcgee
 
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh i just had a couple of comments on
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
comments that have already been said um
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
i noticed that we're discussing how the
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
department of energy is now
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
also a regulatory body in addition to
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission and i
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
did think that in our discussion of hb2
 
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
and the um you know when the department
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
of energy came into being
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
we had several discussions about the
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
bright red line between regulatory and
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
executive or administrative functions of
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
that agency
 
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
and my concern was that the lines be
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
blurred and it seems that that's what's
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
happening now is that we're saying well
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
if we want some regulatory decisions we
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
can just put it
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
into this agency of the executive branch
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
so i have a concern about that but the
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
other thing i wanted to mention is that
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
it it discard it's discouraging to me
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
that when we talk about
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
these very you know sophisticated power
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
purchase agreements that were put
 
00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:47.590 align:start position:0%
purchase agreements that were put
through

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
um an in-depth process where the
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
stakeholders had agreement that we as a
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee because we weren't personally
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
at the table or we don't understand the
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
details are saying we need to know more
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
i actually don't think
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
that the financials of the burgess
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
biomass plant
 
00:31:05.679 --> 00:31:06.470 align:start position:0%
biomass plant
are

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.669 align:start position:0%
are
opaque

00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
opaque
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
i think it's just that we personally
 
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
have not seen those
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
my question would be
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
this bill is vague and what it does is
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't just kick the can down the
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
road it it continues the problem that
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
we've had already
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
um the reason eversource ratepayers are
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
are on the line for this money is
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
because of the power purchase agreement
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
the money was collected because
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
that was agreed what what we were being
 
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
asked to do with sb 271 i believe
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
is to say that the plant itself was not
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
on the line for coming up with all of
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
that money that it was going to be a
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
wash that we were going to allow in
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
order to let them go forward and they
 
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.870 align:start position:0%
order to let them go forward and they
offered

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
offered
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
to put language in the bill that said
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
there would be no further subsidies from
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
the ratepayers so the thing that folks
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
on the panel are saying they desire was
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
offered by the plant we didn't take that
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
solution and now we're saying
 
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
without any details or directives about
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
what would be suitable in terms of what
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to find in the books
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
we don't have any
 
00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:20.470 align:start position:0%
we don't have any
uh

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
we don't have any details about what
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
hurdle the plant is required to meet
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
in order to continue um so i have a lot
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
you know i i'm a co-sponsor on this
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
because i want to see us resolve it
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
but i also
 
00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:38.799 align:start position:0%
have questions about what it is we're
 
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
actually trying to
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
achieve with this amendment because
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
we didn't
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
we didn't give the solution that that we
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
were asked uh to provide
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
and we also haven't given any definition
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
to which solution
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
would be acceptable
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
i guess that's where i would leave it
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
right we're saying
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's something out there we don't we
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
don't know and we are not giving any
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
direction on
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
and when you know we're leaving
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
everything up in the air which i think
 
00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:08.710 align:start position:0%
everything up in the air which i think
is

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
is a weak position for us
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
and for the state
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i would respond to that
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
by pointing out
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
that the language offered by the
 
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.389 align:start position:0%
that the language offered by the
company

00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
there was grave concern amongst several
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
parties who looked at that language
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
about whether it was achievable
 
00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:30.710 align:start position:0%
about whether it was achievable
and

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
this one year extension will do
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
is allow people time to determine
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
whether that in fact is achievable and
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
if it is then maybe it'll go forward
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
at a future date but not today
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just in the way of
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
a little background as to some little
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
bit of history on this in the past we
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
had a thing called qfs which were
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
qualified facilities and this has come
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
out of the federal government some years
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
ago and basically
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
it was it was determined that renewable
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
generators like the small hydros and
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
small wood burning plants could be paid
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
what we expected the market rate to be
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
so while
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
prices for electricity were four and
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
five cents a kilowatt hour they were
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
getting paid 15 and 16 cents a kilowatt
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
hour that all added up to around 2
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in over market rates
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
that were paid to these qualifying
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
facilities so the whole reason for the
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
cap in this one was when it was
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
negotiated for the ppa it was decided
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
wait a minute everyone look into the
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
future it's going to be difficult to
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
determine no one knows what the energy
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
price is going to be
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
a year from now if you figure it out let
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
me know because then we can both be rich
 
00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:45.510 align:start position:0%
me know because then we can both be rich
but

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
so that was put in as a safety valve for
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
the rate payers so if if when things
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
went along and as it turned out after
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
this agreement was signed elect
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
wholesale energy prices actually went
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
down for a number of years now they're
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
trending back up but it was to maximize
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
the amount that the um that the
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
ratepayers would have to pay and once it
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
got to a certain amount that the biomass
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
plant was supposed to start paying them
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
back all terms of which they agreed with
 
00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.630 align:start position:0%
back all terms of which they agreed with
and

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
now they want to change that now you
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned they sat here and said that
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
there's no additional cost but you know
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
what that's not in the bill anywhere
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
what is in the bill is the public
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
utility should amend its orders as
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect the continued
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
operation regardless if you heard
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
senator bradley regardless of what it
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
takes regardless of the cost so the fact
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
that they say we might not be asking
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
more money does not give me a warm
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
feeling this bill would allow them
 
00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.150 align:start position:0%
feeling this bill would allow them
unlimited

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
unlimited
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
funding the way it was proposed and i
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
think what we have here is a compromise
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
that gives us a year to look at it we
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
open up their books we have a better
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
idea of what's going on with really what
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
their costs our expenses are and it also
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
gives them that time to look into the
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
possibility of selling the plant because
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
like i said i don't think there is a
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
maybe there's one or two out there but i
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
think the overwhelming majority of
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
plants uh generating plants in new
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
england have been sold at least once
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
since we started restructuring in the
 
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
late 1990s
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
representative sausage
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:15.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
i want to say that i have a lot of
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
respect for senator bradley
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that as as office holders
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
elected office holders
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
i personally believe that one of the
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
my primary
 
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.550 align:start position:0%
my primary
obligation

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that i don't destroy
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
anybody's jobs in new hampshire that's
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
their livelihood
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
and therefore i'm going to do a lot of
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
things to make sure that that doesn't
 
00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.030 align:start position:0%
things to make sure that that doesn't
happen

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
and yes
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative harrington
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
about a need for oversight that
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
this is not an open-ended checkbook that
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
they can charge whatever they want and
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
have all kinds we can we could do
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
something to restrict that and i also
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
agree with representative owes on the
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
idea that this is not a permanent
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
solution this is just gives us some
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
extra time
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
um however
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
when i look at the amendment to i i
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
noticed that the amendment clearly
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
undervalues the value of this facility
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
previously where the original wording
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
was something like essential
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
or invaluable now it's just valuable and
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
maybe needed and so forth and you know
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is a renewable energy
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
plant the only one of that kind of
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
magnitude in our state and that it
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
provides all kinds of ancillary benefits
 
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.470 align:start position:0%
provides all kinds of ancillary benefits
to

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
health and welfare everybody including
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
the timber industry but also the rest of
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
i think that's a reason in an election
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
year particularly not to do anything
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
destructive in this situation yes we
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
need a permanent solution and and we
 
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
should work on that and i agree also
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
support or whatever we want to call it
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
should not be coming just from
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
ratepayers it could be coming from a
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
more broader base of new hampshire
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
residents that is a good idea we don't
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
have time now to resolve this today
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
so i am not going to be voting for this
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
amendment i i support the original bill
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
as is and i believe that we can do
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
things that we could make sure we can
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
put some kind of guard rails in place
 
00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:21.910 align:start position:0%
put some kind of guard rails in place
for

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
next year to uh if we decide this goes
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
ahead for the time being as is then we
 
00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:29.030 align:start position:0%
ahead for the time being as is then we
should

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to modify if we
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
feel that there is a better solution
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
long-term to it
 
00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.950 align:start position:0%
long-term to it
so

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
like i said i'm not going to vote for
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
but i understand the hard work that was
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
put in and i understand the fact that
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
this one year extension is better than
 
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.109 align:start position:0%
this one year extension is better than
nothing

00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh now i'm a scientist but i have an mba
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
in business as well and i know that if a
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
one-year extension is not very valuable
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
for a business they can't plan for a
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
year they can't plan for the future what
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
they can plan for is how they're going
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
to sell it or get out of the business
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
and close shop within a year so i think
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
this is actually
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
a bill that really is sending a message
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
we don't support this plan
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
right now there's no guarantee we will
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
support it in the future obviously in a
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
net collection year we like to pretend
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
to support things but i have no
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
confidence that this is a good bill with
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment i would much sooner see
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
the original bill go through and maybe
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
we can modify those terms in the future
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
or we can put some kind of guard rails
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
in place so thank you mr chairman
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative merner
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
when we passed 577
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
three and a half years ago
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
the year after we passed this the
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
electric wholesale electric rates went
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
crashing i have small hydros up there
 
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.790 align:start position:0%
crashing i have small hydros up there
that

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
friends of mine and partners own i mean
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
two and a half cents on the open market
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
i know we went through a time
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
obviously that was uncertain so you know
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
this didn't play out the way we wanted
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
it to play out back when we passed the
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
bill which i endorsed back in
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
whatever year it was three and a half
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.230 align:start position:0%
years ago
2018.

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
2018.
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
so you know there's a lot of factors
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
that played into this so i think it's
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
really really important that we look at
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
this for the next year now that the
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
market has totally changed in the last
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
six months everything's totally changed
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
it's been turned on its head
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
i mean we had an average daily price of
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
a 135 dollars a megawatt in the month of
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
january when the year before it was 30
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
dollars so you know things have changed
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
and to the point on the low grade wood
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
thanks to uh
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
my uh vice chair
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
and myself and i think janine is on the
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
bill we have a low-grade wood commission
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
that has just passed it went through
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
reckon resources and it just passed the
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
senate so we're gonna have a low-grade
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
wood commission that we can look at
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking there's a big plant that
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
was proposed up north for a gasification
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
of flow-grade wood that's kind of on the
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
fence right now there's two sites
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
and to the point of mr man we have two
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
10-acre buildings
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
in berlin but it has nothing to do with
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
this power they're going to run on gas
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
they we actually passed the bill in our
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee back in 18
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
to the gas for an exclusion on the gas
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
for those plants for those two big
 
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.470 align:start position:0%
for those plants for those two big
operations

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
if it
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
comes to fruition it's supposed to be
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
going forward right now
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's kind of a hydroponic
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
plants they're two 10 acre buildings
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
they're huge
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
they're just down the road from this
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
plant but it's going to run on natural
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
gas because we have a gas line that runs
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
across coast county and they're going to
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
attack that
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative murder
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you tom thank you chair um first
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
i'd love to hear you talk about the uh
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
how a broad solution for our forestry
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
industry i think until we solve that
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue to have problems
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
i also agree with uh
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
representing some such
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
and that i've seen a two-year uh start
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
um audit would serve us much better than
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
a one year it's hard to make decisions
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
and we're not even talking about a full
 
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.390 align:start position:0%
and we're not even talking about a full
year

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
it's hard to make decisions business
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
decisions in such a limited amount of
 
00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.430 align:start position:0%
decisions in such a limited amount of
time

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
so that's one of my other concerns
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
um and my other concern i'm sure you
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
could address this one is
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
this bill seems like it had a lot of
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
input from a variety of sources the
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
department of energy is certainly
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
weighed in and said they're fully
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
prepared to take on the audit of this
 
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.030 align:start position:0%
prepared to take on the audit of this
company

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
fully okay that's that's that was my
 
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
main concern um i don't know if i'm
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
go along with the amendment i'm
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
certainly going to
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
want to vote positively either for the
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
bill or the amendment and see this so
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thomas uh thank
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
you mr chair i'd like to hop on to what
 
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative murder said
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
my bill uh hb
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
one zero zero five
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
data has established a commission to
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
study the forest industry and
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
wood products to how we can better
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
support the forest industry uh
 
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
on with other things other than just
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
you know ratepayers
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
and i believe that
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
with that knowledge
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
this amendment extending
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
the bill a year
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
will give us time for the commission to
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
come together and give them time to come
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
up with alternative actions that will
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
that will help the forest industry uh
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
that's uh this commission is uh
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
greatly supported by the forest industry
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
of course and the forest service and the
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
and the governor and it's something that
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
we need to look at and so i see this
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
amendment as
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
time spent to allow the plan to operate
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
while this commission does its work and
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
while the doe does its work
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
for the books
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
so with that knowledge and this
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
commission being established which i
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
intend to be on
 
00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.829 align:start position:0%
intend to be on
um

00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
i support this amendment as a kind of a
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
stop debt measure until we
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
this being a baseload plant which is
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
hasn't been mentioned yet is very
 
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
important i'd like a clarification
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
if possible that this bill will not
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
encourage or
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
will not cause any additional charge to
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
the ratepayers that the status quo with
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
this amendment is going to remain in
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
other words the money that's being
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
collected now will continue to be
 
00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.950 align:start position:0%
collected now will continue to be
collected

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
collected
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
is that a correct assumption that this
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
is not going to
 
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.109 align:start position:0%
is not going to
uh

00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
raise the rates
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
in any way at this time
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question is a little
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
none of the three
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
orders apparently that are mentioned in
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment addresses cost recovery
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
i just learned that this morning
 
00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:10.550 align:start position:0%
i just learned that this morning
and

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
so there is the possibility
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
that cost recovery will be have will be
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
something we will have to
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
concern ourselves with in the inevitable
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:25.829 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
that

00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:25.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
this amendment if if we pass it will
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
generate with the senate so
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
while i don't want to ignore that
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
idea i don't think we can fix it here
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
this morning but there is a way to fix
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
it before the bill gets to the
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
governor's desk
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative oxenam
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
um in in your earlier remarks you spoke
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
about a study that would look at the
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
forest products industry more broadly as
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
being something that was in your
 
00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.270 align:start position:0%
being something that was in your
amendment

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
we've now heard about a bill that's
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
passed elsewhere which
 
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
apparently will provide such a study
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
what we have in this amendment is an
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
audit by the doe looking at the books of
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
this particular plant
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
that's a it's a very big disconnect
 
00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.670 align:start position:0%
that's a it's a very big disconnect
between

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
when you
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
um gave us an overview of the amendment
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
you talked about this not being about
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
just one bill but being about the forest
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
products industry more broadly
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh so having having now heard about this
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
other bill it seems to me it would be
 
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.950 align:start position:0%
other bill it seems to me it would be
useful

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
useful
 
00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:39.750 align:start position:0%
useful
for

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
your intention in bringing this
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
amendment to still be included here that
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
that this um
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
audit and report by the department of
 
00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.829 align:start position:0%
audit and report by the department of
energy

00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
which is going to be very narrowly
 
00:46:51.599 --> 00:46:52.710 align:start position:0%
which is going to be very narrowly
focused

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
focused
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
is not the intention of this body the
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
intention is to support a much broader
 
00:46:57.839 --> 00:46:59.750 align:start position:0%
intention is to support a much broader
study

00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
i think you might have misinterpreted my
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
earlier comments slightly
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
what i was talking about when i
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
introduced or did the overview for this
 
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.109 align:start position:0%
introduced or did the overview for this
amendment

00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
was the fact that the
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
additional year
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
that this bill provides or this
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
amendment provides
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
not only for a department of energy
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
investigation and audit
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
but would also allow for
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
discussions that i know are happening
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
because i've participated in them
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
about possible long-term solutions to
 
00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:35.510 align:start position:0%
about possible long-term solutions to
this

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
issue to this problem
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
i didn't say that this amendment
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
provided for such a study
 
00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.190 align:start position:0%
provided for such a study
and

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
i think you misinterpreted my comments
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
to to say that follow-up
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
i i did try to take down your remarks
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
because i understood them to be
 
00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:52.390 align:start position:0%
because i understood them to be
important

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
and you said that you were looking for
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
a permanent solution in as the ultimate
 
00:47:59.040 --> 00:47:59.910 align:start position:0%
a permanent solution in as the ultimate
goal

00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
goal
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
and that was not just for this one plant
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
but actually a solution for the forest
 
00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
products industry
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm just i'm just asking if
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
there's a way and maybe it's at the
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
committee of conference to incorporate
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
that notion that like the way you
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
handled the um sec with a we had a bill
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
that was a short-term solution temporary
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
and we had one that looked to the future
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
so that there would be a a a much better
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
and hopefully permanent solution forward
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that suggestion
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh representative samsic
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman one last question
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
i i had conversations with some of the
 
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.030 align:start position:0%
i i had conversations with some of the
stakeholders

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
and i was told that this plan is already
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
providing almost all the financial
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
information that is requested in this
 
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.790 align:start position:0%
information that is requested in this
amendment

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
is that correct and what's missing and
 
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.349 align:start position:0%
is that correct and what's missing and
um

00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't seem like
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
there's that much missing at this point
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
much of the language of this amendment
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
came from the department of energy
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
this is something that the department of
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
energy feels is necessary to gather
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
information sufficient
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
to make future long-term decisions about
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
how to proceed
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
in solving this problem
 
00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.549 align:start position:0%
in solving this problem
follow-up

00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any other facility that
 
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
the department of energy is going to
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
look into their books and see how
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
they're being operated
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any now
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
further comments representative liewicki
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman it would seem that
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
getting the audit done would give us
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
some information which we may or may not
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
already have because the plant's going
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
to be paying so much a ton for wood
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
chips they're going to have so much
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
operating cost personnel and so forth
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
and that's going to give us a number
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
that should say this is what we can
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
afford to run on per kilowatt hour per
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour it just
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
it seems like fairly simple arithmetic
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
if we've got the
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
chairman i think that goes back to my
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
original concern
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
around what is it we're trying to get at
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
because we can get the math
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
right we can have that which we may not
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
have now which is a is a good thing
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
but the whole first paragraph here that
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
we've taken
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
the adjectives and and watered them down
 
00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
a bit to make the plant not quite as
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
essential in terms of the language
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
the question still becomes regardless of
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
what that math ends up being how much
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
value is given to the other pieces of
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
what the plant provides to the new
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire economy are we taking into
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
consideration if we have no metrics and
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
we have no criteria for how that's being
 
00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.230 align:start position:0%
we have no criteria for how that's being
weighed

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
weighed
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
then how do we know
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
how do we know what we're marching
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
towards in terms of having an audit
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
because an audit is simply
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
you know the pluses and the minuses but
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
not the value
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
i know it's a complicated question but
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's really what is before us
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative platt
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
there were
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
more than one plant in new hampshire and
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
each one of them could argue about value
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
i don't see any such argument leading to
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
i think also the answer to your question
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
would be we have a renewable portfolio
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
standard and that standard seeks to
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
answer the question how do we value
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
these these resources
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
00:51:41.839 --> 00:51:43.109 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
sausage

00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
sausage
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
well i couldn't resist uh thank you mr
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
chairman couldn't resist uh responding
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
to represent platt
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
it is true that these other plants are
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
not getting a subsidy in fact they
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
having to be surcharged for the harm
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
they do to our environment and the
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
dependency we have to them from outside
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
fuel sources no they shouldn't be given
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
the subsidy
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative oxendine did you have
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
another comment
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you very much um i i wanted
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
to call everyone's attention to the map
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
that was presented to us at the public
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
hearing that showed that the
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
the issue here is not simply this plant
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
but it's the sourcing of wood products
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
from across the state that the issue of
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
the value of this plant what it pays in
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
taxes to the city of berlin what it
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
provides in terms of jobs what it
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
provides in terms of people who sell
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
timbering equipment and
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
pick up trucks to people who actually
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
perform these jobs the value of this
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
goes way
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
way beyond
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh the issue of of the single plant and
 
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm very very pleased that we
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
are going to have the commission that
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
came out of representative thomas's bill
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
that that's that's a great thing to have
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
out there but it's not solving this
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
problem and and one year doesn't even
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
successfully kick this down the road uh
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
it'll be
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
there was a timeline in one of the
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
attachments that came out yesterday that
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
said by the time the puc looks at this
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
and gets back
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
it the year will be practically used up
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
and it's not like the doe isn't doing a
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
lot of other things at the same time so
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
i i i feel like if we were to suspend
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
this session
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
and have an opportunity perhaps a small
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
group could work up an alternative
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that could take us uh forward
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
to some consensus but the the amendment
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
that we have before us is is not one
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
that uh that speaks to the the really
 
00:53:45.839 --> 00:53:46.549 align:start position:0%
that uh that speaks to the the really
it

00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
important dare i say vital
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
role that's played by this industry
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
which it it it has ramifications across
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
the economy and i i know uh questions
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
were raised at the public hearing which
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
talked about tourism
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
cross-country skiing hiking
 
00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:05.750 align:start position:0%
cross-country skiing hiking
did

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
this has
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
it did the ripples the ripples go
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
throughout the economy and i think we
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
giving this issue the the significant
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
attention it deserves and not rushing
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
ahead with a with an amendment that you
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
know purported to be a study but but
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's just an audit and
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
i i can't i can't see supporting it as
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
it is thank you
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
thank you you are absolutely right
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
all the things you talked about are why
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
this issue is so complicated
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
and why it's so hard to come up with a
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
permanent solution
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to come up with that
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
solution today
 
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
or even in this session year of this
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislature i don't believe
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
and that's why i believe we need another
 
00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:52.710 align:start position:0%
and that's why i believe we need another
year

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
to really
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
put our
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
noses to the grindstone
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
to come up with a
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
workable solution
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
and i think we've been going about it
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
the wrong way
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
subsidizing biomass plants is not the
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
best way to to support the forest
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
products industry
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
maybe what we should be focusing our
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
attention on is the forest products
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
industry and
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
just to throw out a couple of ideas and
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that these are
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
a solution but to throw out a couple of
 
00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:29.510 align:start position:0%
a solution but to throw out a couple of
ideas

00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
the state could buy low-grade timber and
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
then sell it back to the
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
biomass plants
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
at a steep discount
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
could potentially do that it would
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
require taxpayer money but it could
 
00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.390 align:start position:0%
require taxpayer money but it could
happen

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
there are ways to solve this problem but
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
we need time to come up with a permanent
 
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.069 align:start position:0%
we need time to come up with a permanent
solution

00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
and i think we have to go forward today
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
by amending this bill so that we'll have
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
time to do that
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative callie
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
just a pitts a quick question uh i i'm
 
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
going to support the amendment but who's
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
going to be working on this is is
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
partially st e going to be working on it
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
department of rev who's going to be
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
working on these solutions because they
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
really have to be worked on
 
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
and so i just would like
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
you perhaps to give some thought
 
00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.470 align:start position:0%
you perhaps to give some thought
where

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
this committee would fit in
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
since we are so concerned with these
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
i think the overall guidance will come
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
from the commission that's established
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
by the bill that representative thomas
 
00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.150 align:start position:0%
by the bill that representative thomas
submitted

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
that commission
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
will give a lot of
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
guidance to the effort
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
to how we
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
solve the problem of how we support the
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
forest products industry
 
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.829 align:start position:0%
forest products industry
and

00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
by so supporting that industry we can
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
probably find ways to help other
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
industries in the process
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative partial yes thank you
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
chair looking over the study committee
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
it looks like a fantastic committee i
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
noticed a sunset date on that as a
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
december of
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
2023 in order to have your work
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
completed which is a year after this
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
audit which may or may not make sense i
 
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
can understand that
 
00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.470 align:start position:0%
can understand that
um

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.069 align:start position:0%
um
my

00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:23.270 align:start position:0%
my
question

00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
is you foresee a situation does the uh
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
drafters of this amendment foresee a
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
situation where we'll be coming back
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
next year to authorize yet another stop
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
gap method of
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
bill in order to carry us over to 2023
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
when looking to get some final solutions
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
um i i really can't speculate on what
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
could happen a year from now i i see
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
addressing the burgers power plant issue
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
directly in the forest industry
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
indirectly and i see that my bill uh on
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
the commission addresses the overall
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
state forest issue and products in a way
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
that we may either get away from
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
power plants for the for the forest
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
industry or to
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
use them in conjunction with the health
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
of the forest and other forest products
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
that that could be developed
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
so i really don't know what could happen
 
00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
a year from now
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
i i will look at it
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
very critically
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to extend it past next
 
00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.390 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to extend it past next
year

00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
unless we come up with some permanent
 
00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:48.309 align:start position:0%
unless we come up with some permanent
solution

00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh i will say
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
that i personally
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
should i be fortunate enough to get
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
reelected to this legislature
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
will undertake a major effort to come up
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
with a permanent solution to this
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
problem with legislation
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is a personal commitment that i
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
will make
 
00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:10.309 align:start position:0%
will make
today

00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
to all of you and to the public
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
that i will work diligently in
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
forest products can commission and in
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
conjunction with any stakeholder
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
who has an interest in this subject
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
we will find a solution
 
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
it may not be a perfect solution and as
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
i said earlier it may not be easy to get
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
something passed
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
because they will there will be people
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
who will object to
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
anything you come up with right
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
and that's how you refine ideas and how
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
you improve ideas
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
that effort will happen because i'm
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
pledging you to to to you all today that
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
i will work to make it happen
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative samsic
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
in light of
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
your commitment here today and also in
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
light of the discussion we just had
 
01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.710 align:start position:0%
light of the discussion we just had
about

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
various options um
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
picking up the suggestion that
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative partial meant made before
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
how would you feel about this amendment
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
being amended to go from one year to two
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
years which would seem like a more
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable time to get stuff like this
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
my reaction to that is that two years is
 
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
too long
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
if we're going to get this done we need
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
a deadline
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
i was in business for 40 years and i
 
01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.390 align:start position:0%
i was in business for 40 years and i
watched

01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
watched
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
projects that never got done because
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
they didn't have a deadline
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
you got to have a deadline to make
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
something happen
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
establishes a really
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
aggressive deadline and that'll ensure
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
that we get something
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
done representative mcgee thank you mr
 
01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:58.870 align:start position:0%
done representative mcgee thank you mr
chairman

01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.750 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
back to the deadline i'm project manager
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
here agree with you about the deadlines
 
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.109 align:start position:0%
here agree with you about the deadlines
um

01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
i but is it the right deadline i think i
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
heard representative thomas say that he
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
would not be interested in an extension
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
if we get to the end of one year which
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
would be may of next year
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
and we don't have a final solution to to
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
quote you a final solution
 
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
if there are dependencies in terms of
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
then perhaps it would make sense to go
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
18 months to november so that we
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
actually are in a position where we have
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
the outcomes
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
of the decisions that are being made
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
from that study committee which is
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
intertwined with the potential solution
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee raised a good point
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
of clarification that
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
i neglected to
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
elucidate earlier
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
this extension does last until november
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
of 2023 it doesn't end in may
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
because the current order
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
that it extends ends in november of 2022
 
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
so by
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
extending it by a year it takes it out
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
to november of 2023. okay i'm sorry i
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
didn't clarify that earlier
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative thomas
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
thank you miss cheer i'm i'm sorry i i
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
i try to choose my my words carefully
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
and just for the record
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
i said that i would look at any
 
01:02:26.319 --> 01:02:27.750 align:start position:0%
i said that i would look at any
extension

01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
extension
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
very critically
 
01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
i did not say that i would not be
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
interested i just i would look at it
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
very critically so i just you know just
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
although the broader issue is the forest
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
products industry generally i think the
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
the immediate issue with this bill is
 
01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.190 align:start position:0%
the immediate issue with this bill is
the

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
economic viability of this plant
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
can it be uh continue to be operated
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
just using the rps subsidies it gets or
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
is it viable on its own like the
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
like the smaller biomass plant that
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
operates up there
 
01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:13.990 align:start position:0%
operates up there
is

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
or does it and can it be
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
ever in a place where it will repay that
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
58 million dollar uh
 
01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:23.589 align:start position:0%
58 million dollar uh
debt

01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
debt
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
and we need to understand those
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
economics i think this bill
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
puts us in a position to get that
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
information through the audit so we can
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
make a decision
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
should we go forward and continue to
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
support this kind of operation
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
or does it need some other additional
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
assistance and are we willing to grant
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
that or not
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's what's on the table i
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
support this amendment
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lewicki thank
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
one observation is that this plant does
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
try to operate pretty much continuously
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
except for two weeks shut down
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
and the other plants have the option of
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
running when they choose and so they can
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
choose their time and timing and they
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
can run when the price of electricity is
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
higher and so it's apples and oranges
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
and economically
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
this plant can do the same
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
representative oxenum
 
01:04:21.039 --> 01:04:21.829 align:start position:0%
representative oxenum
uh

01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
one point uh i thank you very much for
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
clearing up the november 23 deadline
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
that that was very helpful
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
um i i asked that perhaps you reconsider
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
your commitment to put in a bill in
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
september of 22
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
and hold off uh and
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
allow that to be a commitment for the
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
lsr window which would be november of 23
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
and would align
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh much much more closely with the um
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
oh it said we don't get a november
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
window when we in a non-election year do
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
we so at least september of 23 for that
 
01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.950 align:start position:0%
we so at least september of 23 for that
window

01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none i think it's time to call
