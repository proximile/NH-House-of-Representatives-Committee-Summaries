him as we enter this life passage with
 
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.110 align:start position:0%
him as we enter this life passage with
art

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
art
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
we obviously challenge our own
 
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
mortality we know that there are only
 
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
two certain things in life and that is
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
that we die we are born and we
 
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
die the question is is what do we do
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
between those two life
 
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
events the last time I was with
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
sleep I have held his warm
 
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
hand and told him of the life that he
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
made a difference in
 
00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
others and as I
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
talked his shallow breathing became
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
deeper and I could feel that he heard my
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
voice in the acknowledgment of his
 
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.189 align:start position:0%
voice in the acknowledgment of his
life's

00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
accomplishments there will surely be
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
regrets I didn't spend enough time what
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
more could I have done we had unfinished
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
business I didn't have a chance to shoot
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
hoops with
 
00:14:40.269 --> 00:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
him but he would say move
 
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
on he would say don't dwell on the
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
current but always move
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
forward the Buddhist faith has the
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
belief in the concept of
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
impermanence that life is Ever
 
00:14:58.749 --> 00:14:58.759 align:start position:0%
Changing life is always moving it never
 
00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
stays stays the
 
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
same we are in that
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
moment we can be sad and we can share
 
00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
the loss of art
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
Ellison but he would say come on come on
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
now let's move
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
on the sorrow of the moment will soon be
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
replaced by the fond memories of the
 
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
past so let's remember art for his
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
contributions to others to our own life
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
but move quickly
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
for what art would say right now would
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
be fight on never give up oh yeah just
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%

population of those three countries
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
then tourism cooperation between Korea
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire will continue to
 
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.040 align:start position:0%

uh on this bill you may recall we uh
 
00:58:32.829 --> 00:58:32.839 align:start position:0%
when the house passed this bill um it
 
00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:35.559 align:start position:0%
contained two Provisions one was a
 
00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
provision to allow um a person who was a
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
a victim of domestic violence to
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
basically um have that as a basis to
 
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
terminate a lease and the second was to
 
00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.559 align:start position:0%
allow a person who was a victim of uh
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
who was who had uh uh been a victim of
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
an accident or illness to uh to uh
 
00:58:59.549 --> 00:58:59.559 align:start position:0%
terminate the lease the Senate removed
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
the second part which really had nothing
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
to do with the main part of the bill
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
that dealt with domestic violence it
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
also made some changes uh to extend the
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
period during which the domestic
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
violence might have occurred I believe
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
our bill said 60 days the Senate
 
00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
increased that to 150 days and it also
 
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
increased uh expanded the types of
 
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
notice that could be given uh by a
 
00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:26.839 align:start position:0%
person who who uh was a vict of domestic
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
violence importantly this is a an
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
important change that the Senate made it
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
creates a new grounds for a landlord to
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
evict a tenant who causes domestic
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
violence um which which made made a lot
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
of sense and the last thing is it is
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
already part of New Hampshire law that a
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
um a person who is a victim of domestic
 
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
violence uh may not be evicted for that
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
purpose alone this uh the Senate version
 
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
expands what uh what types of proof can
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
be offered um to uh by S by such a
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
person uh the Judiciary Committee
 
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
considered all of the changes thought it
 
01:00:13.029 --> 01:00:13.039 align:start position:0%
was appropriate to concur so I recommend
 
01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%

Bill
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
1178 uh is a bill that we heard before
 
01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
the committee and we've had it before
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
the committee many times it's been
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
before this floor we've passed it out of
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
this floor many times before when it
 
01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
came came to the finance committee it
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
came basically with no cost Bill didn't
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
cost us a
 
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
thing what I'm hoping today is that
 
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to overturn this interim
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
study report and recommendation and that
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
we can move on to further further
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
question to pass
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
this the amendment that we have proposed
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
addresses concerns that UNH had and
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
limits the acred time to 30
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
days the bill more important L only
 
01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
affects businesses that have 15 or more
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
employees and it only affects those
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
situations where a business closed is
 
01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
sold or people are laid
 
01:15:38.669 --> 01:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
off now this is important particularly

01:17:15.629 --> 01:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
issue the second employee who had been
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%

February the second person who' been
 
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
there for 10 years was planning on
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
taking two weeks in the summer one week

01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
four weeks of vacation he was going to
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
take one year in this week in the summer
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
one year at Thanksgiving one week at
 
01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
Christmas he got
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
nothing not a
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
thing you may hear that this
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
bill overrides human Union contracts it
 
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't you may say that this is going
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
to affect businesses inappropriately it
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't it affects those people who have
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
been laid off where they promised that
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
they were going to get vacation time and
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
then did not get their vacation time or
 
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
if a business is sold or a business
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
closes They will receive the time that
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
was promised to them in the
 
01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
handbook most handbooks say you only
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
will get your vacation time if you leave
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
employment you give you two weeks notice
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
well when you're laid off or the
 
01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
business closes you can't give two weeks
 
01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.310 align:start position:0%
business closes you can't give two weeks
notice

01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
and so businesses have been using that
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
not to pay AC crude
 
01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
time time that you have worked for and
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
earned many people on high-tech say well
 
01:18:38.189 --> 01:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
we have Flex time they can take as much
 
01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
time as they want well statistics have
 
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
shown that that doesn't always work out
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
and they don't usually get as much time
 
01:18:45.629 --> 01:18:45.639 align:start position:0%
but this bill is not something that is
 
01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
for those people this is something that
 
01:18:50.629 --> 01:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
is for the people who work hard work
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
hourly show up every morning go home
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
every evening or show up every evening
 
01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
and go home every
 
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
morning it's for those people hourly
 
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
employees we're capping this at 30
 
01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
days that recruit time so business would
 
01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
not be responsible for any more than
 
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
that but it's a fair thing to do when
 
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
you came here you came here to represent
 
01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.669 align:start position:0%
you came here you came here to represent
your

01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
constituents those people who go to work
 
01:19:20.189 --> 01:19:20.199 align:start position:0%
in the morning those people who carry
 
01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
the lunch pail this is a bill for them I
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to vote no on this
 
01:19:26.910 --> 01:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
interim study so that we can bring an
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
amendment and an ought to pass motion on
 
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank
 
01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
infantine thank you Mr Speaker the
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
motion on the
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
floor is for inter room
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
study I've learned a lot of things in my
 
01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
tenure here in the legislature if you
 
01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
spare me a minute or two I'm going to
 
01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
tell you a couple things I've
 
01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
learned I was younger years ago and
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative nelli was the speaker of
 
01:19:59.310 --> 01:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
the house and a bill came in front of
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
Labor and it wasn't quite
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
ready it got passed through the house
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
Senate the governor signed the
 
01:20:11.629 --> 01:20:11.639 align:start position:0%
bill the Hue and cry because of the bill
 
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
that came from business owners in New
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire both Democrat Republican and
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
independent was so
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
Furious that the first order of
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
business the second year of the term on
 
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
organization day was to repeal that bill
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
the bill wasn't
 
01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
ready I won't pass another bill
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
again that's not
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
ready I don't think this is
 
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
ready I'm not going to Discount and the
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
second thing I've learned is not to pass
 
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
something in the house when I know in
 
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
here that it's not going to go any
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
further in the other
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
body I don't
 
01:20:53.639 --> 01:20:55.669 align:start position:0%
body I don't
discount

01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
discount
 
01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
what the previous speaker
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
stated the law as it is now needs to be
 
01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
amended needs to be
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
tweaked the bill has three parts to it
 
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
two of which I agree to agree with and
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
would support and have told the sponsor
 
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
I will support at
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
nauseum the third one is
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
not it's not
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
ready and I don't want to go back to
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
what happened the last time
 
01:21:28.030 --> 01:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
that I didn't speak up hard enough that
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
we have to repeal a bill on organization
 
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
day the next day I would
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
if I
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
know that in the interest of fairness to
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
employees and employers who re who value
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
their employees and want to retain them
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
and and have them have long careers
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%

01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
that we should pass uh that we should
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
defeat the interim study and pass the
 
01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
bill Mr Speaker if I know that we don't
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
do one siiz fits all in this in this
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
body and that the fact that a an
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
employer may tell the employee that you
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
have two weeks vacation per year and
 
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
because of my one-size fits-all blanket
 
01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
policy that if uh if I lay you off and
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
it's not your choice I lay you off that
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
you don't get the vacation pay I think
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
that's I think we should shouldn't allow
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
that in the state of New Hampshire and
 
01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
then I would say that we should vote
 
01:23:59.470 --> 01:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
down the interim study and and press the
 
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:02.760 align:start position:0%

01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
conclude and ask you to again press that
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%

$150,000 to be paid for by the American

from the American Rescue plan it doesn't
 
01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
actually ask for any money out of the
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
budget and it also asks that we look at
 
01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
other federal funds that may be
 
01:30:57.109 --> 01:30:57.119 align:start position:0%

01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
lgbtq many families full families that
 
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
are homeless or people that children
 
01:33:04.629 --> 01:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
that are not who are out of their homes
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
for another
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
reason they are being missed with the
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
services that may be available to
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
them the majority report talks about
 
01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
well this increases the age to 25 as
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
well so we're going to pick up a lot of
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
people that that are older and that
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
they're adults well HUD actually
 
01:33:23.070 --> 01:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
redefined what a youth is and it
 
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
basically you look at 13 to 25 Now by
 
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
Hud so if you're looking at federal
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
funds you've got to expand that age
 
01:33:30.990 --> 01:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
group but we're not really looking at
 
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.629 --> 01:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
category last year the office
 
01:33:41.229 --> 01:33:41.239 align:start position:0%
of child advocate had nine sex
 
01:33:41.239 --> 01:33:42.629 align:start position:0%
of child advocate had nine sex
trafficking

01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
trafficking
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
cases in the state of New Hampshire nine
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
and I know that's an important thing for
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of people here because I've heard
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
trafficking but I've got something
 
01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
different sex trafficking you know you
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
take a look at that and that's when a
 
01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
child is forced into
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
sex A N A 2022 study here in New
 
01:34:05.950 --> 01:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire showed that there were 1500
 
01:34:08.830 --> 01:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
homeless school
 
01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
children 40% of them
 
01:34:15.629 --> 01:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
participate now remember these two words
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
I'm they participate in survival
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
sex that's not a choice that they make
 
01:34:25.629 --> 01:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
readily that's not something they've
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
been forced into that's something
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
they're looking for a place to lay their
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
head at night or to get a meal 40% of
 
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
those 1500 students who were surveyed
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
said they participate in survival sex
 
01:34:41.070 --> 01:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
out of 500 proximately 500 college
 
01:34:43.709 --> 01:34:43.719 align:start position:0%

may sleep in a car they may sleep in a
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
tent 26% of them now these are the older
 
01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
ones who may be able to fend for some
 
01:34:55.229 --> 01:34:55.239 align:start position:0%
themselves a little bit bit better 26%
 
01:35:00.669 --> 01:35:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
sex if we're taking a look at survival
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
sex and we're saying it's not important
 
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
that we do something about it by
 
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
bringing another advocate in the
 
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
department who can handle and work with
 
01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
these cases confine these cases and
 
01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:13.270 align:start position:0%

01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr Speaker I do want
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
to thank the gentleman from Rochester
 
01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
for his speech he did lay out the
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
specifics and the facts on this bill uh
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
which I do just want to highlight this
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
bill does expand the role of the office
 
01:35:41.229 --> 01:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate which is currently
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
focused on those kids in the system uh
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
to individuals it this bill would expand
 
01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:49.159 align:start position:0%
their scope to individuals up to the age
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
of 25 that are experiencing homelessness
 
01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
and while the committee certainly felt
 
01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
that and and knows that homelessness is
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
a problem that we have to deal with in
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
our municipalities and throughout the
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire this bill spends
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
money not for one more single bed uh to
 
01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
be opened up in any town or city in the
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
State uh this bill is using onetime
 
01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
federal dollars from the American Rescue
 
01:36:15.149 --> 01:36:15.159 align:start position:0%
plan act that the state has to spend by
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
the end of this year and using that to
 
01:36:20.590 --> 01:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
hire a new state employee expanding the
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
scope of the current Office of the child
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
advocate and in the future we'd have to
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
take that employee and pay them with
 
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars it's not the way we do
 
01:36:31.229 --> 01:36:31.239 align:start position:0%
things here in New Hampshire we use
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
onetime money for one-time expenses uh
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
this money could be better used on more
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
shelters on beds to expand the the need
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
that we have there not on an additional
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
state employee that is simply going to
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
be a coordinator for the alleged
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
resources that are out there that aren't
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
being connected uh to those in need
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
right now um I'm not going to belabor
 
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
the point it is obviously an emotional
 
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
and charged uh topic and and we all have
 
01:36:59.550 --> 01:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
sympathy for the issue uh but expanding
 
01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
the scope of the office of child
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
advocate to individuals up to the age of
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
25 uh using one-time funds for a for
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
forever employee that the state would
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
then be on the hook for is just not a
 
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
sensible policy in my opinion uh and why
 
01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
the finance committee urges you to agree
 
01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
with the majority committee report of
 
01:37:21.149 --> 01:37:21.159 align:start position:0%

01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%

01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
roll call is that sufficiently
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
seconded it is sufficiently seconded
 
01:37:30.109 --> 01:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.440 --> 01:38:22.430 align:start position:0%

01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
motion before us is any exped majority
 
01:38:40.750 --> 01:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
committee report of inexpedient to
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
legislator and House Bill 1199 this is a
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
roll call vote chair recognizes
 
01:38:49.589 --> 01:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
representative long for a parliamentary
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
that very very little understanding of
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
framework are focused on homeless youth
 
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 and above and if I
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
know that all the New Hampshire data
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
shows an increase in this
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
demographic and if I know tens of
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
millions of tax dollars are appropriated
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
in servicing adult homelessness and
 
01:39:13.109 --> 01:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
believe we could reduce that amount by
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
investing at the earliest age and
 
01:39:20.669 --> 01:39:20.679 align:start position:0%
finally if I if I believe 150,000 in Opa
 
01:39:23.070 --> 01:39:23.080 align:start position:0%
funding of this position in the office
 
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
of advocacy gives us the opportunity to
 
01:39:28.109 --> 01:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
begin to complete the circle and deliver
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
in productive citizens than when I press
 
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960 align:start position:0%

01:39:42.990 --> 01:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
if I know that using temporary funding
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
to hire a new employee is not sound
 
01:39:50.589 --> 01:39:50.599 align:start position:0%
financial planning we already have a
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
person in the office of child advocate
 
01:39:54.669 --> 01:39:54.679 align:start position:0%
who was taken on some of this Challenge
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
and if I further know that we also have
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
a special committee working on
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
housing if I know that this may come
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
down to spending money of
 
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
150,000 that would do very little to
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
solve the problem that has been
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
discussed would I now push the green
 
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
button and find some other way to fix
 
01:40:17.709 --> 01:40:17.719 align:start position:0%
this problem thank

unfunded mandate charged to New

has already an existing higher
 
03:39:13.269 --> 03:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
educational disciplinary process that's
 
03:39:16.750 --> 03:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate and fair and if I also know
 
03:39:18.550 --> 03:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire taxpayers have
 
03:39:20.189 --> 03:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
already paid for the New Hampshire court
 
03:39:23.030 --> 03:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
system that guarantees and to protect

unfairness within the higher education
 
03:42:18.309 --> 03:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
disciplinary process so that a more

robust due process right system is
 
03:42:22.670 --> 03:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
assured when students faculty or

or termination the sponsors say more due
 
03:42:31.870 --> 03:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
process equals more fairness and more
 
03:42:34.990 --> 03:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
fairness that's just a good thing but

03:42:59.630 --> 03:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
because those currently subject to
 
03:43:01.189 --> 03:43:01.199 align:start position:0%

these are all Essential Elements to Du

VI due process
 
03:43:30.309 --> 03:43:30.319 align:start position:0%

conflict of state federal and contract
 
03:43:35.910 --> 03:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
law under this law state law would be
 
03:43:37.990 --> 03:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
required to put a pause on all higher
 
03:43:40.670 --> 03:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
educational disciplinary processes while
 
03:43:42.189 --> 03:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
criminal cases are working through the
 
03:43:44.110 --> 03:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire court system which we all
 
03:43:45.910 --> 03:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
know takes some time
 
03:43:48.469 --> 03:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
but under federal law with millions of
 
03:43:51.309 --> 03:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
in Title 9 funding tied to it that
 
03:43:52.830 --> 03:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
Federal Law requires immediate
 
03:43:54.870 --> 03:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
protective order enforcement for cases
 
03:43:57.149 --> 03:43:57.159 align:start position:0%

violence and racial
 
03:44:00.910 --> 03:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination further this bill would
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
put into state law a direct conflict
 
03:44:04.990 --> 03:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
with collective bargaining agreements in

the higher educational Community for
 
03:44:09.630 --> 03:44:09.640 align:start position:0%

03:44:11.870 --> 03:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
have shared governance agreements and
 
03:44:14.030 --> 03:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
independent AR arbitration clauses built
 
03:44:16.149 --> 03:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
in to their
 
03:44:19.469 --> 03:44:19.479 align:start position:0%

03:44:21.269 --> 03:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
attention paid to the unintended
 
03:44:23.389 --> 03:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
consequences of this bill with all the
 
03:44:25.510 --> 03:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
focus on the rights of the accused there
 
03:44:27.790 --> 03:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
was no concern about the absence of

03:44:40.149 --> 03:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
tied to this bill although it's clear
 
03:44:42.590 --> 03:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
there would be a significant increase in
 
03:44:43.990 --> 03:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's higher Educational

03:44:48.309 --> 03:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
right the university system anticipates
 
03:44:50.830 --> 03:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
a$1 to2 million increase and the
 
03:44:52.990 --> 03:44:53.000 align:start position:0%

$370,000 increases of expenses per year
 
03:44:59.670 --> 03:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
to comply with this bill so make no
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
mistake hb1 1288 is an unfunded a hefty
 
03:45:06.750 --> 03:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded Mandate of state
 
03:45:10.630 --> 03:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
law one more number zero zero estimates
 
03:45:13.550 --> 03:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
of the true cost the true unknown but
 
03:45:15.469 --> 03:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
very significant legal cost
 
03:45:17.910 --> 03:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
to defend New Hampshire's Educational
 
03:45:20.950 --> 03:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
Systems under this bill taxpayers will
 
03:45:24.349 --> 03:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
ultimately pay the price in the probably
 
03:45:26.510 --> 03:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
Millions to litigate this bill and
 
03:45:29.309 --> 03:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
believe me litigation will be coming Mr
 
03:45:32.030 --> 03:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker those numbers don't make sense
 
03:45:33.670 --> 03:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
but here are two numbers that do make
 
03:45:36.990 --> 03:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
sense one one existing New Hampshire
 
03:45:38.950 --> 03:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
court system that is already established
 
03:45:41.630 --> 03:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
and paid for by New Hampshire
 
03:45:43.790 --> 03:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that guarantees our due
 
03:45:46.630 --> 03:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
process rights this
 
03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
bill and the many other fundamental
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
freedoms that are guaranteed under our
 
03:45:52.429 --> 03:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
state constitution and our Federal
 
03:45:54.910 --> 03:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution one New Hampshire judicial
 
03:45:57.189 --> 03:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
system that has worked efficiently and
 
03:45:59.309 --> 03:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
effectively for hundreds of years and
 
03:46:01.110 --> 03:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
under which the current higher education
 
03:46:03.309 --> 03:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
systems disciplinary process
 
03:46:08.870 --> 03:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
honors and one one hb1 1288 is one heck
 
03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
of an example of a fine jobs bill this
 
03:46:13.510 --> 03:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
bill if
 
03:46:16.189 --> 03:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
enacted should forever be known as the
 
03:46:18.110 --> 03:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
make New Hampshire higher ed acquire
 
03:46:20.590 --> 03:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
great attorneys act because as far as I
 
03:46:22.870 --> 03:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
can tell the major beneficiary of the
 
03:46:25.269 --> 03:46:25.279 align:start position:0%
secondary quasi judicial process within
 
03:46:27.590 --> 03:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
the state H Ed will be the members of
 
03:46:30.269 --> 03:46:30.279 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Bar Association and
 
03:46:32.070 --> 03:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of all the members i' like to
 
03:46:33.750 --> 03:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank the sponsors for establishing the
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
title wave of impending new jobs for
 
03:46:38.670 --> 03:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys to litigate the truly novel
 
03:46:40.309 --> 03:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
cases of New Hampshire state law
 
03:46:41.590 --> 03:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
conflicting with federal law and
 
03:46:44.269 --> 03:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
breaches of contract all parties will be
 
03:46:46.550 --> 03:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
more likely to lawyer up and come on who
 
03:46:49.269 --> 03:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't like more
 
03:46:53.550 --> 03:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
lawyers so 1 plus 1 equals 2 that maap
 
03:46:54.950 --> 03:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
that maap definitely checks out Mr
 
03:46:56.830 --> 03:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker and that's two solid reasons for
 
03:47:00.710 --> 03:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
you to oppose the OTP motion finally hb1
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
1288 is a fiscally irresponsible bill
 
03:47:05.550 --> 03:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
when we already have an existing higher
 
03:47:07.590 --> 03:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
educational disciplin disciplinary
 
03:47:09.990 --> 03:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
process that's appropriate and fair and
 
03:47:11.870 --> 03:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
when taxpayers have already paid for the
 
03:47:13.469 --> 03:47:13.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire court system that
 
03:47:15.910 --> 03:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
guarantees our due process rights
 
03:47:18.229 --> 03:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
when that process fails for these
 
03:47:20.110 --> 03:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
reasons Mr Speaker I urge you to vote no
 
03:47:23.030 --> 03:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
on the OTP motion so that another more
 
03:47:25.189 --> 03:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
fiscally prudent motion may be made
 
03:47:27.550 --> 03:47:27.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker chair recognize
 
03:47:27.560 --> 03:47:32.590 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker chair recognize
representative

03:47:32.590 --> 03:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:35.149 --> 03:47:35.159 align:start position:0%
Lynn thank you m thank you Mr Speaker I
 
03:47:37.189 --> 03:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
Rise as I did two weeks ago or maybe
 
03:47:39.349 --> 03:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
three weeks ago in support of the ought
 
03:47:42.790 --> 03:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
to pass motion on this bill uh as was
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
just noted this bill establishes certain
 
03:47:48.110 --> 03:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
due process rights for faculty students
 
03:47:50.590 --> 03:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
or student organizations that are facing
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
disciplinary significant disciplinary
 
03:47:55.070 --> 03:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
action involving suspensions
 
03:47:58.229 --> 03:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
Etc one of the things we didn't hear in
 
03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
from the prior speaker is which of the
 
03:48:02.349 --> 03:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
rights that I'll read to you now are
 
03:48:04.830 --> 03:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
somehow unfair the right to notice of
 
03:48:07.189 --> 03:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
the charges to advanc disclosure of
 
03:48:08.910 --> 03:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
witnesses and evidence to the
 
03:48:10.229 --> 03:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
presumption of innocence and a
 
03:48:14.630 --> 03:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
requirement that that the the uh the AL
 
03:48:17.110 --> 03:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
the the uh complainant Prov the case by
 
03:48:19.229 --> 03:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
a preponderance of the evidence the
 
03:48:20.469 --> 03:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
privilege against
 
03:48:22.309 --> 03:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
self-incrimination the right to confront
 
03:48:24.710 --> 03:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
and cross examine Witnesses the right to
 
03:48:26.349 --> 03:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
an impartial hearings officer and I
 
03:48:29.389 --> 03:48:29.399 align:start position:0%
could go on which of those is is a right
 
03:48:32.229 --> 03:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
that's unfair I submit to you that none
 
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
of them are the argument here by the by
 
03:48:38.910 --> 03:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
the university system is on the one hand
 
03:48:41.349 --> 03:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
they say oh our system is just fine
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
there's no problem don't worry about it
 
03:48:47.189 --> 03:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
well if that's true then there is no
 
03:48:49.309 --> 03:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill either because
 
03:48:52.950 --> 03:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
this bill says if you have an equivalent
 
03:48:55.630 --> 03:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
system then you can continue to use your
 
03:48:58.670 --> 03:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
system and while we did hear complaints
 
03:49:00.469 --> 03:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
during this whole process from the
 
03:49:02.790 --> 03:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
University system one of the things that
 
03:49:04.550 --> 03:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
was very interesting if this was going
 
03:49:07.510 --> 03:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
to upset all these established
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
procedures that unions and and and uh
 
03:49:13.550 --> 03:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
the the school schools had agreed to you
 
03:49:15.429 --> 03:49:15.439 align:start position:0%
might think that some time during the
 
03:49:17.110 --> 03:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
hearing process we would have heard some
 
03:49:19.149 --> 03:49:19.159 align:start position:0%
people from the union saying oh don't do
 
03:49:21.750 --> 03:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
this this will be terrible if you do it
 
03:49:25.990 --> 03:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
we heard Zero from the unions because
 
03:49:28.309 --> 03:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
they they this is not going to be some
 
03:49:30.670 --> 03:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
huge problem the last point that I'll
 
03:49:33.630 --> 03:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
make is this the suggestion that there
 
03:49:36.590 --> 03:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
somehow is a conflict between this and
 
03:49:38.790 --> 03:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
federal law and that we're going to get
 
03:49:41.550 --> 03:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
sued I'll tell you stop and think about
 
03:49:43.550 --> 03:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
this this would be the federal
 
03:49:45.790 --> 03:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
government's argument for trying to
 
03:49:48.590 --> 03:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
defund New Hampshire because we had this
 
03:49:52.469 --> 03:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
law well we should defund New Hampshire
 
03:49:55.990 --> 03:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
because they have a system in place to

Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
03:52:04.349 --> 03:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
current system is efficient expeditious
 
03:52:07.189 --> 03:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
and cost effective and if I know that
 
03:52:09.429 --> 03:52:09.439 align:start position:0%
our Prime sponsor has joined many others
 
03:52:11.710 --> 03:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
in commending our University system for
 
03:52:13.349 --> 03:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
the highly professional manner in which
 
03:52:15.510 --> 03:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
it deals with these complaints lengths
 
03:52:17.910 --> 03:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill only adds
 
03:52:20.550 --> 03:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
another layer of bureaucracy and red
 
03:52:22.950 --> 03:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
tape to A system that is already

addressing the concerns expressed in
 
03:52:27.590 --> 03:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
this bill and if I know that this bill
 
03:52:29.990 --> 03:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
has an unknown fiscal component that
 
03:52:32.030 --> 03:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
could be very expensive and at the same
 
03:52:34.830 --> 03:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
time this bill could put into Jeopardy
 
03:52:37.389 --> 03:52:37.399 align:start position:0%

institutions of higher education I can't
 
03:53:06.510 --> 03:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
find a lot wrong with that and if I also
 
03:53:09.149 --> 03:53:09.159 align:start position:0%
know that according to testimony from
 
03:53:11.429 --> 03:53:11.439 align:start position:0%

overburdensome task for 80 hearings

with strong bipartisan support this bill
 
04:30:14.189 --> 04:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 15 1995 also deals with child
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
support but questions
 
04:30:19.510 --> 04:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
remain advocates for families and
 
04:30:21.590 --> 04:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
children like Waypoint New Hampshire
 
04:30:23.790 --> 04:30:23.800 align:start position:0%
Association of justice and New Hampshire
 
04:30:26.550 --> 04:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
Legal Assistant all expressed serious
 
04:30:28.630 --> 04:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
concerns with how the bill addresses
 
04:30:31.389 --> 04:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
unique situations where abuse
 
04:30:34.590 --> 04:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
exists the bottom line is House Bill
 
04:30:37.429 --> 04:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
1595 relies on parenting time in the
 
04:30:40.590 --> 04:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
calculation of child support and that in
 
04:30:43.870 --> 04:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
and of itself is inherently problematic
 
04:30:46.070 --> 04:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
in cases of domestic violence or
 
04:30:47.349 --> 04:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
situations of
 
04:30:50.070 --> 04:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
abuse making a direct connection between
 
04:30:52.510 --> 04:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
parenting time and support is highly
 
04:30:54.349 --> 04:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
concerning and putting a premium on
 
04:30:57.429 --> 04:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
parenting time sets up situations ripe
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
for abuse and does not put the child's
 
04:31:03.309 --> 04:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
well-being Above All Else due to the
 
04:31:05.950 --> 04:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
complexities around the issue the
 
04:31:07.990 --> 04:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee believes it
 
04:31:10.389 --> 04:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
would be more prudent to interim study
 
04:31:13.870 --> 04:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1595 to fully understand the
 
04:31:16.710 --> 04:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
impact of the bill this bill will have a
 
04:31:19.030 --> 04:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
significant change on determining child
 
04:31:21.670 --> 04:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
support but we need to be sure that
 
04:31:24.309 --> 04:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children won't be at risk the
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
bill needs to SC be scrutinized further
 
04:31:29.469 --> 04:31:29.479 align:start position:0%
to ensure without question that the
 
04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
well-being of every child is first and
 
04:31:34.870 --> 04:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
foremost in all
 
04:31:38.070 --> 04:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
situations please join me in pushing the
 
04:31:40.910 --> 04:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
red button to overturn the ought to pass
 
04:31:43.550 --> 04:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
as amended motion so another motion can
 
04:31:45.790 --> 04:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
be made and I ask for a division vote
 
04:31:47.750 --> 04:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
04:31:49.790 --> 04:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
Speaker representative Edwards is
 
04:31:52.429 --> 04:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
recognize to speak for the committee
 
04:31:55.590 --> 04:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
report uh thank you Mr Speaker uh I
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
think what division did uh three did was
 
04:32:01.030 --> 04:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh actually not out of incompetence but
 
04:32:03.670 --> 04:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh Brilliance I'll say because what we
 
04:32:07.189 --> 04:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
noticed was uh 1564 and
 
04:32:10.990 --> 04:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
1595 affected the same it system and
 
04:32:13.109 --> 04:32:13.119 align:start position:0%
because it would have affected the same
 
04:32:17.229 --> 04:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
it system what we recognized was that uh
 
04:32:20.670 --> 04:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
the the cost to do 1564 and
 
04:32:23.590 --> 04:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
1595 uh were the same and so since we
 
04:32:26.870 --> 04:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
passed 1564 on a Voice vote essentially
 
04:32:29.950 --> 04:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
1595 no longer has a financial
 
04:32:32.750 --> 04:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
implication because it's free so that
 
04:32:34.790 --> 04:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
was not incompetence that was done
 
04:32:37.109 --> 04:32:37.119 align:start position:0%
intentionally and for good reason the
 
04:32:38.830 --> 04:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
what the amendment you just voted for
 
04:32:43.429 --> 04:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
did is it agreed with 59 95 and 1564
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
took the definitions out of 1564 and
 
04:32:48.870 --> 04:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
brought them into 1595 to be in
 
04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
accordance with one another and it
 
04:32:53.670 --> 04:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
established after years and years of
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
independent reports cost of about
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
$400,000 total that there ought to be an
 
04:33:03.910 --> 04:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
independent uh formula involved so that
 
04:33:07.390 --> 04:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
in these very uh confrontational periods
 
04:33:10.510 --> 04:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
of time in the family court system that
 
04:33:13.789 --> 04:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
there is some basis upon which the cost
 
04:33:16.789 --> 04:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
allocation between parents is shared in
 
04:33:20.150 --> 04:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
a parent co-sharing Arrangement and so
 
04:33:22.629 --> 04:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
as a starting point not the conclusion
 
04:33:25.390 --> 04:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
point is that has been left to float out
 
04:33:28.590 --> 04:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
there as a starting point the formula
 
04:33:31.670 --> 04:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
provides everyone with a common view of
 
04:33:34.470 --> 04:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
what would be fair in this in this case
 
04:33:37.470 --> 04:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
and then the as always the judge has the
 
04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
discretion to make whatever
 
04:33:41.990 --> 04:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
determination he or she wants for the
 
04:33:44.910 --> 04:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
best interests of the child this this
 
04:33:48.269 --> 04:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
bill has been in being made now for two
 
04:33:51.429 --> 04:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
three terms uh we're right there let's
 
04:33:54.510 --> 04:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
get this uh formula in so so that Family
 
04:33:58.390 --> 04:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
Court can be less hellish than it is now
 
04:34:01.470 --> 04:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
so please vote green on the
 
04:34:03.429 --> 04:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
otpa thank
 
04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
you a division votes been requested this
 
04:34:07.910 --> 04:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
will be a division vote members please
 
04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%

04:35:02.830 --> 04:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:04.109 --> 04:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
questions on the majority committee
 
04:35:06.230 --> 04:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
report of about to pass as amended this
 
04:35:08.750 --> 04:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
is a division vote representative money
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:19.070 --> 04:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues if I
 
04:35:21.910 --> 04:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
know that we need to update our child
 
04:35:24.869 --> 04:35:24.879 align:start position:0%
support guidelines to more clearly
 
04:35:29.189 --> 04:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
address shared parenting for parents but
 
04:35:32.590 --> 04:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is overly complicated making
 
04:35:35.709 --> 04:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
it difficult for many self-represented
 
04:35:40.390 --> 04:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
parents to use and could cause more
 
04:35:42.551 --> 04:35:42.561 align:start position:0%
drawn out custom
 
04:35:46.990 --> 04:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
disputes and if I know that house bill
 
04:35:52.830 --> 04:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
1564 which we just passed overwhelmingly
 
04:35:57.310 --> 04:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
unanimously is simpler fairer and
 
04:35:59.189 --> 04:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
addresses issues that have been
 
04:36:03.789 --> 04:36:03.799 align:start position:0%
lingering on this very subject since
 
04:36:08.949 --> 04:36:08.959 align:start position:0%
2018 lastly if I know that we should be
 
04:36:12.269 --> 04:36:12.279 align:start position:0%
decisive when spending State funds and
 
04:36:16.269 --> 04:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
therefore send only one good bill to the
 
04:36:19.629 --> 04:36:19.639 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall rather than two
 
04:36:21.629 --> 04:36:21.639 align:start position:0%
potentially conflicting
 
04:36:25.590 --> 04:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
bills then would I press the red button
 
04:36:29.429 --> 04:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
so that an inim study motion can be made
 
04:36:29.439 --> 04:36:31.789 align:start position:0%
so that an inim study motion can be made

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
that house bill 1595 is important for a

formula that it contains that is well
 
04:36:50.470 --> 04:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
supported by all the courts and if I
 
04:36:52.269 --> 04:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
know that the opposition to it wants it
 
04:36:54.910 --> 04:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
to delve more into domestic violence
 
04:36:56.789 --> 04:36:56.799 align:start position:0%
which was not a subject before us in

floor amendment is 2 in long not 2 in
 
04:43:14.990 --> 04:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
thick it is a correct some language that
 
04:43:17.590 --> 04:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
in committee we clarified that the rul
 
04:43:19.670 --> 04:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
making would be just um have some
 
04:43:22.390 --> 04:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
distrct control I had accidentally used
 
04:43:24.430 --> 04:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
the F-word franchise but it's an agency
 
04:43:26.590 --> 04:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
model so that's corrected the other is
 
04:43:28.230 --> 04:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
to be fair to cities so that if they're
 
04:43:30.430 --> 04:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
voting in the future they won't be have
 
04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
to wait until the next state election
 
04:43:33.550 --> 04:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to vote in the next next
 
04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
election if they turn it down the first
 
04:43:36.830 --> 04:43:36.840 align:start position:0%

report thank you Mr Speaker I Rise to
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
oppose any legalization of cannabis also
 
04:44:13.270 --> 04:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
known as
 
04:44:15.670 --> 04:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
marijuana we now have the examples of
 
04:44:17.788 --> 04:44:17.798 align:start position:0%
many other states that have legalized
 
04:44:20.990 --> 04:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
this substance over the past few years
 
04:44:23.390 --> 04:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
have any of them bragged about how much
 
04:44:26.628 --> 04:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
money they made have any of them seen a
 
04:44:28.830 --> 04:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
reduction in petty
 
04:44:31.670 --> 04:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
crime we have a system of alternative
 
04:44:34.470 --> 04:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
treatment centers that are now serving
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
14,000 patients who have prescriptions
 
04:44:38.230 --> 04:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
drug casual use has caused problem
 
04:44:44.590 --> 04:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
problems especially for our youth States
 
04:44:47.390 --> 04:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
legalizing this substance report
 
04:44:49.750 --> 04:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
increases in gang activities and violent
 
04:44:51.910 --> 04:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
crime as well as problems in mental
 
04:44:55.110 --> 04:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
health and Highway Safety they have not
 
04:44:57.910 --> 04:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
eliminated the illegal black market and
 
04:44:59.750 --> 04:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
the drug especially when they place a
 
04:45:01.948 --> 04:45:01.958 align:start position:0%
tax on it to raise
 
04:45:04.350 --> 04:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
revenue I read that the state of Oregon
 
04:45:07.070 --> 04:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
is having second thoughts and is making
 
04:45:08.510 --> 04:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
changes in
 
04:45:10.708 --> 04:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement we remember will suspend for
 
04:45:11.910 --> 04:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
a minute
 
04:45:14.708 --> 04:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
wicked noisy so if we're leaving let's
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
try to leave quietly and then talk once
 
04:45:20.910 --> 04:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
the doors are closed back there
 
04:45:23.510 --> 04:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
continue we have witnessed enough second
 
04:45:25.788 --> 04:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
thoughts in states that legalize
 
04:45:28.788 --> 04:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
marijuana to realize that this is no
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
route for New Hampshire to follow down
 
04:45:34.110 --> 04:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
that rat hole please vote no on this
 
04:45:37.750 --> 04:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:41.430 --> 04:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
you represent representative Ford's Rec
 
04:45:50.910 --> 04:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:53.430 --> 04:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr
 
04:45:55.430 --> 04:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
speaker thank you
 
04:45:58.670 --> 04:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues I rise today to speak
 
04:46:00.990 --> 04:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
against uh
 
04:46:05.788 --> 04:46:05.798 align:start position:0%
1633 my reasons are both personal and if
 
04:46:08.470 --> 04:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
you will health
 
04:46:13.150 --> 04:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:15.868 --> 04:46:15.878 align:start position:0%
who has prefrontal
 
04:46:19.350 --> 04:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
dementia as a sequence to using
 
04:46:22.590 --> 04:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
marijuana regularly for a number of
 
04:46:25.310 --> 04:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
years I won't get into the arguments
 
04:46:28.430 --> 04:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
about causality or whatever it's very
 
04:46:31.070 --> 04:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
technical and I'm not sure it's
 
04:46:34.708 --> 04:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
conclusive but the consequence is that
 
04:46:38.670 --> 04:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
what was once a vibrant young
 
04:46:41.830 --> 04:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
mother is now a person who needs a
 
04:46:45.510 --> 04:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
full-time personal care
 
04:46:49.548 --> 04:46:49.558 align:start position:0%
attendant she does not recognize her own
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
grandchildren when they gathered with
 
04:46:54.628 --> 04:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
her at Christmas they asked does Grandma
 
04:46:58.548 --> 04:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
know we're here does she know my name
 
04:47:01.990 --> 04:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:06.150 --> 04:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
back she does not even know she is
 
04:47:08.510 --> 04:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
married can you
 
04:47:11.430 --> 04:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
imagine being married to someone
 
04:47:15.548 --> 04:47:15.558 align:start position:0%
who doesn't even recognize
 
04:47:19.750 --> 04:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
you and her family still cares for her
 
04:47:22.470 --> 04:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
she needs that constant
 
04:47:24.830 --> 04:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
attention therefore I would urge you to
 
04:47:26.390 --> 04:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
think very
 
04:47:28.990 --> 04:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
seriously about making
 
04:47:31.788 --> 04:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
accessible and this is not a distant in
 
04:47:35.390 --> 04:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
the past oldtime kind of marijuana this
 
04:47:35.400 --> 04:47:36.628 align:start position:0%
the past oldtime kind of marijuana this
is

04:47:36.628 --> 04:47:36.638 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
current she's still
 
04:47:39.840 --> 04:47:41.510 align:start position:0%
current she's still
living

04:47:41.510 --> 04:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
living
 
04:47:43.830 --> 04:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
but when you get together at Christmas
 
04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
she walks past you as though you were a
 
04:47:47.150 --> 04:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
person on the
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
street she doesn't even know who her own
 
04:47:50.280 --> 04:47:53.110 align:start position:0%
street she doesn't even know who her own
brother

04:47:53.110 --> 04:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:56.270 --> 04:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
is she knows no
 
04:48:00.270 --> 04:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
one without affect totally without
 
04:48:04.948 --> 04:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
affect and without affect there's no
 
04:48:09.270 --> 04:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:13.070 --> 04:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
recognition I can not in any way imagine
 
04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
approving of access to a substance that
 
04:48:21.548 --> 04:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
could even what causal or not bring
 
04:48:22.750 --> 04:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
about that
 
04:48:24.830 --> 04:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
consequence and therefore I cannot
 
04:48:28.750 --> 04:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:31.070 --> 04:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
bill representative lon's recognized
 
04:48:34.948 --> 04:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:38.110 --> 04:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker no matter
 
04:48:40.150 --> 04:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
what we do today and no matter what
 
04:48:42.430 --> 04:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately happens with this bill there
 
04:48:43.948 --> 04:48:43.958 align:start position:0%
are a large number of people in New
 
04:48:46.230 --> 04:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that use cannabis telling them
 
04:48:47.948 --> 04:48:47.958 align:start position:0%
it's illegal and they shouldn't use it
 
04:48:50.310 --> 04:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
hasn't worked so I'm not sure how that
 
04:48:52.430 --> 04:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
will stop anybody from using
 
04:48:55.628 --> 04:48:55.638 align:start position:0%
cannabis moving to a discussion about
 
04:48:57.750 --> 04:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
why children shouldn't use it because of
 
04:48:59.788 --> 04:48:59.798 align:start position:0%
the brain development is a lot more
 
04:49:01.470 --> 04:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
honest conversation when you can talk
 
04:49:03.430 --> 04:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
about the science instead of just saying
 
04:49:05.270 --> 04:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's illegal don't do
 
04:49:08.270 --> 04:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
it the problem right now is a lot of
 
04:49:10.510 --> 04:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
people who choose to use cannabis um
 
04:49:12.948 --> 04:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
either either can drive out of state
 
04:49:14.910 --> 04:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
they can illegally grow it at home or
 
04:49:16.670 --> 04:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
they can buy it on the streets and
 
04:49:18.548 --> 04:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
there's issues with buying it on the
 
04:49:21.190 --> 04:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
streets what this bill would change is
 
04:49:23.548 --> 04:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
you could have regulated tested product
 
04:49:25.910 --> 04:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's free of contaminants and that is
 
04:49:28.670 --> 04:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
not mixed with other drugs you would
 
04:49:30.510 --> 04:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
know what was in it you would know what
 
04:49:33.150 --> 04:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
strain you would know what concentration
 
04:49:35.150 --> 04:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
so for those who would choose to do it
 
04:49:36.110 --> 04:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
04:49:39.350 --> 04:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
safer and for everybody else it wouldn't
 
04:49:40.948 --> 04:49:40.958 align:start position:0%
be a discussion that you're having
 
04:49:42.750 --> 04:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
because most people who would use
 
04:49:45.868 --> 04:49:45.878 align:start position:0%
cannabis if it's legal already are the
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
rule followers aren't going to be the
 
04:49:49.510 --> 04:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
problem but let's talk a little bit
 
04:49:51.910 --> 04:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
about what this bill specifically does
 
04:49:54.590 --> 04:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
this meets just about every requirement
 
04:49:56.270 --> 04:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
every requirement that was previously
 
04:49:58.628 --> 04:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
laid out in order to become law there
 
04:50:00.628 --> 04:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
was a last minute change to require a
 
04:50:02.910 --> 04:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
franchise where the language required
 
04:50:04.750 --> 04:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
that the FR it seemed that the franchise
 
04:50:07.430 --> 04:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
agreements would be done in secret this
 
04:50:10.190 --> 04:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
bill makes it so that the agency model
 
04:50:13.670 --> 04:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
has strong control but those rules about
 
04:50:15.030 --> 04:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
how they operate would be done through
 
04:50:16.350 --> 04:50:16.360 align:start position:0%
administrative rules so there'd be
 
04:50:18.628 --> 04:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
public comment it also doesn't set
 
04:50:21.788 --> 04:50:21.798 align:start position:0%
prices I think this is an excellent Bill
 
04:50:23.628 --> 04:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly I think it's time for
 
04:50:26.270 --> 04:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
us to go ahead and vote on this bill and
 
04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
let the other body deal with it so I'd
 
04:50:32.300 --> 04:50:32.310 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
04:58:25.590 --> 04:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
I if I know that this amendment moves
 
04:58:28.270 --> 04:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
merely moves the implementation date of
 
04:58:31.990 --> 04:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
this regulation forward 18
 
04:58:35.350 --> 04:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
months and if I know it's been said that
 
04:58:37.310 --> 04:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
our finance committee should not be
 
04:58:41.868 --> 04:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
involved in making policy changes
 
04:58:43.990 --> 04:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
and if I know that there's no Financial
 
04:58:47.548 --> 04:58:47.558 align:start position:0%
reason to implement this regulation
 
04:58:50.548 --> 04:58:50.558 align:start position:0%
sooner and if I know that any purported
 
04:58:55.150 --> 04:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
savings by extra regulation are purely
 
04:58:57.708 --> 04:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
fanciful would I then press the red
 
04:59:00.628 --> 04:59:00.638 align:start position:0%

04:59:01.948 --> 04:59:01.958 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
04:59:14.910 --> 04:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
that HB 1649 is amended by Commerce
 
04:59:17.548 --> 04:59:17.558 align:start position:0%
removed many manufacturer requirements
 
04:59:19.708 --> 04:59:19.718 align:start position:0%
leading up to the original effective
 
04:59:22.350 --> 04:59:22.360 align:start position:0%
date of the ban of the sale of consumer
 
04:59:24.750 --> 04:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
products with intentionally added
 
04:59:27.590 --> 04:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
pasas and if I know that an earlier
 
04:59:30.070 --> 04:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
effective date of the prohibition better
 
04:59:33.350 --> 04:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
protects Public Health which is critical
 
04:59:36.948 --> 04:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
in the face of widespread pasas
 
04:59:40.190 --> 04:59:40.200 align:start position:0%

04:59:44.628 --> 04:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
issued new tighter P Water maximum

starting to remove pasas from consumer
 
04:59:56.470 --> 04:59:56.480 align:start position:0%

05:01:41.150 --> 05:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
Speaker House Bill 1649 is is too
 
05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
broad it not only affects the nasty
 
05:01:48.190 --> 05:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
stuff that's causing problems in marac
 
05:01:51.070 --> 05:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
but it sweeps along thousands of other
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
things that are only marginally related
 
05:01:56.110 --> 05:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
to those
 
05:01:58.548 --> 05:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
chemicals when we considered this bill
 
05:02:01.470 --> 05:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
in the finance committee we were told
 
05:02:04.030 --> 05:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
several times that the bill is not
 
05:02:07.430 --> 05:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
breaking new ground that it's just
 
05:02:10.350 --> 05:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
implementing bands that already exist in
 
05:02:10.360 --> 05:02:11.350 align:start position:0%
implementing bands that already exist in
other

05:02:11.350 --> 05:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:02:14.390 --> 05:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
states I investigated what the state of
 
05:02:18.150 --> 05:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
California is doing in this area and
 
05:02:22.190 --> 05:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
California is a state with over 25 times
 
05:02:22.200 --> 05:02:23.310 align:start position:0%
California is a state with over 25 times
our

05:02:23.310 --> 05:02:23.320 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:02:26.548 --> 05:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
population and it correspondingly has a
 
05:02:28.070 --> 05:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
much larger
 
05:02:30.830 --> 05:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
Dees and much more capability of
 
05:02:30.840 --> 05:02:32.670 align:start position:0%

05:02:32.670 --> 05:02:32.680 align:start position:0%

05:02:34.990 --> 05:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
regulation they have a large enough
 
05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
market that manufacturers and retailers
 
05:02:40.910 --> 05:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
will cater to their their
 
05:02:42.948 --> 05:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
regulations we do
 
05:02:46.910 --> 05:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
not if we enact honorous regulation
 
05:02:50.230 --> 05:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
producers May simply quit our
 
05:02:53.310 --> 05:02:53.320 align:start position:0%
Market this is particularly true if we
 
05:02:57.430 --> 05:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
enact regulation that is in excess of
 
05:03:00.868 --> 05:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:03.868 --> 05:03:03.878 align:start position:0%
does this amendment concerns the
 
05:03:06.470 --> 05:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph in the bill that defines food
 
05:03:08.750 --> 05:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
packaging to be
 
05:03:12.070 --> 05:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
banned it is word for word what
 
05:03:16.230 --> 05:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
California has in their P
 
05:03:19.948 --> 05:03:19.958 align:start position:0%
laws it regulates mostly disposable
 
05:03:22.830 --> 05:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
paper and cardboard items that contain
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
food and beverage like bags cups and
 
05:03:29.830 --> 05:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
boxes and it also includes utensils and
 
05:03:33.990 --> 05:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
straws these items according to the FDA
 
05:03:38.430 --> 05:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
are the primary source of pasas in the
 
05:03:41.750 --> 05:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
diet the FDA announced this past
 
05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
February that grease prooof substances
 
05:03:48.270 --> 05:03:48.280 align:start position:0%

Bill
 
05:04:11.270 --> 05:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
1649 is that it goes far far beyond what
 
05:04:14.868 --> 05:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
California and the FDA are
 
05:04:18.590 --> 05:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
regulating it regulates the outside of
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
the container and the outside of the

shipping
 
05:04:26.150 --> 05:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
carton uh as much as the
 
05:04:29.948 --> 05:04:29.958 align:start position:0%
inside it specifically regulates labels
 
05:04:34.430 --> 05:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
and the inks used to print them on every
 
05:04:38.990 --> 05:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
food and beverage box can bottle and bag
 
05:04:41.430 --> 05:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
found in the the grocery
 
05:04:45.190 --> 05:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
store strangely it it doesn't regulate
 
05:04:48.990 --> 05:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
labels and ink on anything else like
 
05:04:52.590 --> 05:04:52.600 align:start position:0%

okay

05:04:56.910 --> 05:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:04:59.830 --> 05:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
PTFE which is the chemical name for
 
05:05:03.110 --> 05:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
teflon is widely used in the printing
 
05:05:05.910 --> 05:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
industry in inks and
 
05:05:08.628 --> 05:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
Coatings it's what gives printed
 
05:05:11.788 --> 05:05:11.798 align:start position:0%
material it's rub
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
resistance when you handle a can in the
 
05:05:16.708 --> 05:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
grocery store the ink doesn't come off
 
05:05:20.110 --> 05:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
on your fingers that's frequently the
 
05:05:23.310 --> 05:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
the um result of Teflon being used in
 
05:05:25.788 --> 05:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
the ink or in the
 
05:05:29.590 --> 05:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
coating but Teflon is included in the
 
05:05:34.270 --> 05:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 1649 definition of past to be
 
05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
banned even though Teflon is not a
 
05:05:41.150 --> 05:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
harmful chemical
 
05:05:43.030 --> 05:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
if we
 
05:05:45.310 --> 05:05:45.320 align:start position:0%
keep we'll talk about that more on the
 
05:05:49.190 --> 05:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
next Amendment but yes um if we keep

grocery store shelves
 
05:06:14.510 --> 05:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
today please press the green button

05:06:24.750 --> 05:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr
 
05:06:27.670 --> 05:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker I urge this body to reject this
 
05:06:30.070 --> 05:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment proposing to amend the
 
05:06:32.948 --> 05:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
definition of food packaging this
 
05:06:35.030 --> 05:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
definition and this bill were fully
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
vetted by the policy committee the house
 
05:06:39.830 --> 05:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee and passed by this
 
05:06:43.270 --> 05:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
house on a Voice vote without debate to
 
05:06:45.750 --> 05:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
change this def this definition now at
 
05:06:48.670 --> 05:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
this late dat is ill advised and
 
05:06:51.470 --> 05:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
unwise during our finance committee work
 
05:06:54.390 --> 05:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
sessions not one person testified
 
05:06:57.910 --> 05:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
against this bill and certainly no one
 
05:07:00.350 --> 05:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
took issue with the definition of food
 
05:07:04.868 --> 05:07:04.878 align:start position:0%
packaging the current HB 1649 definition
 
05:07:08.548 --> 05:07:08.558 align:start position:0%
is the policy position of the house food
 
05:07:10.948 --> 05:07:10.958 align:start position:0%
packaging is is one of the leading ways
 
05:07:13.470 --> 05:07:13.480 align:start position:0%
in which we're all exposed to
 
05:07:16.350 --> 05:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
pasas and that is why food packaging is
 
05:07:20.190 --> 05:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
included in this bill pasts are in many
 
05:07:22.510 --> 05:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
forms of packaging from microwave
 
05:07:25.030 --> 05:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
popcorn to french fry bags to paper
 
05:07:27.708 --> 05:07:27.718 align:start position:0%
plates because of their anti-stick
 
05:07:30.548 --> 05:07:30.558 align:start position:0%
properties and while it is true the
 
05:07:32.830 --> 05:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
predominant use of pasas in food
 
05:07:35.548 --> 05:07:35.558 align:start position:0%
packaging is in connection with Paper
 
05:07:35.558 --> 05:07:37.070 align:start position:0%
packaging is in connection with Paper
Products

05:07:37.070 --> 05:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
Products
 
05:07:40.510 --> 05:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
Research also indicates that this is not
 
05:07:44.270 --> 05:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
the exclusive use of pasas in packaging
 
05:07:46.590 --> 05:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
and there are more States than
 
05:07:49.788 --> 05:07:49.798 align:start position:0%
California that ban food packaging when
 
05:07:51.868 --> 05:07:51.878 align:start position:0%
you look at the other definitions in the
 
05:07:51.878 --> 05:07:53.270 align:start position:0%
you look at the other definitions in the
other

05:07:53.270 --> 05:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:07:55.990 --> 05:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
state this bill focuses on the
 
05:07:59.350 --> 05:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
intentional addition of PAs to Consumer
 
05:08:02.708 --> 05:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
products in Communications I have had
 
05:08:05.868 --> 05:08:05.878 align:start position:0%
with industry Representatives we agreed
 
05:08:07.910 --> 05:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
that the current definition of food
 
05:08:10.230 --> 05:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
packaging was acceptable
 
05:08:12.470 --> 05:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
as the focus of this bill is
 
05:08:15.788 --> 05:08:15.798 align:start position:0%
intentionally added

item that has the potential of so much
 
05:08:32.430 --> 05:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
consumption like many bills this
 
05:08:35.270 --> 05:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
legislation has several moving parts and
 
05:08:38.110 --> 05:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
one relies upon the other for complete
 
05:08:41.670 --> 05:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
common sense piece PE uh of of
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%

05:08:47.430 --> 05:08:47.440 align:start position:0%

Speaker if I know that the FDA and other
 
05:10:30.470 --> 05:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
big Regulators are already eliminating P
 
05:10:31.590 --> 05:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
from food
 
05:10:34.070 --> 05:10:34.080 align:start position:0%

05:10:36.390 --> 05:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
California is attempting to regulate ink
 
05:10:38.230 --> 05:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
on labels and shipping

05:10:42.910 --> 05:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
chance that grocery store shelves will
 
05:10:45.868 --> 05:10:45.878 align:start position:0%
be bar due to lack of compliant

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
05:11:12.548 --> 05:11:12.558 align:start position:0%
that the FDA um announcement that's
 
05:11:15.548 --> 05:11:15.558 align:start position:0%
being referred to only apply to three
 
05:11:18.190 --> 05:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of food processing and
 
05:11:21.030 --> 05:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
there are others if I know that the
 
05:11:23.590 --> 05:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
definition of p was fully vetted and
 
05:11:25.868 --> 05:11:25.878 align:start position:0%
recommended by the policy committee
 
05:11:28.470 --> 05:11:28.480 align:start position:0%

supported by the finance
 
05:11:33.270 --> 05:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
committee if I know changing a
 
05:11:35.310 --> 05:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
foundational definition here on the
 
05:11:37.750 --> 05:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
floor without vetting whatsoever or
 
05:11:39.708 --> 05:11:39.718 align:start position:0%
public input is ill advised ized and
 
05:11:42.470 --> 05:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
unwise and is less protective to the

05:11:47.708 --> 05:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
health um and wait I'm on the I need to
 
05:11:51.270 --> 05:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
find my other page okay if I know that
 
05:11:54.030 --> 05:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
some food packaging can contain unwanted
 
05:11:57.470 --> 05:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
p and by amending this definition P
 
05:11:59.788 --> 05:11:59.798 align:start position:0%
added ban would only apply to Paper
 
05:12:01.830 --> 05:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
Products excluding those products
 
05:12:05.350 --> 05:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
exposing us to more of these hazardous
 
05:12:07.628 --> 05:12:07.638 align:start position:0%
chemicals and if I know that the point
 
05:12:09.868 --> 05:12:09.878 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to protect the public
 
05:12:12.510 --> 05:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
health and stem the tide of pasas in our
 
05:12:15.590 --> 05:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
water air and soils and by changing this
 
05:12:18.270 --> 05:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
definition more pasas added products can
 
05:12:20.708 --> 05:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
accumulate in our landfills only to
 
05:12:23.470 --> 05:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
leech out later would I now press the

okay Mr Speaker I urge this body to
 
05:14:35.788 --> 05:14:35.798 align:start position:0%
reject this floor amendment to change
 
05:14:37.628 --> 05:14:37.638 align:start position:0%
the definition of
 
05:14:42.390 --> 05:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
p this change basically eviscerates the
 
05:14:44.430 --> 05:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
protections of HB
 
05:14:48.110 --> 05:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
1649 by severely limiting the types of P
 
05:14:50.390 --> 05:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
molecules that would be banned for use
 
05:14:53.788 --> 05:14:53.798 align:start position:0%
in our everyday products by making the
 
05:14:57.590 --> 05:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
definition far more limited many fewer P
 
05:15:00.030 --> 05:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
added products will be banned and we
 
05:15:02.670 --> 05:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
will be left not much better off than we
 
05:15:06.788 --> 05:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
are now this definition looks backward
 
05:15:13.270 --> 05:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
not forward PF OS pfna and PF
 
05:15:16.310 --> 05:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
OA are already being used less by
 
05:15:19.190 --> 05:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturers because of their hazards
 
05:15:21.548 --> 05:15:21.558 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean manufacturers have
 
05:15:25.110 --> 05:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
stopped using pasas these versions of
 
05:15:28.350 --> 05:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
pasas are simply replaced with another
 
05:15:32.230 --> 05:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
configuration of pasas and that my
 
05:15:35.150 --> 05:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
colleagues is exactly the problem this
 
05:15:37.830 --> 05:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
is like a game of whack-a-mole to
 
05:15:40.590 --> 05:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
achieve the goal of this legislation we
 
05:15:43.430 --> 05:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
need to look ahead not behind and that
 
05:15:46.548 --> 05:15:46.558 align:start position:0%
takes a prod definition that is now
 
05:15:50.510 --> 05:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
included in this bill we need the broad
 
05:15:53.070 --> 05:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
definition of p to ensure that by
 
05:15:55.948 --> 05:15:55.958 align:start position:0%
changing a hydrogen here or an oxygen
 
05:15:59.150 --> 05:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
there the P created don't fall outside
 
05:15:59.160 --> 05:16:00.070 align:start position:0%
there the P created don't fall outside
the

05:16:00.070 --> 05:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:16:03.548 --> 05:16:03.558 align:start position:0%
definition the focus has to be on the
 
05:16:06.110 --> 05:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
thing that makes these chemicals so
 
05:16:10.390 --> 05:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
dangerous and that is the unbreakable
 
05:16:13.670 --> 05:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
carbon flooring Bond and no matter how
 
05:16:16.430 --> 05:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
you dress it up the health hazards
 
05:16:21.548 --> 05:16:21.558 align:start position:0%
remain like putting lipstick on a past
 
05:16:25.390 --> 05:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
Pig this is precisely the analysis that
 
05:16:28.070 --> 05:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
was done by the house Commerce Committee
 
05:16:31.310 --> 05:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
which looked at this closely because the
 
05:16:34.310 --> 05:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
definition is one of the Cornerstone
 
05:16:36.030 --> 05:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
pieces of this
 
05:16:38.628 --> 05:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
legislation the broader definition now
 
05:16:41.030 --> 05:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
in the bill is what the Commerce
 
05:16:41.040 --> 05:16:42.190 align:start position:0%
in the bill is what the Commerce
Committee

05:16:42.190 --> 05:16:42.200 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
05:16:44.590 --> 05:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
recommended why would we completely
 
05:16:47.708 --> 05:16:47.718 align:start position:0%
ignore their analysis and what is the
 
05:16:51.150 --> 05:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
point of a policy committee working with
 
05:16:55.270 --> 05:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
the chair of Commerce certain items were
 
05:16:58.190 --> 05:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
excluded from the bill while leaving the
 
05:17:01.868 --> 05:17:01.878 align:start position:0%
definition intact and I will say before
 
05:17:04.390 --> 05:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
the final vote the chair asked multiple
 
05:17:06.910 --> 05:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
times if there were other Industry Group
 
05:17:10.270 --> 05:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
that has concerns or needed exclusion
 
05:17:13.390 --> 05:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
the room had many lobbyists not one
 
05:17:16.430 --> 05:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
person responded and I'm told as of
 
05:17:19.270 --> 05:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday no one has reached
 
05:17:22.510 --> 05:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
out it's Folly to change the definition
 
05:17:25.470 --> 05:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
now at this late date here on the floor
 
05:17:28.110 --> 05:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
when this version was never once
 
05:17:31.270 --> 05:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
discussed either in Commerce or in
 
05:17:34.110 --> 05:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
finance in fact another definition of
 
05:17:37.350 --> 05:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
pasas was also rejected that was
 
05:17:40.590 --> 05:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
proposed by my friend from from Epsom it
 
05:17:43.628 --> 05:17:43.638 align:start position:0%
too was rejected as too restrictive and
 
05:17:45.788 --> 05:17:45.798 align:start position:0%
it was actually less restrictive than
 
05:17:48.590 --> 05:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
this one is and not aligned with the
 
05:17:52.110 --> 05:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
policy position adopted by the house not
 
05:17:54.590 --> 05:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
one person requested this during our
 
05:17:58.110 --> 05:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
work sessions or spoke against the bill
 
05:18:00.830 --> 05:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
the harmful health effects are
 
05:18:03.590 --> 05:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
undeniable why have a more restrictive
 
05:18:05.910 --> 05:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
definition when there is really so much
 
05:18:09.670 --> 05:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
at stake even the EPA has now imposed
 
05:18:11.990 --> 05:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
Nationwide drinking water standards for
 
05:18:15.310 --> 05:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
a more expanded list of P than what's
 
05:18:17.190 --> 05:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
being proposed in this
 
05:18:19.830 --> 05:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
amendment the broader definition is
 
05:18:22.270 --> 05:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
protective of the public health it
 
05:18:25.150 --> 05:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
anticipates future changes to the Past
 
05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
molecules by
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and is in fact the
 
05:18:32.230 --> 05:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
standard definition for such bands used
 
05:18:35.190 --> 05:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
in many other states and the Department
 
05:18:38.868 --> 05:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
of Defense it is also the definition of
 
05:18:41.190 --> 05:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
already in our own New Hampshire
 
05:18:45.070 --> 05:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
statutes as part of our existing ban of
 
05:18:48.430 --> 05:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
pasas in firefighting foam we were in
 
05:18:50.868 --> 05:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
the Vanguard adopting that uh
 
05:18:53.190 --> 05:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
Prohibition in
 
05:18:56.470 --> 05:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
2020 manufacturers actually like
 
05:18:58.750 --> 05:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
consistency and they should not have to
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
comply with different different past
 
05:19:04.150 --> 05:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
definitions in different states and
 
05:19:06.948 --> 05:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
certainly not just for our small state
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
then they have to comply with elsewhere
 
05:19:12.030 --> 05:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
Ware such a change would also complic
 
05:19:13.708 --> 05:19:13.718 align:start position:0%
complicate the development of a
 
05:19:16.150 --> 05:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
compliance clearing house and make it
 
05:19:16.160 --> 05:19:18.750 align:start position:0%
compliance clearing house and make it
more

05:19:18.750 --> 05:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:19:22.150 --> 05:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
expensive I urge this body on this basis
 
05:19:25.230 --> 05:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
to reject this unnecessary and unwise
 
05:19:27.590 --> 05:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
floor amendment by pressing the red
 
05:19:31.030 --> 05:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
button and Mr Speaker I again request a
 
05:19:33.628 --> 05:19:33.638 align:start position:0%
roll call
 
05:19:35.788 --> 05:19:35.798 align:start position:0%
vote representative Dan Maguire is
 
05:19:37.628 --> 05:19:37.638 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak for the
 
05:19:37.638 --> 05:19:39.750 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak for the
amendment

05:19:39.750 --> 05:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:19:42.230 --> 05:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I actually agree
 
05:19:43.670 --> 05:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
with part of that but I'll get to it in
 
05:19:46.910 --> 05:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
a minute um this amendment changes the
 
05:19:49.750 --> 05:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
definition of pasas used in the bill
 
05:19:52.390 --> 05:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
which currently in the bill is a class
 
05:19:54.868 --> 05:19:54.878 align:start position:0%
of fluorinated organic chemicals
 
05:19:57.390 --> 05:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
containing at least one fully
 
05:20:00.390 --> 05:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
fluorinated carbon meaning one carbon
 
05:20:03.948 --> 05:20:03.958 align:start position:0%
atom that has one or two flines off of
 
05:20:06.830 --> 05:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
it and it changes it to the somewhat
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
lengthier list that you see in your seat
 
05:20:12.910 --> 05:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
pocket in front of you on on Amendment
 
05:20:15.708 --> 05:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
1468 the problem with the definition
 
05:20:19.110 --> 05:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
used in the bill is that it's this broad
 
05:20:23.030 --> 05:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's huge and it describes some
 
05:20:27.110 --> 05:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
15,000 useful chemical compounds many of
 
05:20:30.030 --> 05:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
which are known not to be
 
05:20:33.788 --> 05:20:33.798 align:start position:0%
harmful for example over a 100
 
05:20:33.798 --> 05:20:35.910 align:start position:0%
harmful for example over a 100
prescription

05:20:35.910 --> 05:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
05:20:39.548 --> 05:20:39.558 align:start position:0%
medications including proac and
 
05:20:43.070 --> 05:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
lipor uh which is now a generic it's off
 
05:20:44.868 --> 05:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
patent called
 
05:20:47.270 --> 05:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
atorvastatin which is the number one
 
05:20:50.070 --> 05:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
prescription drug in the United States
 
05:20:53.470 --> 05:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
with 120 million prescriptions issued
 
05:20:57.990 --> 05:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
per year meets the definition of pasas
 
05:21:00.910 --> 05:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
inhouse Bill
 
05:21:04.708 --> 05:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
1649 now I would argue that medications
 
05:21:07.948 --> 05:21:07.958 align:start position:0%
medications are exempt from 1649 by the
 
05:21:12.430 --> 05:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
way right so the bill does not um ban
 
05:21:15.430 --> 05:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
medications but I would argue that
 
05:21:18.590 --> 05:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
medications are among the most tested
 
05:21:18.600 --> 05:21:19.948 align:start position:0%
medications are among the most tested
and

05:21:19.948 --> 05:21:19.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:21:21.708 --> 05:21:21.718 align:start position:0%
safest uh
 
05:21:24.270 --> 05:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
items in the world right I mean these
 
05:21:26.230 --> 05:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
These are thoroughly
 
05:21:32.110 --> 05:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
tested and uh for safety right and how
 
05:21:34.910 --> 05:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
reliable is the definition we're
 
05:21:40.070 --> 05:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
using if we Define as harmful things a
 
05:21:42.910 --> 05:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
def we use a definition that includes
 
05:21:44.628 --> 05:21:44.638 align:start position:0%
multiple prescription
 
05:21:48.310 --> 05:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
drugs right doesn't make sense similarly
 
05:21:50.948 --> 05:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
here we'll get to Teflon here similarly
 
05:21:53.590 --> 05:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
the definition in the bill includes
 
05:21:56.310 --> 05:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
Teflon which is known as
 
05:22:01.548 --> 05:22:01.558 align:start position:0%
PTFE Teflon is 100% fully fluorinated
 
05:22:04.590 --> 05:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
carbon atoms so the definition in House
 
05:22:04.600 --> 05:22:06.390 align:start position:0%
carbon atoms so the definition in House
Bill

05:22:06.390 --> 05:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:22:11.030 --> 05:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
1649 is is exactly Teflon right so if
 
05:22:14.990 --> 05:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
any compound included one Teflon
 
05:22:18.190 --> 05:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
molecule as part of its you know larger
 
05:22:21.270 --> 05:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
molecule then it then it would be banned
 
05:22:21.280 --> 05:22:22.948 align:start position:0%
molecule then it then it would be banned
okay

05:22:22.948 --> 05:22:22.958 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:22:26.948 --> 05:22:26.958 align:start position:0%
Teflon is widely used in implantable
 
05:22:30.708 --> 05:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
devices like catheters and heart valves
 
05:22:33.628 --> 05:22:33.638 align:start position:0%
and things like that it's what gives
 
05:22:37.110 --> 05:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
Glide dental floss its slippery
 
05:22:39.270 --> 05:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
qualities um
 
05:22:42.948 --> 05:22:42.958 align:start position:0%
gortex uh it gives gortex its waterproof
 
05:22:46.470 --> 05:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
quality and Teflon tape its ability to
 
05:22:48.590 --> 05:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
seal pipe
 
05:22:50.948 --> 05:22:50.958 align:start position:0%
connections we have already you talked
 
05:22:54.390 --> 05:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
about its use in inks right it's also
 
05:22:58.070 --> 05:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
found in wiring insulation and non-stick
 
05:23:00.830 --> 05:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
cookware the shirt tie and shoes I'm
 
05:23:04.110 --> 05:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
wearing today meet the definition of
 
05:23:07.430 --> 05:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
pest in the bill
 
05:23:07.440 --> 05:23:10.190 align:start position:0%
pest in the bill
okay

05:23:10.190 --> 05:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:23:12.590 --> 05:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
strangely none of those things I just
 
05:23:15.310 --> 05:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned including my shirt and so on
 
05:23:17.670 --> 05:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
are regulated by this
 
05:23:21.270 --> 05:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
bill uh but what is banned is any
 
05:23:24.670 --> 05:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
tablecloth drape sheet upholstery carpet
 
05:23:28.548 --> 05:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
or textile treatment that includes
 
05:23:30.990 --> 05:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
Teflon this means that much of what is
 
05:23:32.948 --> 05:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
on the market today that is stain
 
05:23:35.310 --> 05:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
resistant or waterproof in those
 
05:23:40.830 --> 05:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:43.590 --> 05:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
to narrow the definition of pest to
 
05:23:46.070 --> 05:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
actually harmful chemicals I again
 
05:23:48.390 --> 05:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
turned to
 
05:23:51.350 --> 05:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
California for many years California has
 
05:23:55.190 --> 05:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
had a labeling law called Proposition 65
 
05:23:57.548 --> 05:23:57.558 align:start position:0%
you may have seen products labeled for
 
05:24:00.430 --> 05:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
the California Market that say something
 
05:24:04.230 --> 05:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
like uh Proposition 65 warning this
 
05:24:07.708 --> 05:24:07.718 align:start position:0%
product contains some chemical known to
 
05:24:09.948 --> 05:24:09.958 align:start position:0%
the state of California to cause cancer
 
05:24:11.830 --> 05:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
or birth defects or
 
05:24:15.310 --> 05:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
whatever those warnings are on anything
 
05:24:18.670 --> 05:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
that contains any item on a list of
 
05:24:18.680 --> 05:24:20.190 align:start position:0%
that contains any item on a list of
dangerous

05:24:20.190 --> 05:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
05:24:24.590 --> 05:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
chemicals that list is 22 pages long it
 
05:24:27.470 --> 05:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
has hundreds and hundreds of chemicals
 
05:24:27.480 --> 05:24:28.350 align:start position:0%
has hundreds and hundreds of chemicals
on

05:24:28.350 --> 05:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:24:31.430 --> 05:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
it what you see in this amendment in
 
05:24:34.948 --> 05:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
front of you are all the pasas items
 
05:24:37.070 --> 05:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
from that
 
05:24:39.350 --> 05:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
list right
 
05:24:42.390 --> 05:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:24:45.590 --> 05:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
verbatim they include the the two
 
05:24:48.708 --> 05:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
harmful chemicals found in
 
05:24:53.430 --> 05:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
marac right plus a plus another one and
 
05:24:56.350 --> 05:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
all directly related
 
05:24:59.548 --> 05:24:59.558 align:start position:0%
compounds but they do not include Teflon
 
05:25:03.910 --> 05:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
gortex or Lipitor none of which gets a
 
05:25:07.310 --> 05:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:09.868 --> 05:25:09.878 align:start position:0%
California all right the advantage of
 
05:25:12.910 --> 05:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
using this definition besides targeting
 
05:25:15.628 --> 05:25:15.638 align:start position:0%
chemicals that are actually harmful is
 
05:25:18.470 --> 05:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
that producers already know which of
 
05:25:21.110 --> 05:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
their products require a California
 
05:25:23.750 --> 05:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
warning and which
 
05:25:27.030 --> 05:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
don't um if those products are in
 
05:25:30.150 --> 05:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
categories banned by House Bill
 
05:25:33.548 --> 05:25:33.558 align:start position:0%
1649 then they couldn't be sold in in
 
05:25:33.558 --> 05:25:34.390 align:start position:0%
1649 then they couldn't be sold in in
New

05:25:34.390 --> 05:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:25:37.030 --> 05:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but manufacturers would not
 
05:25:40.150 --> 05:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
have to do anything special for
 
05:25:43.150 --> 05:25:43.160 align:start position:0%
us um as they would with the with the
 
05:25:45.628 --> 05:25:45.638 align:start position:0%
definition now in the bill and they
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
would have an easier time uh complying
 
05:25:51.830 --> 05:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:54.590 --> 05:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
regulations but I would like to be
 
05:25:58.708 --> 05:25:58.718 align:start position:0%
clear California has adopted some
 
05:26:02.350 --> 05:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
bans including on cosmetics and toys and
 
05:26:06.350 --> 05:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
a few other things that use the
 
05:26:08.948 --> 05:26:08.958 align:start position:0%
definition that's currently in House
 
05:26:08.958 --> 05:26:10.670 align:start position:0%
definition that's currently in House
Bill

05:26:10.670 --> 05:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:26:15.548 --> 05:26:15.558 align:start position:0%
1649 okay those bans have not yet gone
 
05:26:15.558 --> 05:26:16.910 align:start position:0%
1649 okay those bans have not yet gone
into

05:26:16.910 --> 05:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:26:20.150 --> 05:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
effect right just like House Bill 1649
 
05:26:23.868 --> 05:26:23.878 align:start position:0%
pushes off the effective date so does
 
05:26:26.270 --> 05:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
California and I think that California
 
05:26:29.628 --> 05:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
made a mistake by Banning things that
 
05:26:32.548 --> 05:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
they themselves do not think deserves a
 
05:26:32.558 --> 05:26:34.948 align:start position:0%
they themselves do not think deserves a
health

05:26:34.948 --> 05:26:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:39.430 --> 05:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
warning right the very the very breth of
 
05:26:42.270 --> 05:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
that legislation has caused California's
 
05:26:47.750 --> 05:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
governor Nome to veto some past bills
 
05:26:49.830 --> 05:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
passed by his
 
05:26:51.788 --> 05:26:51.798 align:start position:0%
legislature I don't think that the
 
05:26:54.788 --> 05:26:54.798 align:start position:0%
sponsors of House Bill 1649 would like
 
05:26:58.910 --> 05:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
to have the same fate happen to it
 
05:27:01.190 --> 05:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
please press the green button does a
 
05:27:03.830 --> 05:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
member yield for a question yes I
 
05:27:06.390 --> 05:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative hole you may
 
05:27:08.470 --> 05:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you Mr Speaker I'll make
 
05:27:11.270 --> 05:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
it a quick question if the harm for
 
05:27:14.708 --> 05:27:14.718 align:start position:0%
these chemicals is truly about getting
 
05:27:16.948 --> 05:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
inside the
 
05:27:20.310 --> 05:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
body and the bill talks about packaging
 
05:27:21.430 --> 05:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
but not
 
05:27:25.110 --> 05:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
cookware talks about gortex fabric
 
05:27:28.788 --> 05:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
clothes and carpets but doesn't talk
 
05:27:30.868 --> 05:27:30.878 align:start position:0%
about implantable medical devices are we
 
05:27:35.310 --> 05:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:37.110 --> 05:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for the question

05:27:43.110 --> 05:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:45.910 --> 05:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
no representative eiles recognized speak
 
05:27:50.590 --> 05:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:54.310 --> 05:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
amendment oh you want it ready my bad
 
05:27:56.548 --> 05:27:56.558 align:start position:0%
representative Bill Boyd is recognized
 
05:28:01.230 --> 05:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:03.270 --> 05:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr

Speaker and Mr Speaker through you to my
 
05:28:07.510 --> 05:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleagues of the New Hampshire
 
05:28:09.230 --> 05:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
General Court
 
05:28:10.910 --> 05:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
today I rise in opposition to the
 
05:28:14.590 --> 05:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment 1460 H the amendment
 
05:28:19.030 --> 05:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
removes Gen X and F floex sulfonic acid
 
05:28:21.948 --> 05:28:21.958 align:start position:0%
from the pro proposed Bill eliminating
 
05:28:23.670 --> 05:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
the definition and the remedy the
 
05:28:26.510 --> 05:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
language seeks to establish to protect
 
05:28:28.830 --> 05:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
Granite State
 
05:28:31.470 --> 05:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
groundwater as we all know New
 
05:28:33.708 --> 05:28:33.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's ground water becomes the
 
05:28:36.390 --> 05:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
source water that percolates through our
 
05:28:38.990 --> 05:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
strata into our stream and rivers
 
05:28:42.948 --> 05:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
artisian Wells ponds and lakes they
 
05:28:46.390 --> 05:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
remain our primary sources for drinking
 
05:28:49.350 --> 05:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
water now I chair the New Hampshire
 
05:28:52.070 --> 05:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
drinking water and groundwater advisory
 
05:28:54.750 --> 05:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
commission which was tasked under RSA
 
05:28:58.708 --> 05:28:58.718 align:start position:0%
485 hyphen f colon 3 to investigate
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
manage and remediate contaminated and
 
05:29:04.190 --> 05:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
polluted groundwater while administering
 
05:29:05.628 --> 05:29:05.638 align:start position:0%
a trust fund of
 
05:29:10.350 --> 05:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
$277 million acquired in 2016 from the
 
05:29:13.310 --> 05:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
state's Exon Mobile settlement since
 
05:29:16.030 --> 05:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
then the commission has leveraged over
 
05:29:19.670 --> 05:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
$180 million in Grant and Loans in
 
05:29:21.788 --> 05:29:21.798 align:start position:0%
support of municipalities and Village
 
05:29:24.628 --> 05:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
districts goals of cleaning water and
 
05:29:26.948 --> 05:29:26.958 align:start position:0%
improving water access to its
 
05:29:29.910 --> 05:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
users communities like wendam Salem
 
05:29:33.670 --> 05:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
Jaffrey Peterboro Conway Rochester and
 
05:29:36.948 --> 05:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
Winchester to name a few have benefited
 
05:29:39.310 --> 05:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
from the funding provided ed through the
 
05:29:40.868 --> 05:29:40.878 align:start position:0%
Drinking Water
 
05:29:44.510 --> 05:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
Commission we've allocated $9.5 million
 
05:29:46.548 --> 05:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
in Source water protection to
 
05:29:48.548 --> 05:29:48.558 align:start position:0%
communities like West Morland and
 
05:29:50.948 --> 05:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
Kingston and North umberland we've
 
05:29:54.270 --> 05:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
allocated $5 million for a posos rebate
 
05:29:57.350 --> 05:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
program for private well owners to
 
05:29:59.390 --> 05:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
implement a point of entry treatment
 
05:30:01.830 --> 05:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
system for their homes and it doesn't
 
05:30:04.350 --> 05:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
even begin to scratch the surface of
 
05:30:06.030 --> 05:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
other allocations that came from our
 
05:30:08.708 --> 05:30:08.718 align:start position:0%
general fund in support of existing
 
05:30:11.590 --> 05:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
Statewide water revolving funds ARA
 
05:30:14.110 --> 05:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
money and the recent news of Federal
 
05:30:16.310 --> 05:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
grant money coming to New Hampshire in
 
05:30:18.628 --> 05:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
the amount of $9.7 million to treat
 
05:30:22.150 --> 05:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
Posas and our water the commitment to
 
05:30:24.030 --> 05:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
invest millions of dollars into
 
05:30:26.830 --> 05:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
providing access to clean portable water
 
05:30:29.270 --> 05:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
to all granted stat is
 
05:30:31.708 --> 05:30:31.718 align:start position:0%
evident now I asked the question based
 
05:30:33.830 --> 05:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
on the data that I've
 
05:30:36.310 --> 05:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
presented why are we investing all this
 
05:30:38.750 --> 05:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
money to remediate p and other
 
05:30:40.990 --> 05:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
pollutants in our drinking water but
 
05:30:43.150 --> 05:30:43.160 align:start position:0%
we're allowing these posos forever
 
05:30:45.750 --> 05:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
chemicals to permeate unfettered in our
 
05:30:48.788 --> 05:30:48.798 align:start position:0%
land fills which filter down its way
 
05:30:50.430 --> 05:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
into our
 
05:30:52.830 --> 05:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
groundwater this fi these financial
 
05:30:54.628 --> 05:30:54.638 align:start position:0%
investments that we've been making run
 
05:30:56.470 --> 05:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
contrary to our
 
05:30:58.788 --> 05:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
actions this floor Amendment as
 
05:31:01.350 --> 05:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
presented removes two key chemical
 
05:31:03.430 --> 05:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
compounds from the bill which would
 
05:31:06.070 --> 05:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
curtail any meaningful rule to control
 
05:31:08.510 --> 05:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
these chemicals in our solways from
 
05:31:11.510 --> 05:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
leeching into our groundwater voting
 
05:31:13.150 --> 05:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
against this amendment will permit the
 
05:31:15.868 --> 05:31:15.878 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill to offer a significant
 
05:31:18.190 --> 05:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
first step to tackling products with
 
05:31:20.910 --> 05:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
posos while allowing the state The
 
05:31:23.070 --> 05:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
Village districts and municipalities to
 
05:31:26.510 --> 05:31:26.520 align:start position:0%

gortex and many other safe items and if

list to the known harmful compounds that
 
05:33:47.110 --> 05:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
California warns against that have

inquiry if I know that the definition of
 
05:34:11.310 --> 05:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
pasas was fully vetted and recommended
 
05:34:14.150 --> 05:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
by the policy committee house Commerce
 
05:34:16.110 --> 05:34:16.120 align:start position:0%
passed by this house and supported by
 
05:34:18.948 --> 05:34:18.958 align:start position:0%
the finance committee if I know that
 
05:34:21.430 --> 05:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
changing a foundational definition here
 
05:34:23.990 --> 05:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
on the floor without any vetting
 
05:34:26.830 --> 05:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
whatsoever which was not requested
 
05:34:29.590 --> 05:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
during any hearing and there has been no
 
05:34:32.910 --> 05:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
public ill input is ill-advised and
 
05:34:36.270 --> 05:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
unwise and far less protective of Public
 
05:34:39.270 --> 05:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
Health and if Fino manufacturers are
 
05:34:41.510 --> 05:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
already familiar with and will be
 
05:34:44.948 --> 05:34:44.958 align:start position:0%
following the definition in HB 1649
 
05:34:47.070 --> 05:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
because that's what is used in similar
 
05:34:50.190 --> 05:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
bands across the United States more than
 
05:34:51.310 --> 05:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
in just
 
05:34:54.190 --> 05:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
California and the new definition simply
 
05:34:56.430 --> 05:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
complicates this bill and makes it more
 
05:34:59.990 --> 05:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
expensive for manufacturers and for Dees
 
05:35:02.270 --> 05:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
when it establishes the compliance
 
05:35:05.110 --> 05:35:05.120 align:start position:0%

05:37:32.590 --> 05:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
05:37:37.190 --> 05:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
if I know that laws and regulations like
 
05:37:37.200 --> 05:37:38.310 align:start position:0%
if I know that laws and regulations like
this

05:37:38.310 --> 05:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:37:41.190 --> 05:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
are really the purview of the federal
 
05:37:43.910 --> 05:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
government and are better handled by the
 
05:37:48.230 --> 05:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
federal EPA to give us National
 
05:37:53.110 --> 05:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
uniformity in rules for consistency to
 
05:37:55.910 --> 05:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
businesses as other speakers have
 
05:37:58.310 --> 05:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
actually called for
 
05:38:01.830 --> 05:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
earlier if I know that legislation that
 
05:38:06.030 --> 05:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
goes to ban substances should be banning
 
05:38:09.390 --> 05:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
substances that are
 
05:38:12.030 --> 05:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
bioaccumulative or
 
05:38:17.070 --> 05:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
toxic or bioaccumulative and toxic but
 
05:38:20.350 --> 05:38:20.360 align:start position:0%
not entire classes of compounds that
 
05:38:25.270 --> 05:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:28.830 --> 05:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
thousands and Mr Speaker if I
 
05:38:32.510 --> 05:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
know that industry in the United States
 
05:38:36.830 --> 05:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
today is already working diligently
 
05:38:40.868 --> 05:38:40.878 align:start position:0%
towards past free products because the
 
05:38:44.390 --> 05:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
state of Maine two years ago passed the
 
05:38:49.750 --> 05:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
most restrictive P law in the nation and
 
05:38:52.310 --> 05:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
so to be able to produce and sell a
 
05:38:54.990 --> 05:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
product in all 50 states you would have
 
05:38:57.468 --> 05:38:57.478 align:start position:0%
to adhere to the main
 
05:39:00.070 --> 05:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
regulations so if I know that that would
 
05:39:03.590 --> 05:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
make this bill redundant and make it
 
05:39:06.868 --> 05:39:06.878 align:start position:0%
more complicated for businesses involved
 
05:39:09.430 --> 05:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
in inter State Commerce would I now
 
05:39:12.270 --> 05:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
press the green button to table this
 
05:39:14.990 --> 05:39:15.000 align:start position:0%

05:39:18.230 --> 05:39:18.240 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
05:39:30.750 --> 05:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that there is intense
 
05:39:33.708 --> 05:39:33.718 align:start position:0%
concern and interest in the state of New
 
05:39:38.310 --> 05:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in existing P contamination
 
05:39:40.708 --> 05:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
especially in marac where they've had
 
05:39:43.390 --> 05:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
the biggest environmental disaster in
 
05:39:46.868 --> 05:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire because of
 
05:39:50.830 --> 05:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
contamination if I know that New
 
05:39:54.030 --> 05:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't only regulate the way
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
other states do New Hampshire takes
 
05:40:00.230 --> 05:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
actions that make sense to
 
05:40:05.390 --> 05:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
it if I know that even though we've been
 
05:40:08.150 --> 05:40:08.160 align:start position:0%

05:40:19.430 --> 05:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
important bills um I would say that
 
05:40:21.750 --> 05:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about today considering
 
05:40:24.868 --> 05:40:24.878 align:start position:0%

I worked a good portion of that time in
 
05:43:20.030 --> 05:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
the super fund program which you know
 
05:43:22.110 --> 05:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
super fund sites are the most highly
 
05:43:23.990 --> 05:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
contaminated sites in the
 
05:43:26.270 --> 05:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
country I have been on those sites I've
 
05:43:28.868 --> 05:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
taken thousands of contaminated
 
05:43:31.788 --> 05:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
groundwater and surface water and soil
 
05:43:33.990 --> 05:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
samples I've spent a considerable amount
 
05:43:36.150 --> 05:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
of time at the dairy landfill the old
 
05:43:37.910 --> 05:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
dairy landfill
 
05:43:40.430 --> 05:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
deciding uh for EPA whether that should
 
05:43:42.670 --> 05:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
be on the super fund list turns out that
 
05:43:44.390 --> 05:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
it was
 
05:43:47.708 --> 05:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
not um I've performed site assessments
 
05:43:49.390 --> 05:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
for a number of other sites to see if
 
05:43:51.150 --> 05:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
they would qualify for the super fund
 
05:43:54.910 --> 05:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
list I've also managed the remediation
 
05:43:57.030 --> 05:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
of several hazardous was
 
05:44:00.750 --> 05:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
sites and oil and gas contaminated sites
 
05:44:02.548 --> 05:44:02.558 align:start position:0%
so I think I maybe have a little bit
 
05:44:05.468 --> 05:44:05.478 align:start position:0%
more perspective to give this to give to
 
05:44:08.190 --> 05:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
you for this
 
05:44:11.070 --> 05:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm in opposition to this bill uh
 
05:44:12.510 --> 05:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
primly because of some of the reasons
 
05:44:14.270 --> 05:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
you've already heard that it's very
 
05:44:17.270 --> 05:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
Broad and it takes an entire class of
 
05:44:21.150 --> 05:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
compounds and lumps them into the same
 
05:44:23.830 --> 05:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
category of Health
 
05:44:26.150 --> 05:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
dangers let me give you an
 
05:44:29.670 --> 05:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
example we have dangerous chemicals
 
05:44:31.110 --> 05:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
around us every
 
05:44:35.670 --> 05:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
day Benzene is a human
 
05:44:38.788 --> 05:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
carcinogen and it's acutely toxic and
 
05:44:41.510 --> 05:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
can cause death in the correct amounts
 
05:44:44.110 --> 05:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
if you breathe it in but where is
 
05:44:47.670 --> 05:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
Benzene it's in gasoline every one of
 
05:44:51.110 --> 05:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
you is exposed to Benzene Vapors every
 
05:44:53.110 --> 05:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
time you go to the gas station and fill
 
05:44:53.120 --> 05:44:53.788 align:start position:0%
time you go to the gas station and fill
your

05:44:53.788 --> 05:44:53.798 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:44:56.548 --> 05:44:56.558 align:start position:0%
tank why does that not hurt
 
05:44:59.628 --> 05:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
you because it's about dose it's about
 
05:45:03.868 --> 05:45:03.878 align:start position:0%
how much of that have you taken in all
 
05:45:03.878 --> 05:45:05.190 align:start position:0%
how much of that have you taken in all
of

05:45:05.190 --> 05:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:45:08.910 --> 05:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
these MCL maximum contaminant levels or
 
05:45:10.548 --> 05:45:10.558 align:start position:0%
water quality standard levels whatever
 
05:45:12.788 --> 05:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
you'd like to call them every kind of a
 
05:45:16.310 --> 05:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
standard for health is based on a dosage
 
05:45:18.070 --> 05:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
what is that going to do to you how much
 
05:45:21.190 --> 05:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
do you have of that have you breathed it
 
05:45:24.910 --> 05:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
in or eaten it or or had to drink of
 
05:45:27.628 --> 05:45:27.638 align:start position:0%
that every standard is based on some
 
05:45:30.310 --> 05:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:32.150 --> 05:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
consumption as you've heard already
 
05:45:34.670 --> 05:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
today yesterday EPA came out with their
 
05:45:37.788 --> 05:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
uh drinking water standards for the five
 
05:45:41.750 --> 05:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
past uh constituents the same and Dees
 
05:45:44.670 --> 05:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
already has it for those same uh four of
 
05:45:47.590 --> 05:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
those same five those numbers are based
 
05:45:50.468 --> 05:45:50.478 align:start position:0%
on the person drinking a certain amount
 
05:45:53.468 --> 05:45:53.478 align:start position:0%
of that water over a certain amount of
 
05:45:55.788 --> 05:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
time so it does not mean that if you're
 
05:45:59.150 --> 05:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
exposed to that 10 parts per trillion
 
05:46:01.750 --> 05:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
whatever the number may be whichever
 
05:46:04.350 --> 05:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
whichever of those chemicals it is it
 
05:46:06.310 --> 05:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
does not mean that you're going to get
 
05:46:08.750 --> 05:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
ill IM immediately it doesn't even mean
 
05:46:12.110 --> 05:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
that chronically you might be
 
05:46:15.110 --> 05:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
contracting cancer at a later time
 
05:46:18.230 --> 05:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's up to you to be very specifically
 
05:46:19.510 --> 05:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
understanding of what these standards
 
05:46:22.070 --> 05:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
mean so if you take an entire class of
 
05:46:24.350 --> 05:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
chemicals and say we're going to say
 
05:46:27.310 --> 05:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
they're all dangerous because we know
 
05:46:27.320 --> 05:46:28.708 align:start position:0%
they're all dangerous because we know
these

05:46:28.708 --> 05:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:46:31.310 --> 05:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
five are fairly
 
05:46:33.230 --> 05:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
dangerous that's the argument you've
 
05:46:35.830 --> 05:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
heard that I think that that's a overly
 
05:46:35.840 --> 05:46:37.788 align:start position:0%
heard that I think that that's a overly
Broad

05:46:37.788 --> 05:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
Broad
 
05:46:44.510 --> 05:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:46.750 --> 05:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
it I'm just checking to see if I've
 
05:46:48.468 --> 05:46:48.478 align:start position:0%
covered everything I've written um I
 
05:46:50.868 --> 05:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
want to talk to you a little bit about
 
05:46:52.910 --> 05:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
how does this get into our
 
05:46:55.070 --> 05:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
environment I've heard in the last year
 
05:46:57.030 --> 05:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
and a half that I've been here a number
 
05:47:00.030 --> 05:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
of times and it's been said at least
 
05:47:00.040 --> 05:47:01.070 align:start position:0%
of times and it's been said at least
twice

05:47:01.070 --> 05:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
twice
 
05:47:01.080 --> 05:47:04.628 align:start position:0%
twice
today

05:47:04.628 --> 05:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:09.310 --> 05:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
if that past if we have it in our state
 
05:47:11.310 --> 05:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
it is going to go into a landfill and it
 
05:47:13.548 --> 05:47:13.558 align:start position:0%
is going to go into the drinking water
 
05:47:13.558 --> 05:47:14.350 align:start position:0%
is going to go into the drinking water
through

05:47:14.350 --> 05:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:47:17.190 --> 05:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
lee8 and even if you however you vote on
 
05:47:19.830 --> 05:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
this you remember this now if you would
 
05:47:23.070 --> 05:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
for the future that's not
 
05:47:26.430 --> 05:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
true we have six Active Municipal Solid
 
05:47:28.510 --> 05:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
Waste landfills in New
 
05:47:31.788 --> 05:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all of them are double lined
 
05:47:33.150 --> 05:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
what that
 
05:47:36.230 --> 05:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
means you've got the waste and you have
 
05:47:38.590 --> 05:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
a very thick plastic liner on top of
 
05:47:41.350 --> 05:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
that is a drainage system that collects
 
05:47:43.510 --> 05:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
the leachate the
 
05:47:46.110 --> 05:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
intent is that that leade does not get
 
05:47:49.070 --> 05:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
to the plastic liner and even get down
 
05:47:50.910 --> 05:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
to the groundwater through the
 
05:47:54.070 --> 05:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
liner the lee8 is purposefully collected
 
05:47:56.510 --> 05:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
so it we don't just let the liquids
 
05:47:59.390 --> 05:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
build up in a landfill it's collected
 
05:48:01.310 --> 05:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
and sent off site for
 
05:48:03.310 --> 05:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
treatment depending where the landfill
 
05:48:05.430 --> 05:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
is depends where it goes some of our
 
05:48:07.150 --> 05:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
Municipal wastewater treatment plants
 
05:48:08.310 --> 05:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
can take
 
05:48:10.670 --> 05:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
leate because they have industrial
 
05:48:13.190 --> 05:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
pre-treatment programs that know how to
 
05:48:17.110 --> 05:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
manage that and as time moves on the EPA
 
05:48:20.230 --> 05:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
is adjusting those discharge permits uh
 
05:48:22.590 --> 05:48:22.600 align:start position:0%
to give them past
 
05:48:25.030 --> 05:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
limits some of that leech a is sent off
 
05:48:27.750 --> 05:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
State some is sent to New Jersey so all
 
05:48:31.788 --> 05:48:31.798 align:start position:0%
of the lee8 in your landfills is being
 
05:48:35.788 --> 05:48:35.798 align:start position:0%
collected let's say for sake of argument
 
05:48:38.030 --> 05:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
that that first liner gets a hole in
 
05:48:40.510 --> 05:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
it underneath that first liner is
 
05:48:42.150 --> 05:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
another drainage
 
05:48:46.150 --> 05:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
system that can detect flow
 
05:48:48.670 --> 05:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
rates through the drainage system so
 
05:48:50.030 --> 05:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
they can say oh look there's a lot of
 
05:48:52.390 --> 05:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
flow over here in this drainage system
 
05:48:54.468 --> 05:48:54.478 align:start position:0%
that could mean there's a leak up there
 
05:48:56.628 --> 05:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
and then it can be excavated and
 
05:48:56.638 --> 05:48:58.150 align:start position:0%
and then it can be excavated and
repaired

05:48:58.150 --> 05:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
repaired
 
05:49:01.468 --> 05:49:01.478 align:start position:0%
so remember this no matter how many
 
05:49:03.390 --> 05:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
times someone in here says if you put
 
05:49:05.270 --> 05:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
something in a landfill it's going into
 
05:49:07.590 --> 05:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
the groundwater or surface water water
 
05:49:11.110 --> 05:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
that just is not accurate please uh do
 
05:49:14.070 --> 05:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
your homework on that if if you uh if
 
05:49:15.548 --> 05:49:15.558 align:start position:0%
you uh if you don't agree with that you
 
05:49:17.150 --> 05:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
know do your own
 
05:49:17.160 --> 05:49:21.070 align:start position:0%
know do your own
homework

05:49:21.070 --> 05:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:23.990 --> 05:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
um so kind of
 
05:49:26.310 --> 05:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
summarize the best way I think to reduce
 
05:49:27.670 --> 05:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
exposure to
 
05:49:30.070 --> 05:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
pasas let me back up a little bit I I
 
05:49:32.670 --> 05:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
will I'll reiterate what I said earlier
 
05:49:35.868 --> 05:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
this is very broad it's a broad bill it
 
05:49:37.310 --> 05:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
it includes
 
05:49:40.590 --> 05:49:40.600 align:start position:0%
everything every C Every chemical in the
 
05:49:40.600 --> 05:49:42.230 align:start position:0%
everything every C Every chemical in the
pest

05:49:42.230 --> 05:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
pest
 
05:49:45.548 --> 05:49:45.558 align:start position:0%
universe and EPA and Dees have only come
 
05:49:50.350 --> 05:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
up with levels for four or five of those
 
05:49:51.990 --> 05:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
and that's only if you drink it that's
 
05:49:53.868 --> 05:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
not if you touch it that's not if you
 
05:49:56.548 --> 05:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
have it on a cup on some ink that's only
 
05:49:58.910 --> 05:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
if you consume the
 
05:50:01.830 --> 05:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
water so the best way to continue this I
 
05:50:03.190 --> 05:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
think for the State of New Hampshire is
 
05:50:05.590 --> 05:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
what FDA has already initiated as you've
 
05:50:07.590 --> 05:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
heard elimin ating some of this from
 
05:50:10.070 --> 05:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
food packaging but that happened in
 
05:50:12.830 --> 05:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
February after the already did
 
05:50:15.548 --> 05:50:15.558 align:start position:0%
that continue to properly collect and
 
05:50:18.270 --> 05:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
treat Landfield
 
05:50:21.070 --> 05:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
leachate and therefore that would
 
05:50:24.230 --> 05:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
continue to eliminate past sources to
 
05:50:24.240 --> 05:50:31.070 align:start position:0%
continue to eliminate past sources to
drinking

05:50:31.070 --> 05:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:33.270 --> 05:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
water therefore I would ask you to
 
05:50:37.670 --> 05:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
please press the red button thank you
 
05:50:38.830 --> 05:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
representative danan Maguire's
 
05:50:44.190 --> 05:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:47.590 --> 05:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker when
 
05:50:51.030 --> 05:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
California's governor governor Nome
 
05:50:54.430 --> 05:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
vetoed the uh menstrual products ban
 
05:50:57.830 --> 05:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill the same provision is in house bill

it the sheer number of products involved

means that enforcement is necessarily

any particular technology to

for that of millions of

inform people of the hazards if hazards
 
05:53:52.030 --> 05:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
exist and let them make their own

I'm back thank you Mr Speaker um I rise
 
05:54:14.788 --> 05:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
today in support of HB
 
05:54:17.830 --> 05:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
1649 an important bipartisan bill that
 
05:54:20.110 --> 05:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
would ban the sale of consumer products
 
05:54:22.468 --> 05:54:22.478 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that we use in our
 
05:54:25.270 --> 05:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
everyday lives with past that have been
 
05:54:27.190 --> 05:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
intentionally added by
 
05:54:29.948 --> 05:54:29.958 align:start position:0%
manufacturers for forever chemicals are
 
05:54:32.670 --> 05:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
made to never break down and they don't
 
05:54:36.628 --> 05:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
creating havoc in their wake I urge this
 
05:54:38.910 --> 05:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
body to support the finance committee's
 
05:54:41.190 --> 05:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
bipartisan ought to pass as amended
 
05:54:43.990 --> 05:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this bill and as has
 
05:54:46.788 --> 05:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
been mentioned many times this follows
 
05:54:48.708 --> 05:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
The house's strong Voice vote and
 
05:54:51.910 --> 05:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
support and the Commerce Committee um
 
05:54:51.920 --> 05:54:52.788 align:start position:0%
support and the Commerce Committee um
strong

05:54:52.788 --> 05:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
strong
 
05:54:55.350 --> 05:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation we need to stop P
 
05:54:58.310 --> 05:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
contamination in its tracks just
 
05:55:00.750 --> 05:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday the EPA finally took action
 
05:55:02.830 --> 05:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
requiring drinking water utilities
 
05:55:05.310 --> 05:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
across the country to remove remove
 
05:55:08.548 --> 05:55:08.558 align:start position:0%

per
 
05:55:12.548 --> 05:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
trillion this is yet another huge wakeup
 
05:55:14.948 --> 05:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
call on the extreme hazards of the
 
05:55:17.468 --> 05:55:17.478 align:start position:0%
chemicals regardless of your personal
 
05:55:19.430 --> 05:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
opinions of the health
 
05:55:21.868 --> 05:55:21.878 align:start position:0%
effects these regulations must be
 
05:55:25.230 --> 05:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
complied with and at huge expense and as
 
05:55:27.670 --> 05:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
we spend unbelievable amounts of money
 
05:55:30.990 --> 05:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
to remove P one wonders why the heck do
 
05:55:34.070 --> 05:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
we keep using the stuff for so many
 
05:55:36.750 --> 05:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
consumer products when it is a
 
05:55:39.350 --> 05:55:39.360 align:start position:0%

05:55:42.750 --> 05:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
stop surface water groundwater private

these health problems can result from

even in the breast milk of new mothers
 
05:56:13.590 --> 05:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
it's been found and their newborns and
 
05:56:15.910 --> 05:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's time to stop our
 
05:56:18.350 --> 05:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
exposure is there another state that's
 
05:56:20.750 --> 05:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
been quite as burdened by past
 
05:56:23.110 --> 05:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
contamination our attorney general has
 
05:56:25.948 --> 05:56:25.958 align:start position:0%
sued for millions and damages and we've
 
05:56:29.030 --> 05:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
already spent about $110 million dollars
 
05:56:32.708 --> 05:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
in tax tax dollars to mitigate past
 
05:56:35.468 --> 05:56:35.478 align:start position:0%
contamination and there's no end in
 
05:56:39.350 --> 05:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
sight so what to do it's time to focus
 
05:56:42.830 --> 05:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
on the source of pasas in all our lives
 
05:56:44.670 --> 05:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
these forever chemicals are in a
 
05:56:47.750 --> 05:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
mindboggling number of consumer products
 
05:56:50.510 --> 05:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
ensuring baby mattresses don't stain
 
05:56:52.788 --> 05:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
food doesn't stick and we don't get
 
05:56:55.708 --> 05:56:55.718 align:start position:0%
spaghetti stains on our easy chairs but
 
05:56:59.310 --> 05:56:59.320 align:start position:0%
at what cost this bill seeks to stem the
 
05:57:02.548 --> 05:57:02.558 align:start position:0%
tide of past in our lives and it brought
 
05:57:05.750 --> 05:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
together a remarkable unusual group of
 
05:57:08.750 --> 05:57:08.760 align:start position:0%

together such disperate groups together

Stop in three years man manufacturers
 
05:57:38.948 --> 05:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
would be banned from selling specified

products in our state to which they've
 
05:57:43.868 --> 05:57:43.878 align:start position:0%
added pasas and for the most part these
 
05:57:45.788 --> 05:57:45.798 align:start position:0%
are products that are most commonly
 
05:57:48.910 --> 05:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
banned in other states and more States
 
05:57:51.868 --> 05:57:51.878 align:start position:0%
will soon join those States we should be

one of them the consumer products
 
05:57:56.910 --> 05:57:56.920 align:start position:0%

either sources of the most direct

that goes right back into the

landfills but much goes into surface and
 
05:58:55.350 --> 05:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
groundw that same water is subsequently
 
05:58:57.830 --> 05:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
used for drinking water where it has to
 
05:59:00.430 --> 05:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
be filtered at extreme costs by our
 
05:59:03.510 --> 05:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
drinking water utilities to ensure our

05:59:11.708 --> 05:59:11.718 align:start position:0%
treat water for past before releasing it
 
05:59:14.788 --> 05:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
something they don't do now our economic
 
05:59:18.430 --> 05:59:18.440 align:start position:0%
burden will be even more enormous and
 
05:59:21.350 --> 05:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
meanwhile manufacturers continue to use
 
05:59:24.548 --> 05:59:24.558 align:start position:0%
past in the products that they sell to
 
05:59:27.868 --> 05:59:27.878 align:start position:0%
us that is the definition of
 
05:59:30.468 --> 05:59:30.478 align:start position:0%
insanity the costs of this bill are
 
05:59:34.310 --> 05:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
minimal one Dees position and
 
05:59:36.708 --> 05:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
$250,000 to get the progam program up
 
05:59:40.190 --> 05:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
and running the reason that Governor
 
05:59:43.628 --> 05:59:43.638 align:start position:0%
Nome vetoed the bills member can suspend
 
05:59:45.510 --> 05:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
for a
 
05:59:48.788 --> 05:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
second why can't we be silent and listen
 
05:59:51.390 --> 05:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
to people speak there are plenty of
 
05:59:54.110 --> 05:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
other places to be if that's impossible
 
05:59:57.390 --> 05:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
for you let's just get through this
 
05:59:59.990 --> 06:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
please continue thank you the reason
 
06:00:02.190 --> 06:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
that the governor vetoed three bills
 
06:00:04.350 --> 06:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
that instituted bans one of which
 
06:00:07.628 --> 06:00:07.638 align:start position:0%
included uh feminine hygiene products is
 
06:00:10.390 --> 06:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
because the way they passed the bills in
 
06:00:13.990 --> 06:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
California there was no uh oversight of
 
06:00:17.350 --> 06:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
a um agency there was simply a ban put
 
06:00:19.510 --> 06:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
in place with a penalty That was
 
06:00:21.590 --> 06:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to be enforced by the Attorney
 
06:00:24.310 --> 06:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
General um and that was his primary
 
06:00:26.510 --> 06:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
concern and that was what the issue was
 
06:00:26.520 --> 06:00:27.750 align:start position:0%
concern and that was what the issue was
in

06:00:27.750 --> 06:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:00:31.548 --> 06:00:31.558 align:start position:0%
California for the um the health impacts
 
06:00:33.830 --> 06:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
and costs of past remediation and
 
06:00:36.590 --> 06:00:36.600 align:start position:0%

06:00:57.110 --> 06:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
very long time this was a particular uh
 
06:00:59.350 --> 06:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
interest of the Commerce Committee when
 
06:01:02.190 --> 06:01:02.200 align:start position:0%
reviewing this bill manufacturers know
 
06:01:04.230 --> 06:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
how to use these CU we've already banned
 
06:01:06.670 --> 06:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
these toxins that's how how these bands
 
06:01:08.708 --> 06:01:08.718 align:start position:0%
are enforced and it's familiar to
 
06:01:11.910 --> 06:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
business once thought of as useful these
 
06:01:14.670 --> 06:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
chemicals like pasas are now recognized
 
06:01:18.830 --> 06:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
as harmful not unlike DDT or mtbe
 
06:01:22.150 --> 06:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
usefulness doesn't equate to safety now
 
06:01:24.788 --> 06:01:24.798 align:start position:0%
it's time to take a strong stand these
 
06:01:27.030 --> 06:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
forever chemicals should not be in the
 
06:01:29.548 --> 06:01:29.558 align:start position:0%
air we breathe the water we drink or the
 
06:01:32.948 --> 06:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
soil we walk on we may never be able to
 
06:01:35.510 --> 06:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
cor correct the damage P has already
 
06:01:35.520 --> 06:01:36.510 align:start position:0%
cor correct the damage P has already
done

06:01:36.510 --> 06:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
done
 
06:01:38.548 --> 06:01:38.558 align:start position:0%
but now is the time to look to the
 
06:01:41.350 --> 06:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
Future and stop using pasas and common
 
06:01:44.468 --> 06:01:44.478 align:start position:0%

inquir thank you for the final time Mr
 
06:04:23.830 --> 06:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that P is a subject of
 
06:04:26.110 --> 06:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
intense interest to Federal Regulators
 
06:04:29.030 --> 06:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
who have significantly more resources
 
06:04:32.430 --> 06:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
than RDS does if I know that California
 
06:04:35.070 --> 06:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
is finding implementing of these bans so
 
06:04:37.350 --> 06:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
challenging their governor has vetoed
 
06:04:39.070 --> 06:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
three such bills because they're
 
06:04:40.230 --> 06:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
06:04:42.708 --> 06:04:42.718 align:start position:0%
enforce and if I know that the leech aid
 
06:04:42.718 --> 06:04:43.510 align:start position:0%
enforce and if I know that the leech aid
from

06:04:43.510 --> 06:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:04:46.830 --> 06:04:46.840 align:start position:0%

06:04:55.110 --> 06:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
caused by Industrial Waste not consumer
 
06:04:57.350 --> 06:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
products and if I know that industrial
 
06:04:59.670 --> 06:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
operators are the primary source of p in
 
06:05:01.670 --> 06:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
the environment not the consumer goods
 
06:05:05.390 --> 06:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
baned in this bill and if I know that
 
06:05:07.670 --> 06:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
we're about to ban and this list is long
 
06:05:09.150 --> 06:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
so if I know we're about to ban this
 
06:05:12.350 --> 06:05:12.360 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker members if
 
06:05:55.390 --> 06:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
I know that our state continues to
 
06:05:58.750 --> 06:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
suffer environmentally and physically
 
06:06:01.948 --> 06:06:01.958 align:start position:0%
from the devastating effects of p in our
 
06:06:06.430 --> 06:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
water air soil and if I know that as a
 
06:06:09.990 --> 06:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
result of millions of dollars spent and
 
06:06:13.628 --> 06:06:13.638 align:start position:0%
hundreds upon hundreds of hours in
 
06:06:18.390 --> 06:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
meetings discussions research litigation
 
06:06:21.670 --> 06:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
negotiations that there is agreement
 
06:06:26.590 --> 06:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
that only one action will further the
 
06:06:30.788 --> 06:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
harm will limit further harm and lastly
 
06:06:34.948 --> 06:06:34.958 align:start position:0%
if I know that that one action to limit
 
06:06:40.390 --> 06:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
further harm is to prohibit p in certain
 
06:06:43.628 --> 06:06:43.638 align:start position:0%
products as this bill
 
06:06:47.628 --> 06:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
does then would I join the bipartisan

for children and supports families
 
06:13:34.110 --> 06:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
struggling to make ends meet and if I
 
06:13:35.628 --> 06:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
know that half of the children in New

06:13:44.510 --> 06:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1212 includes a number of
 
06:13:46.670 --> 06:13:46.680 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
06:14:26.990 --> 06:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
that the finance committee carefully
 
06:14:29.310 --> 06:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
computed how much could be spent from
 
06:14:32.390 --> 06:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
all these bills and this one was not in
 
06:14:34.990 --> 06:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
that computation and if I know it is 50
 
06:14:38.190 --> 06:14:38.200 align:start position:0%
$50 million extra that should not be
 
06:14:40.390 --> 06:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
spent but it will imperil all the other
 
06:14:43.628 --> 06:14:43.638 align:start position:0%

I'm here to speak in support of
 
06:17:52.628 --> 06:17:52.638 align:start position:0%
amendment 1327 H to House Bill 1656
 
06:17:56.190 --> 06:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
found on page 53 simple reason is we
 
06:17:58.310 --> 06:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
need it because it sets the special
 
06:18:00.948 --> 06:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
education grant to public schools to the
 
06:18:03.708 --> 06:18:03.718 align:start position:0%
amount recommended by the bipartisan
 
06:18:06.190 --> 06:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
school funding sub committee and by the
 
06:18:09.510 --> 06:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
education committee the committee report
 
06:18:12.510 --> 06:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
printed in House calendar 7 on house for
 
06:18:16.510 --> 06:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1656 stated in a quote The
 
06:18:18.430 --> 06:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
increased cost for implementing this
 
06:18:20.910 --> 06:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
more appropriate funding mechanism is
 
06:18:23.468 --> 06:18:23.478 align:start position:0%
projected to increase differentiated Aid
 
06:18:27.230 --> 06:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
by $35 million it's the end of the quote
 
06:18:29.230 --> 06:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
and on February
 
06:18:33.868 --> 06:18:33.878 align:start position:0%
22nd this body approved House Bill 1656
 
06:18:36.230 --> 06:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
at this level by a Voice
 
06:18:39.468 --> 06:18:39.478 align:start position:0%
vote but when the bill got to finance
 
06:18:42.110 --> 06:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note was cut in half and
 
06:18:44.190 --> 06:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
that's not what the special subcommittee
 
06:18:46.310 --> 06:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
recommended or what the education
 
06:18:48.910 --> 06:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
committee recommended or what the Full
 
06:18:48.920 --> 06:18:49.750 align:start position:0%
committee recommended or what the Full
House

06:18:49.750 --> 06:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
House
 
06:18:52.030 --> 06:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
approved the bill without this amendment
 
06:18:54.788 --> 06:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't do much to support all public
 
06:18:58.070 --> 06:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
schools so the legisl legislative budget
 
06:19:01.030 --> 06:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
assistant office drafted this amendment
 
06:19:04.270 --> 06:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
to fix it so let's vote Yes on this
 
06:19:07.350 --> 06:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
amendment a yes vote is good for kids
 
06:19:09.430 --> 06:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
good for schools and good for local
 
06:19:09.440 --> 06:19:10.910 align:start position:0%
good for schools and good for local
property

06:19:10.910 --> 06:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
property
 
06:19:13.430 --> 06:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers thank you Mr Speaker and I do
 
06:19:19.190 --> 06:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:24.750 --> 06:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:26.868 --> 06:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
Emer thank you Mr
 
06:19:29.750 --> 06:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker this is a very strange
 
06:19:33.468 --> 06:19:33.478 align:start position:0%
additional Amendment because uh there's
 
06:19:37.110 --> 06:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of unknowns in this particular
 
06:19:40.230 --> 06:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
Bill we don't know we we do know that
 
06:19:42.670 --> 06:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
the state has approximately
 
06:19:45.708 --> 06:19:45.718 align:start position:0%
31,000 special education students that's
 
06:19:49.390 --> 06:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
out of 155,000 so it's about 20% of
 
06:19:52.750 --> 06:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
students require special ed what the
 
06:19:56.270 --> 06:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
primary focus of this bill was is to
 
06:19:58.030 --> 06:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
change what we're currently doing was we
 
06:20:00.830 --> 06:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
changed anybody with a a special ed
 
06:20:03.910 --> 06:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
identity gets the same funding what this
 
06:20:07.708 --> 06:20:07.718 align:start position:0%
B Bill does establish a b and c funding
 
06:20:11.310 --> 06:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
based on hours of need of particular
 
06:20:14.230 --> 06:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
students a very good idea we all agree
 
06:20:16.788 --> 06:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
on it what we don't agree on is how much
 
06:20:19.510 --> 06:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend right now the
 
06:20:22.030 --> 06:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
reason for that is the Department of

Education has absolutely no idea how
 
06:20:28.590 --> 06:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
many a BS and C's rated students there
 
06:20:31.270 --> 06:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
are so the concept of we got to spend
 
06:20:33.590 --> 06:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
more for something we don't know about
 
06:20:35.310 --> 06:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
rather than less
 
06:20:37.430 --> 06:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a lot of sense so I I'm
 
06:20:40.510 --> 06:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to this my Amendment which you
 
06:20:42.868 --> 06:20:42.878 align:start position:0%
voted on which was also prepared by the
 
06:20:46.430 --> 06:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
LBA was for approximately $17
 
06:20:48.510 --> 06:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
million this amendment is for
 
06:20:50.350 --> 06:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
approximately $35
 
06:20:52.788 --> 06:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
million so what we're really voting on
 
06:20:55.070 --> 06:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
is how much do we want to spend on this
 
06:20:58.030 --> 06:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
particular bill as it's trying to be
 
06:21:00.590 --> 06:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
implemented that's what this de is about
 
06:21:01.990 --> 06:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
I hope we you go with the original
 
06:21:03.948 --> 06:21:03.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment and vote no on this one thank

Speaker hb1 1678 creates a 2-year pilot
 
06:32:32.788 --> 06:32:32.798 align:start position:0%
program to get more local food into
 
06:32:35.310 --> 06:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
local schools the pilot program would
 
06:32:37.510 --> 06:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
encourage schools to spend Federal food
 
06:32:39.910 --> 06:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
dollars in New Hampshire while taking a
 
06:32:42.388 --> 06:32:42.398 align:start position:0%
relatively small investment from the
 
06:32:45.070 --> 06:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
state um as I mentioned in my Pi the
 
06:32:46.590 --> 06:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
majority report referenced the
 
06:32:49.110 --> 06:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
collaborative agreement we have now of
 
06:32:51.590 --> 06:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
federal dollar but that's a short-term
 
06:32:53.750 --> 06:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
program that's set to come to end before
 
06:32:56.548 --> 06:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
the PO pilot program would begin and
 
06:32:58.230 --> 06:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
unlike the collaborative agreement which
 
06:33:00.350 --> 06:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
is only open to schools with a certain
 
06:33:02.110 --> 06:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
number of students receiving free and
 
06:33:04.750 --> 06:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
reduced lunches the pilot program is
 
06:33:07.430 --> 06:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
open to schools to any school across the
 
06:33:10.230 --> 06:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
state to apply and at the end of the
 
06:33:12.670 --> 06:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
pilot program we would have data from
 
06:33:15.430 --> 06:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
all 10 counties about the feasibility of
 
06:33:17.030 --> 06:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
a Statewide
 
06:33:19.190 --> 06:33:19.200 align:start position:0%

Regional Food Systems especially our
 
06:33:23.388 --> 06:33:23.398 align:start position:0%

farms and local communities this bill
 
06:33:32.868 --> 06:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
represents many years of dedicated time

makes the local food economy Thrive the

state who would like to get involved in
 
06:34:05.830 --> 06:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
Farm to school program but need
 
06:34:07.990 --> 06:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
encouragement the pilot program would
 
06:34:09.948 --> 06:34:09.958 align:start position:0%
allow one District in each of 10
 
06:34:12.590 --> 06:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
counties to participate schools across
 
06:34:14.430 --> 06:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
the state can apply to the Department of
 
06:34:16.350 --> 06:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
Agriculture who will put together a
 
06:34:18.670 --> 06:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
committee and criteria to choose
 
06:34:20.590 --> 06:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
participants then the department will
 
06:34:23.948 --> 06:34:23.958 align:start position:0%
also gather data to discern if and how
 
06:34:26.430 --> 06:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
to best go about a farm to school
 
06:34:28.388 --> 06:34:28.398 align:start position:0%
incentive program that would be
 
06:34:30.270 --> 06:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
accessible in the future to all schools
 
06:34:33.230 --> 06:34:33.240 align:start position:0%

Secretary AR of Agriculture Tom vilsack
 
06:34:38.270 --> 06:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
spoke here in New Hampshire he described
 
06:34:39.788 --> 06:34:39.798 align:start position:0%
the many ways that we can support
 
06:34:41.750 --> 06:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
farming and Rural communities in New
 
06:34:44.310 --> 06:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the ways we can do this
 
06:34:45.990 --> 06:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
is by investing in our local and
 
06:34:48.628 --> 06:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
Regional Food Systems the farm to school
 
06:34:51.628 --> 06:34:51.638 align:start position:0%
program does just that not only can we
 
06:34:53.948 --> 06:34:53.958 align:start position:0%
help our rural economies but we can also
 
06:34:56.190 --> 06:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
improve the health and the well-being of
 
06:34:58.708 --> 06:34:58.718 align:start position:0%
our children and the resiliency of our
 
06:35:01.670 --> 06:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
local food system the initial pilot
 
06:35:04.270 --> 06:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
program isn't asking for much let's take
 
06:35:06.110 --> 06:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
the first step in committing to an
 
06:35:08.310 --> 06:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
investment in our Farms our fisheries
 
06:35:11.230 --> 06:35:11.240 align:start position:0%

the itl motion on House Bill
 
06:35:33.628 --> 06:35:33.638 align:start position:0%
1678 this is an unnecessary spending
 
06:35:35.270 --> 06:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
ending of State
 
06:35:39.230 --> 06:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
funds this bill is a duplication of a
 
06:35:42.990 --> 06:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
grant from the federal government only a
 
06:35:45.948 --> 06:35:45.958 align:start position:0%

Committee of this
 
06:35:53.270 --> 06:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:56.910 --> 06:35:56.920 align:start position:0%

million of State dollars and duplicates
 
06:36:11.468 --> 06:36:11.478 align:start position:0%
an existing Federal
 
06:36:14.548 --> 06:36:14.558 align:start position:0%

the fiscal year
 
06:36:20.788 --> 06:36:20.798 align:start position:0%
2026 which is a next
 
06:36:24.310 --> 06:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
bium and by doing so it breaks the
 
06:36:27.948 --> 06:36:27.958 align:start position:0%
unwritten rule that we never encumber a
 
06:36:30.468 --> 06:36:30.478 align:start position:0%

strengthening the agricultural sector
 
06:38:33.590 --> 06:38:33.600 align:start position:0%

if I know that HB 1678 is simply a pilot
 
06:38:51.430 --> 06:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
program with moderate funding that
 
06:38:53.708 --> 06:38:53.718 align:start position:0%

nutritious Foods into our schools and

approved by our fiscal committee for
 
06:39:26.590 --> 06:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
over half a million dollars and if I

parliamentary inquiry if I know that we
 
06:48:25.548 --> 06:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
passed also group two retirement fix at
 
06:48:29.230 --> 06:48:29.240 align:start position:0%

accidental disability retirement and if
 
06:48:35.150 --> 06:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
I further note none of this can be
 
06:48:39.150 --> 06:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
funded unless 15 1560 comes off the
 
06:48:42.270 --> 06:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
table and passes by a two-third majority
 
06:48:44.628 --> 06:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
because all the money we're relying on
 
06:48:46.590 --> 06:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
to fund all these things is in the
 
06:48:49.388 --> 06:48:49.398 align:start position:0%
educational trust fund and it cannot be
 
06:48:52.388 --> 06:48:52.398 align:start position:0%
used for the items I just brought out
 
06:48:55.150 --> 06:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
unless it is taken off the table and
 
06:48:58.670 --> 06:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
passed by a 2/3 so if I know that these
 
06:49:01.150 --> 06:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
are things that are widely supported by
 
06:49:04.030 --> 06:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
all of us here today would I now take
 
06:49:07.468 --> 06:49:07.478 align:start position:0%
1560 off the table and pass it so those
 
06:49:10.150 --> 06:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
things can be funded by General funds
