i've been asked the question recently um
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
well you've got
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
seven different missions because you
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
have seven
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
colleges and i've said no that's that is
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
not the case
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
we absolutely have seven colleges we're
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
at 12 different locations in the state
 
00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
but we all have the same mission and i
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
was trying to think of
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
a way for people to understand how we
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
could have
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
seven independent accreditations but we
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
could still be
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
driven by one mission and i actually
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
thought about the common man restaurants
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
an institution here in the state of new
 
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.870 align:start position:0%
an institution here in the state of new
hampshire

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
when you go to a common man restaurant
 
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
there are certain things that you can
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
expect and whether you are
 
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
in the southern end of the state of the
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
northern end of the state there's a
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
certain flavor
 
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
that comes through and i think that's a
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
good comparison
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
to the community colleges the thing that
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
makes a community college a community
 
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.469 align:start position:0%
makes a community college a community
college

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
is its location we are
 
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
tied to the people and the businesses
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
in a particular area that's what makes
 
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:31.990 align:start position:0%
in a particular area that's what makes
us

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
who we are but in shannon i'll ask you
 
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
to bring up our slides and i'm going to
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
talk about a few of these
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
i will not go through every single one
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
but just to
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
give you a flavor about who
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
who we are so two things drive us
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
that first one is the mission that i've
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
been talking about
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
and our goal is to serve the people of
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
in fact one of the things one of our
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
distinguishing characteristics
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
is that more than 93 percent of the
 
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.990 align:start position:0%
is that more than 93 percent of the
students

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
in our system are new hampshire
 
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.830 align:start position:0%
in our system are new hampshire
residents

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
residents
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
um this year i think our our youngest
 
00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:11.749 align:start position:0%
um this year i think our our youngest
student

00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
is in about 16
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
and our most seasoned student is in her
 
00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:20.390 align:start position:0%
and our most seasoned student is in her
80s

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
80s
 
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
and that i bring those numbers up just
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
to give you a sense
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
that community colleges are here to
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
serve people
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
when they need us so here you go here's
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
a showing of all of us
 
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
all across the state uh in fact
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
our goal was to have a community college
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
or a center within about a half an hour
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
of everybody
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the state so there's the
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
uh sort of the the location business
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
the other piece is affordable and then
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
another slide i'll show you what the
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
impact is
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
of when we have to raise our tuition and
 
00:08:58.399 --> 00:08:59.190 align:start position:0%
of when we have to raise our tuition and
frankly

00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'm very grateful to you because of your
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
assistance we've been able to maintain
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
our tuition currently the state funds
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
so looking at our slide here
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
there are different things one can do at
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
a community college
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
one can gain a certificate an associate
 
00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:25.190 align:start position:0%
one can gain a certificate an associate
degree

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
degree
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
short training longer term training we
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
do customize
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
training with companies and
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
we serve our high school students we
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
create pathways for students to
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
move to gain college credit in high
 
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.269 align:start position:0%
move to gain college credit in high
school

00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
and then move on to the community
 
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.310 align:start position:0%
and then move on to the community
college

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
or the other college of their choice in
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
fact our credits in our
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
running start program are accepted at
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
more than 200
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities and we
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
we're increasing that number because as
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
our high school students go forward
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
to a colleges that we've not yet talked
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
with we add them to the list we speak
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
with folks at different colleges across
 
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
the country
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
and there's a whole bunch of programming
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
that we do that is designed exactly for
 
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.990 align:start position:0%
that we do that is designed exactly for
transfer

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
to four-year institutions
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
but our big game is to be agile
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
so that as things come up we can respond
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
one of the recent examples that has come
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
up is with the lpn
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
program you know we used to be in the
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
lpn business
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
quite a while ago and then as the
 
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.110 align:start position:0%
quite a while ago and then as the
hospitals

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
changed their priorities and they moved
 
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.150 align:start position:0%
changed their priorities and they moved
to

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
magnet hospital status they were telling
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
us very clearly that there wasn't going
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
to be a role for lpns
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
so slowly but surely we went out of the
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
lpn business
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
however in the last two years the need
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
for lpns particularly
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
in nursing homes and healthcare systems
 
00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:56.230 align:start position:0%
in nursing homes and healthcare systems
has

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
arisen and so now we've gone back into
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
that business
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
having started the program again at
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
river valley community college
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
but we're doing things in a different
 
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.150 align:start position:0%
but we're doing things in a different
way

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
where before we would have started a
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
brand new program
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
at whichever of the next college was
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
going to do it
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
now we have a different way of operating
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh the program has started at river
 
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
valley this semester
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
lakes region started a new cohort
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
of the lpn program and frankly
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
this is a model that we're going to
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
continue doing
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
it may be that the state no longer needs
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
this program sometime in the future and
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
creating it at every single college
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
we'll bring it where it needs to be and
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
then when the need subsides
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
we essentially will fold it back up and
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
bring it back to the host college
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
we are in discussions about other
 
00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.430 align:start position:0%
we are in discussions about other
examples

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
examples
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
like that and i bring that up because it
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
gives you a sense
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
of how we are responsive
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
okay so i've talked about mission our
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
mission to be affordable
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
to be accessible to serve the businesses
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
in the communities it's all supported by
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
this notion
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
that we've been talking about for quite
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
a number of years 65 by 25
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
which i suspect you're all very familiar
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
with and so our goal here
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
based on an analysis that was done by a
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
a professor at georgetown university
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
is that for our state to flourish
 
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:38.069 align:start position:0%
is that for our state to flourish
economically

00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
economically
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
65 of our adult residents
 
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
by 2025 need some kind of post-secondary
 
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.870 align:start position:0%
by 2025 need some kind of post-secondary
training

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
and i put it that way because some
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
people need short-term certificates
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
some people need longer experiences
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
some people need associates
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
baccalaureate and graduates degrees
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
but all together we're meaning to serve
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
the need of our state
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
and here are the ways that we do it
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
some of which i've already mentioned and
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
some of which we continue to pursue
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
we're looking for more opportunities
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
with high school students frankly the
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
pandemic has
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
changed so many things for us
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
and as we think about the high school
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
students who are going to go forward
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
some of whom haven't been uh in a
 
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.230 align:start position:0%
some of whom haven't been uh in a
classroom

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
in about a year now those folks are
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
still moving along they're still going
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
to graduate from high school
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
what is it that we do to support them as
 
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.150 align:start position:0%
what is it that we do to support them as
they

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
gain the skill sets that they worked on
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
on their own but they're going to be
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
moving on
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
so high school students we still need to
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
be affordable
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
one of the things that has come up
 
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
is you know why is it that the community
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
college system
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
and the university system didn't work
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
hand in glove
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
on dealing with a pandemic well we did
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
we we certainly have spoken with one
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
another and so on but our needs are very
 
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.150 align:start position:0%
another and so on but our needs are very
different

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
our students are in the community we
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
have some residential students at two of
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
our colleges
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
but our needs are very different in fact
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
if you look at what happened to
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
on account of the pandemic you you get a
 
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.590 align:start position:0%
on account of the pandemic you you get a
sense

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
that that the folks that we serve are
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
living a different life
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
my predecessor chancellor gatel wrote a
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
paper called the two new hampshires
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
and in it he talked about the people
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
of means and the people who don't have
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity well we have an example
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
with a pandemic people anticipated
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
that what's been true for decades would
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
happen and that would be
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
that community colleges would see this
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
huge growth
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
in enrollment because our sort of the
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
the old saw is
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
when times are bad community college
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
enrollment is up and that makes sense
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
because people are trying to
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
um you know brush up on their skills or
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
achieve new skills
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
that is not what happened
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
in fact nationally community colleges
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
are down any place from 10 to 15
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
and we are in that boat we are you know
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
in that in that level of
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
a decline in our enrollment
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
and that's because the students that we
 
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.829 align:start position:0%
and that's because the students that we
serve

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
serve
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
are on the front lines of retail they
 
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.110 align:start position:0%
are on the front lines of retail they
are

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
the lnas in nursing homes
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
they are the young parents who are you
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
know i have kids at home
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
one of the uh challenges for us
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
our frankly the 18 and 19 year olds who
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
are going to come to the community
 
00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:49.430 align:start position:0%
are going to come to the community
college

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
came and they're doing well
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's the 25 plus year olds
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
who have had to step out because of
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
working overtime because of their needs
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
at home and so on
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
and again we look exactly like what's
 
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.749 align:start position:0%
and again we look exactly like what's
happening

00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
nationally to community college students
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
shannon let's move on a bit here
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
and i'll leave this for you to read at
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
some point
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
but what we do changes but not at the
 
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.670 align:start position:0%
but what we do changes but not at the
core

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
core
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
we need to help the people who need to
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
retrain and in fact
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of the programming that we're
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
building right now is exactly
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
to help people back to work we worry
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
about folks in the retail industry
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
and in the hospitality industry those
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
two industries in particular have been
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
profoundly affected
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
as you know well what are the
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
transferable skills
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
i was on a call a few weeks ago
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about the needs in
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
health care which is as you know a huge
 
00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:54.710 align:start position:0%
health care which is as you know a huge
employment

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
employment
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
sector in our state and one of the
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
employers former employers
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
said if i had two resumes in front of me
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
and one was from um an rn
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
who who didn't um who
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
basically had gone to school and was now
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
applying to work
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
and there was a second person there who
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
had worked in hospitality
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps been a bartender sight unseen
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
before i talked to them
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
i'm already thinking i want that person
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
who's been a bartender
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
and it really got me thinking about what
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
are the skills
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
that a bartender needs that are highly
 
00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:34.549 align:start position:0%
that a bartender needs that are highly
transferable

00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
transferable
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
to the healthcare industry bartenders
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
are certainly used to listening to
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
people's life problems
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
they're used to dealing with people at
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
different points in their life and they
 
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.430 align:start position:0%
different points in their life and they
have

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
refined their problem solving skills
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's a good illustration of many of
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
our students these are folks that are
 
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.870 align:start position:0%
our students these are folks that are
working

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
and they have accumulated skills they
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
need a flexible schedule
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
when the cares money first came out
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
it it was doled out to colleges based
 
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:08.710 align:start position:0%
it it was doled out to colleges based
upon

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
upon
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
fte which is full-time equivalent
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
and that didn't support us to the degree
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
that we needed
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
because two-thirds of our student body
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
is part-time one-third full-time
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
so if you're going to come up with the
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
full-time equivalent you kind of
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
mash together two or three people
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
because those two or three students
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
might each be taking
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
one or two classes and so it would take
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
three students for instance
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
to be the equivalent of one fte
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
those three students have needs every
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
one of our college campuses has now
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
opened a food bank
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
every one of our colleges is helping to
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
connect students
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
to all the services our state has fuel
 
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.070 align:start position:0%
to all the services our state has fuel
assistance

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
rent assistance and so on and when the
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
next round of funding carissa came out
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
we were very grateful
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
that our senators really championed a
 
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.150 align:start position:0%
that our senators really championed a
mix

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
mix
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
so it is fte but it also is head count
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
so when i tell you that we serve 26 000
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
people within our state every year
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
we need people the very talented faculty
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
and staff that we have to serve these
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
individuals well
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
and it is a different formula much like
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
before i was referring to
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
the difference in in how covet affected
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
the community colleges uh versus our
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
residential colleges same sort of an
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
issue we
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
we have different needs based upon who
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
and how
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
and shannon has put up on the screen the
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
fact that we
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
pay very careful attention to what the
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
needs of the state are
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
in this very good alignment between the
 
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.470 align:start position:0%
in this very good alignment between the
programming

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
programming
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
that we do and the job opportunities
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
that exist
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
shannon next slide please all right
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit here about how we work
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
with our various companies um
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
two examples for you one is nashua
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
community college
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
and it's worked with bae systems
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
the company and the college worked
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
together to meet a need that the company
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
had for micro electronics
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
technicians so there's a program
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
now at nashua that's been there for
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
probably a couple years
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
that trains people and takes people from
 
00:20:41.919 --> 00:20:42.950 align:start position:0%
that trains people and takes people from
making

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
a very basic wage to a living wage
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
because ultimately that's what we're
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
aiming for
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
um in in one meeting i did let my former
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
background in connecticut show and i
 
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.270 align:start position:0%
background in connecticut show and i
said

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
that the mission of community colleges
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
is to create middle class taxpayers
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
and uh one of the commissioners said to
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
me that that's not new hampshire susan
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
but really staunchly creating the middle
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
class and giving people that opportunity
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
is what community colleges are about
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
and we do that by maintaining
 
00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:20.630 align:start position:0%
and we do that by maintaining
affordability

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
you can see on this slide that shannon
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
is showing us
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
we with your help have been able to
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
maintain our tuition
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
and in fact when we first raised our
 
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.549 align:start position:0%
and in fact when we first raised our
tuition

00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
we saw a decline in enrollment we think
 
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
we are at the price point
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
and i will um say to you
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
about the the whole conversation that
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
we're having
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
about merging the two boards i think
 
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:47.830 align:start position:0%
about merging the two boards i think
this

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
is a good idea i think it's an idea that
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
requires investigation
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
but i'll tell you my fear the university
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
of alaska merged their community
 
00:21:58.799 --> 00:22:00.070 align:start position:0%
of alaska merged their community
colleges

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
and their university system quite a long
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
time ago the late 80s
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
and and people were very cognizant of
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
the community colleges
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
and so initially they were able
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
the university system was able to
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
offer the community college students a
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
lower tuition
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
but as time went on they couldn't do
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
that any longer
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
there were needs and and frankly uh
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
for those of you who may remember an old
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
play the man of la mancha
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
there's a line in it that comes to mind
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
for me here this is
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh whether the stone hits the pitcher
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
or the pitcher hits the stone it's bad
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
for the pitcher
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
the community college system is the
 
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.830 align:start position:0%
the community college system is the
pitcher

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
pitcher
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
and so as we go forward and as you go
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
forward and consider this idea
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
i want you to think about what it is
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
for those two new hampshires if i go
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
statistics that have come up people who
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
are making 150
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
000 or more in our state and across the
 
00:23:06.159 --> 00:23:07.190 align:start position:0%
000 or more in our state and across the
country

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
have been absolutely fine through this
 
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.710 align:start position:0%
have been absolutely fine through this
pandemic

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
the people who are making less than that
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
have experienced
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
one of the points that i'm proudest of
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
is on your screen right now
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
i've talked about creating the middle
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
class uh one of our claims to fame
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
is the value of a community college
 
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.270 align:start position:0%
is the value of a community college
education

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
people in our state who've attained a
 
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.510 align:start position:0%
people in our state who've attained a
degree

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
degree
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
have moved two or more economic
 
00:23:42.159 --> 00:23:43.190 align:start position:0%
have moved two or more economic
quintiles

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
quintiles
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
from where their parents are as a parent
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
you want your children to do better than
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
and we are like the good housekeeping or
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
we have like the good housekeeping seal
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
of approval
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
our students do well and in fact
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
our two rural colleges white mountains
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
and river valley
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
are they they actually lead the nation
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
in terms of what the impact
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
of a community college education is for
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
these folks
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
this slide here looks at graduation rate
 
00:24:17.919 --> 00:24:18.630 align:start position:0%
this slide here looks at graduation rate
um

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
one thing about graduation rate you can
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
see that our graduation rate is
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
33 and you might say well you know
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
what are you so excited about susan with
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
a graduation rate of 33 percent
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
but i want you to understand where that
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
comes from so this is a federal
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
requirement so a brand new
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
which is called a first-time freshman is
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
part of this
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
count and then for our
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
community colleges they look at how many
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
of those students graduate in three
 
00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:56.549 align:start position:0%
of those students graduate in three
years

00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
what happens to our students is they
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
start off full-time
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
and then family and work
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
get in the way and i don't i hesitate to
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
say get in the way because those are
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely crucial pieces so that
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
student who started off full-time
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
three years from now may very well still
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
be with us
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
but he or she is not full-time
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
and so they are con we are considered a
 
00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:25.830 align:start position:0%
and so they are con we are considered a
failure

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
failure
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
because they didn't graduate within the
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
three-year period
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
if you look at what's happening in
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
you can see that we are outpacing
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
our sister institutions and we've done
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
that because of work we've done
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
with national entities to raise the
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
graduation rate
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
to look for ways to sustain people
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
we've grown by 10 percentage points in
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
five years
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
we want to grow at least that over the
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
next five years
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
um shannon is bringing us through
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
um a list of all of the employers that
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
we have done work with
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
several more pages here um i hope that
 
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
i've given you
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
background about who we are and the work
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
i see eversource here i had mentioned i
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you two examples and i
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
only gave you one with bae
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
and nashua eversource has worked with
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
manchester community college
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
to create a line worker program
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
those folks are with us for less than a
 
00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.830 align:start position:0%
those folks are with us for less than a
year

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
and their average starting salary is
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
about 75
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
000 there's still more opportunity there
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
there's more opportunity to work with
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
all of our
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
partners and i i'm pleased to tell you
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
that we continue to do that work
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
despite the pandemic so i think i've
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
left maybe just a couple of minutes
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
scott will you take us through the
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you chancellor hewitt
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody my name is scott
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
fields i'm the chief operating officer
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
of the community college system
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
i am at home in intervale new hampshire
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
my family is on the first floor not the
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
basement so i think i'm doing
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay i just wanted to run through
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
the fy 22-23 efficiency budget you know
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
this request
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
is developed with a focus on the
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
continual improvement of our student
 
00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.549 align:start position:0%
continual improvement of our student
outcomes

00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier in this presentation
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
and as chancellor hewitt just said
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
this outlook has allowed ccsnh to become
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
a leading community college system in
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
all of new england in terms of these
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
graduation rates and economic mobility
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
with this in mind the requested increase
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
over the biennium will allow us to
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
maintain these
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
student first focus and to continue to
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
be a key component in the state's
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
economic engine and recovery during this
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
challenging time
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
the state's support of ccsnh's mission
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
is a crucial component of our funding
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
matrix as a percentage of our tuition
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
and fees revenue compared to state
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation has shifted
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
quite significantly over the last five
 
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.310 align:start position:0%
quite significantly over the last five
years

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
just to give you in terms of the
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
national perspective the average
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
reliance on tuition and fee revenue at a
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
community college is roughly 33
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
ccsnh is approximately 17
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
higher than that or nearly 50 so your
 
00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:21.269 align:start position:0%
higher than that or nearly 50 so your
support

00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
over the last few years has provided us
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
the ability to continue the success that
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
and to just look at the numbers within
 
00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:31.110 align:start position:0%
and to just look at the numbers within
our

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:35.799 align:start position:0%
budget request the increase from fy21 to
 
00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:36.950 align:start position:0%
budget request the increase from fy21 to
fy22

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
fy22
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
is 5.3 million dollars the vast majority
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
is predicated from our three collective
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
and mandated increases for things
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
similar to the
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state retirement system uh
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
mandates that come out each and every
 
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.230 align:start position:0%
mandates that come out each and every
year

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
so from fy21 to fy 22 a prime example
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
of this is the retirement system
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
increase is going to cost the
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
community college system nearly 1.5
 
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars from fy21 to fy22
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
that dollar amount is nearly 65 percent
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
of our overall benefits increase in that
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
one year
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
so essentially your continued support
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
will help us to maintain the systems
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
and our positive outlooks that we have
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
and continue to go forward as chancellor
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
hewitt just said we're looking to
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
continue to grow
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
these outcomes over the next few years
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
um sorry just getting my place here
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
so over the next oh thank you shannon so
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
what happens is in the fy 22 budget we
 
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
are state
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
we're flat funded with the state dollars
 
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh that will allow us to continue where
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
we were at right now
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
while trying to find a way of absorbing
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
the 5.3 million dollar
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
contractual increases that we need to
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
have in order to maintain
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
the successful outcomes that we're
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
continuing to grow
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
with the fy 23 budget in question
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
being rolled into one bucket there's
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
significant work that needs to happen
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
over the
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
next few years or in the next year or
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
two that will help us understand
 
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what our individual budget will
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
look like at that
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
one last thing just to go ahead
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
oh sorry uh
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
but one thing to just keep in mind is
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
you know ccna ccsnh excuse me prides
 
00:30:37.039 --> 00:30:37.830 align:start position:0%
you know ccna ccsnh excuse me prides
itself

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
on being nimble and entrepreneurial over
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
the last few years
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
we have worked diligently as
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
all other state agencies have to reduce
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
costs and maintain costs where necessary
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
our operating costs have dropped by
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
nearly eight percent from
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
fy 18 through fy20 we take being
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsible actions
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
each and every year in each and every
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
budget in order to
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
control our costs to show good
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
stewardship of the money that the state
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
provides to the system
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
this is something that we will keep
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
going scott i just wanted to
 
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
show these as people are listening uh so
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know we definitely pride ourselves
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
in this fashion and being able to be
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
good stewards of the funds that you
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
provide to us
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
and look forward to continue to do that
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
again the request that we're
 
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
seeking will allow us to maintain that
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
same level of service
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
across the board to our students so it's
 
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:36.310 align:start position:0%
across the board to our students so it's
just

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's important that we are able to
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
continue to move that needle especially
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
when it comes to 65 by 25.
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
again we are a key component and
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
economic driver of the state's recovery
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
especially in times like this when
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
there's so many structurally unemployed
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
folks that do need to be
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
retold as chancellor hewitt mentioned
 
00:31:58.840 --> 00:31:59.990 align:start position:0%
retold as chancellor hewitt mentioned
earlier

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh shannon would you comment on these
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
slides and representative on the
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
burger i know we're slightly over but if
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
we could have one more minute please
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
no problem i tacked these slides on as
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
an appendix these come from
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
brian gottlob an economist with the
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
labor market information bureau
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
and it looks really at what are those
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
professions that
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
are um they're in demand right now and
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
then projected forward to be in demand
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
and so many of them fall at the
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
associate degree or
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
certificate level which is the level of
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
education that we
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
um kind of specialize in so this is just
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
some detail that
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
um that rolls up to the larger theme
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
that the community colleges really exist
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
to meet these
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
workforce needs in ways that match
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
the demographics of our community and
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
the demands within
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
within each of our communities all
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
across the state and and so i guess i i
 
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:50.950 align:start position:0%
across the state and and so i guess i i
wanted

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
you to see this because this isn't just
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
us saying this
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
this is um you know very very well
 
00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.269 align:start position:0%
this is um you know very very well
regarded

00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
regarded
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
economists saying this who have looked
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
at this data and this is what this is
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
what they do for
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
for a living and it's really folds into
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
everything that we've been saying about
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
our role here in the state of new
 
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.950 align:start position:0%
our role here in the state of new
hampshire

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you shannon we'll be happy to
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
answer questions this afternoon we look
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
forward to the conversation
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
as part of the package that we've sent
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
you there's also
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
a link to a document that gives you
 
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
some information about how mergers have
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
played out in other states
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
and because as this goes forward
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
i always say to the folks that work with
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
me let's make new mistakes
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
so we need to keep history in mind we
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
need to look at
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
what others have done and then build on
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
that and
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
we're confident that you can help this
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%

morning
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
so um you were provided with some slides
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
and i would like to to walk you through
 
00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.150 align:start position:0%
and i would like to to walk you through
that

that
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see the difference in the
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
presentation between
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
interim chancellor heward and myself in
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
that i
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
have spent my career in finding it's
 
00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.270 align:start position:0%
have spent my career in finding it's
probably

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
heavier in much heavier in numbers than
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
than susan's presentation
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
um i hundred percent concur with susan's
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
comments she and i have been working
 
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.150 align:start position:0%
comments she and i have been working
collaboratively

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
collaboratively
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
a number of months now and um i look
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
forward to
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
to continuing that even though i think
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
susan's probably looking forward to her
 
00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
actual retirement in the not too distant
 
00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.670 align:start position:0%
actual retirement in the not too distant
future

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
so um i will share my screen here if
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
and and walk you through um some
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
information about the university system
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
so as as susan mentioned you know the
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
community college system and the
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
university system do
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
have distinct missions but the one thing
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
we do have inc
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
in common is that we are a public
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
resource to to all granite staters
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
and the university system is also
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
focused on workforce development
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
in addition you know over 140 million
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
is in research is conducted here in new
 
00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.270 align:start position:0%
is in research is conducted here in new
hampshire

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
primarily at unh we also administer the
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
cooperative extension program across the
 
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:21.430 align:start position:0%
cooperative extension program across the
state

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
which has impact as you know in all in
 
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
all corners of new hampshire
 
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
we also have a number of programs that
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
provide direct community impact all
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
around new hampshire
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to walk through the
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
details on all of these slides
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
by all means if you have questions later
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
you can certainly follow up
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
um the covid as you know has just
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
turned life upside down for
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
everyone in the state and the university
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
system has really
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
partnered with the state on a number of
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
initiatives since the beginning of the
 
00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:00.470 align:start position:0%
initiatives since the beginning of the
pandemic

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
setting up surge facilities we're doing
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
high capacity testing not just for our
 
00:38:05.119 --> 00:38:06.069 align:start position:0%
high capacity testing not just for our
students

00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
but also for partnering with the
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
the unh
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
lab is being used to test to test
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
folks in nursing homes and correctional
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
facilities et cetera
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
healthcare workforce we've got had
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
nursing students
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
come into the workforce earlier than
 
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
they might have otherwise or not for the
 
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.589 align:start position:0%
they might have otherwise or not for the
pandemic

00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
we also have a vaccine distribution
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
center over in keene
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
again part of the public mission of the
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
university system is stepping up in
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we had to completely
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
pivot the way we
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
we provide education to our students
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
back in the
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
last to a year ago that continues we
 
00:38:49.359 --> 00:38:50.230 align:start position:0%
last to a year ago that continues we
provide

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
hybrid courses different
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
adjustments to our calendars increase
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
support students for
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
susan mentioned the impact this has had
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
on high schools
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
and it has also had significant impact
 
00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:08.950 align:start position:0%
and it has also had significant impact
on

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
the learning and the support services
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
our students need
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
we have been very fortunate to receive
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
direct federal support
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
as well as support through the state
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
gopher office we
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
when we combine fiscal years 20 and 21
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
we estimate right now we still have
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
about 46 million dollars in unrecovered
 
00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.670 align:start position:0%
about 46 million dollars in unrecovered
costs

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
our costs for testing ppe
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
cleaning all of that over 20 and fiscal
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
years 20 and 21 is about 80 million
 
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.589 align:start position:0%
years 20 and 21 is about 80 million
dollars

00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
we have about 76 million dollars in
 
00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
revenue losses that can be from
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
dorms taken offline for quarantine
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
summer program losses we
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
incurred you know when students have to
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
go in a hybrid model
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
many of them don't want to come and live
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
on campus if they
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
if they have a lot of online courses so
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
revenue losses there as well of course
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of operational savings
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
when you when you
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
effectively shut down a campus you have
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
savings there you don't have the energy
 
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.349 align:start position:0%
savings there you don't have the energy
bills

00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
no one's traveling no you know we have
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh so that we have
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
also achieved significant operational
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
savings but there is a
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
so before the pandemic
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
we knew that we were coming we were in
 
00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.510 align:start position:0%
we knew that we were coming we were in
headwinds

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
headwinds
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
and the headwinds were going to get much
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
stronger in the coming years
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
this chart was published last month in
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
the the chronicle of higher education
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
and you can see in the northeast
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
by 2025 the number of high school
 
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.510 align:start position:0%
by 2025 the number of high school
students

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
is going to sharply decline
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
and so we need to prepare for that
 
00:40:59.839 --> 00:41:00.230 align:start position:0%
and so we need to prepare for that
that's

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
also part of just in the last few years
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
just the competition that we see around
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
new england
 
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
for for students of the state of maine
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
you you have seen billboards
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
they are offering in-state tuition to
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
out-of-state students that's just an
 
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.109 align:start position:0%
out-of-state students that's just an
example

00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
so we know we have to prepare for this
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
big drop-off
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
in in the number of high school students
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
coming into the pipeline
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
you couple that with our students have
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
increased financial need
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
our students and their families have
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
increased financial need
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
and the pandemic has exacerbated that so
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
while we have
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
this is just through 21. enrollments
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
stick down a little bit
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
because of demographics because of
 
00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:42.870 align:start position:0%
because of demographics because of
competition

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
competition
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
the financial aid our students require
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
is increasing
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
and that puts pressure on the bottom
 
00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.230 align:start position:0%
and that puts pressure on the bottom
line

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
i will say that this this projection for
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
is exclusive of one time covet impacts
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to model kind of
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
parsing out the recurring activity
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
from this one-time activity so that we
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
can plan for the future
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
and that gets me to this this modeling
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
we built a roadmap if you will last
 
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.950 align:start position:0%
we built a roadmap if you will last
spring

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
spring
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
knowing that these headwinds we were
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
coming into what do we need to do
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
by fiscal 23 when this pandemic is
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
behind us
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we are on a path of
 
00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.829 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we are on a path of
fiscal

00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
we put a bunch of assumptions in the
 
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.870 align:start position:0%
we put a bunch of assumptions in the
modeling

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
modeling
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
demographic declines for enrollment
 
00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:36.069 align:start position:0%
demographic declines for enrollment
increased

00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
increased
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
student financial aid and a number of
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
other assumptions
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
we we also assumed flat state funding
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
for 22 and 23 when we built that model
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
flat with what the operating the the
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
recurring operating support if you will
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
based on that roadmap we need to take
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
70 million out of our cost structure
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
or about nine percent of our budget by
 
00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:03.990 align:start position:0%
or about nine percent of our budget by
2023

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
and we are on a path to do just that
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
very high level this is university
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
system wide
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
the modeling shows how our revenue is
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
going to continue to deteriorate
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
and so we need to take 70 million
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
dollars out
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
to get to a place with a very small
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
amount in the black so what are we doing
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
frankly we are restructuring everything
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
we can get our hands on
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
the first thing we did on fit in for
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21 budget
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
everyone had to roll back to fiscal 19
 
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.230 align:start position:0%
everyone had to roll back to fiscal 19
actuals

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
actuals
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
we are restructuring all financial and
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
administrative services across the
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
university system we are
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
up to our eyeballs in that right now we
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
are restructuring our entire benefits
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
program and there are that's that's
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
system-wide there are also a number of
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
campus specific restructuring and
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
expense reduction
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
initiatives in place so we can achieve
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
so this shows you the um the state
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
operating support now i can tell you
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
this excludes the one time when i
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the reduction that we
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
that we um
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
have in house bill one as proposed by
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
this this percentage does not include
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
that one-time money
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
we received one-time money back in well
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
that's a typo this should say fiscal 20.
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
um so the governor's
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
proposed a four and a half million
 
00:44:34.319 --> 00:44:35.109 align:start position:0%
proposed a four and a half million
dollar

00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
cut in fiscal 22 from our current
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
eighty eight and a half million dollars
 
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's about a five percent reduction
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
now i can tell you what i admittedly i
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
don't know what this is going to look
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
like for fiscal 23
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
so i just took 60 like it is now
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's another reduction is the only
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
point there from fiscal 22 to fiscal 23.
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
our board uh when we when we
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
put our agency requests together the
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
flat funding at 88.5 million dollars
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
we committed to continue to freeze
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
over the upcoming biennium and it's also
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
it was also frozen in the academic year
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
we're in now
 
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me our board just approved an
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition freeze last month for
 
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.190 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition freeze last month for
the

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
fall and um
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
that again that assumed the 88.5 million
 
00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:31.750 align:start position:0%
that again that assumed the 88.5 million
dollars

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
we have not had any discussions about
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
changing that but that's uh
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to have impact on us again
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
put more pressure as we
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
take that 70 million out of the cost
 
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.670 align:start position:0%
take that 70 million out of the cost
structure

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
what do we use the appropriation for
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
effectively tuition subsidy we buy down
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
the state buys down in-state tuition
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
we also fund services such as
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
cooperative extension
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
the agricultural experiment station and
 
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.589 align:start position:0%
the agricultural experiment station and
others

00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
and the total state appropriate the
 
00:46:09.599 --> 00:46:11.510 align:start position:0%
and the total state appropriate the
operating

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
operating
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
state appropriation funds about 10
 
00:46:14.079 --> 00:46:14.870 align:start position:0%
state appropriation funds about 10
percent

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
of the total university systems
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
this is a graph showing again the
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
continued and
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
increasing need on the part of our
 
00:46:25.119 --> 00:46:26.309 align:start position:0%
increasing need on the part of our
students

00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
so the the usnh funded direct student
 
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.870 align:start position:0%
so the the usnh funded direct student
aid

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
aid
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
is continuing to increase each year
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
and back in 2018 you may recall
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
we um the university system adopted the
 
00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
granite guarantee program
 
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
effectively having free tuition for
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
students who are
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
eligible by fiscal 21 you'll see we'll
 
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
have four years of that
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
in the you know this pipeline of
 
00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:53.990 align:start position:0%
in the you know this pipeline of
students

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
that's about 18.7 million dollars we
 
00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.309 align:start position:0%
that's about 18.7 million dollars we
estimate

00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
you're also aware we provide um
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
tuition waivers to national guard
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
members that's about 2.7 million dollars
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
last year um or 722 national guard
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
waivers and
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
effective this july 1st we have
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
um the tuition waiver for dependents of
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
disabled veterans and that will start
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
this summer
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
you can see the difference here this is
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
tuition and fees the difference
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
between an out of state and a resident
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
this is what we call the sticker price
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
when you look at the net price after
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
financial aid
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much stayed the same since
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal 16.
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
i would guess that by fiscal 21 that's
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
going to tick down a little bit
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
because we held tuition flat and
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
financial aid continues to increase
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
these are metrics your you you may
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me i've seen them in the past we
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
provide a dashboard
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
to the state treasurer's office
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
quarterly you can find the entire
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
dashboard on this link or on the state
 
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:03.750 align:start position:0%

treasurer's website we continue to have
 
00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:07.910 align:start position:0%
treasurer's website we continue to have
the

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
the highest graduation rate of the new
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
england publics
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
i use six year because that's what the
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
the federal government uses
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
we also have a lowest student loan
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
default rate what we take from that is
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
our students are able to graduate on
 
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.870 align:start position:0%
our students are able to graduate on
time

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
and gain employment to pay off their
 
00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:29.990 align:start position:0%
and gain employment to pay off their
loans

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
loans
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
and then we also have the
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
lowest administrative expense per
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
student in relation to our
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
public peers around new england
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of other items in the
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
budget that i both house bill 1 and
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 i just want to make you
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to tread very lightly on this
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
this topic here
 
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
the um the uh
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen the final language yet
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
but in house bill 2
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
there's a loan repayment program and i
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
have to tell you that
 
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
i'll speak for myself that program could
 
00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:05.990 align:start position:0%
i'll speak for myself that program could
have

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
real impact on workforce economic and
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
business development in the state
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
um and again i'll speak for myself
 
00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:14.870 align:start position:0%
um and again i'll speak for myself
that's

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
probably a very impactful program
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
the program will be funded by
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
redirecting about sixty percent
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the dollars in the unique program
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
each year and those those dollars
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
fund currently fund
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
an endowment portion to that unique
 
00:49:36.079 --> 00:49:38.069 align:start position:0%
an endowment portion to that unique
program

00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
i i want to be clear that that endowment
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
can only be used the the
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
earnings on the endowment can only be
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
used for student scholarships
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's a trust document it can't be used
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
for anything else
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
the impact of of this
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
redirection with no other changes
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
in rule would be about two hundred
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
less per year in scholarships for our
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
neediest new hampshire students
 
00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
and that grows so it's two hundred
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in the first year
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
four hundred thousand in the second year
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
it and
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
and on and on six hundred eight hundred
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
um we
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
i would also agree that there should
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
probably be a
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
a change in the way that the out that
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
allocation is split right now
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
as far as what goes into direct
 
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
scholarships and what goes into
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
endowment um but i'm i'm sure you're
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
well aware of this
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh i have not yet attended my first
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
commission meeting
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
and unique commission meeting in my uh
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
added role so again i'm trending lightly
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
on this but it is it is
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
an area that could impact
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
university students in the future the
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
other item
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
in house bill 1 excuse me
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
funding is zeroed out for these two
 
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.030 align:start position:0%
funding is zeroed out for these two
programs

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
that are administered through unh
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
their federal programs and the match has
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
been the federal match
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
well i should say the state match has
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
been funded by
 
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
this the state in past years
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
this um sbdc small
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
business development corp is required
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
that it be hosted in a college or
 
00:51:31.839 --> 00:51:33.109 align:start position:0%
that it be hosted in a college or
university

00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
university
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
unh has proudly hosted it for 36 years
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
it provides about four hundred thousand
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in in-kind support
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
but the match this year has been wiped
 
00:51:43.119 --> 00:51:44.630 align:start position:0%
but the match this year has been wiped
out

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
and excuse me also there's a innovation
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
research center
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
which is a state statutory program
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
the state support for that has also been
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
zeroed out
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
so are we are
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
were we to continue the program that
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
will be about another 1.4 million
 
00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:05.349 align:start position:0%
will be about another 1.4 million
dollars

00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
over the biennium that would need to be
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
absorbed by the university system
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
in addition to the reduction in our
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
that is going to conclude
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
my presentation i um
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
i hope to provide you some time for
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
questions if possible
 
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
but i want to close with
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
the reduction in the university systems
 
00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.069 align:start position:0%
the reduction in the university systems
operating

00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
operating
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
appropriation will have impact
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
one at a time when we are doing
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
everything we can
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
to reduce our costs to get
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
back to a place after the pandemic of
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal sustainability
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
and you'll find my direct
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
contact as well as toms at the end of
 
00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
your presentation
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
i would urge anyone to um
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much if you hear noise in
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
the background someone's trying to call
 
00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:13.349 align:start position:0%
the background someone's trying to call
me

00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
that's one of the uh the bad things
 
00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:17.030 align:start position:0%
that's one of the uh the bad things
about

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
zoom is that your telephone rings no
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
matter what and
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
uh it's hard to uh it's hard to prevent
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
that from happening
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
but uh thank you uh thank you very much
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
um we appreciate it and
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
um i read
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
you know sort of the listen to the draft
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
language i guess about
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
unique and that's obviously
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
something that if you don't know a lot
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
about it we're going to have to learn
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
a lot about unique the 529 program
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
as well as the uh as well as the two
 
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
other programs that
 
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh were mentioned um
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.839 --> 00:54:09.990 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
we need to we need to be aware of we
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
need to make decisions on
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
and um we'll see what happens so
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
to that point representative umberger if
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
if there's
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
in an interest um i'm sure the community
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
college system can as well
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
there are other groups in the state that
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
that may be able to inform you even
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
better than we can on those topics so
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
happy to connect you with those those
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
folks if
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful oh i'm sure it will
 
00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:42.870 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful oh i'm sure it will
be

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
so uh we're now going to turn
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
is the governor going to be able to join
 
00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:05.589 align:start position:0%
is the governor going to be able to join
us

00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
or not i believe he is still on track
 
00:55:09.359 --> 00:55:09.670 align:start position:0%
or not i believe he is still on track
for

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
11 30 so it might just be another minute
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions to kick
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
things off or if the committee wants to
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
take a five minute recess
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh whatever your preference is uh
 
00:55:22.559 --> 00:55:23.589 align:start position:0%
uh whatever your preference is uh
chairman

00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you why don't we just uh kind
 
00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:27.030 align:start position:0%
okay thank you why don't we just uh kind
of

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
go in a holding pattern a recess and
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
we'll be when he shows up mickey will uh
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
there is that return kathy for
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh for your presentations this morning i
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
think that it
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh really helped us to
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
see the overall impact of uh both the
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
community college systems
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
and the uh university system and uh
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh i think in the in the past we have
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
uh or at least i have not in the past
 
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
i understand the systems but haven't
 
00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:21.670 align:start position:0%
i understand the systems but haven't
necessarily

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
delved into all of the things that need
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
and this proposal
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
my concept of uh of what's going on
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
in the in the two systems so um
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
i uh i really do appreciate what
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh what you've presented this afternoon
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
or this morning i'm sorry and okay
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
the governor is with us so um
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
oh good good morning governor um
 
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
i would like hope okay and uh i'd like
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
welcome you to uh division two and
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
to uh speak to us about your vision
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
of the uh combination
 
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
of the university system and the
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
community college system so thank you
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
very much and we're looking forward to
 
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
hearing from you
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
sure sure well i appreciate the
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come to uh to
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
i was gonna say come over but i guess
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
we're all sitting in our own locations
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
right now um
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
so i mean just not to be repetitive but
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
to reiterate a little bit of
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
of what we i talked about in the budget
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
address and then we can take it into
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
kind of another level of detail
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
um this is just all about evolving our
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
system so that so it doesn't get crushed
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean to speak in such
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
hyperbole but that's that's really
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
um ultimately nationally where a lot of
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
these systems uh if they do not evolve
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh meet the needs of the consumer that
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
being the student the parent
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
the new paradigm as i call it of
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
variables that parents and students are
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
looking at when they're making decisions
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
to enter
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
a higher education or to go into the
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
military or to get a job right out of
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
high school
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
we can't just keep pumping and it isn't
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
just about the dollars but you can't
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
just keep
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
pumping up the same old system decade
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
after decade after decade and expected
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
to be successful you have to evolve
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
with the times and and with where the
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
market is going um
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
we know that uh you know what we're
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
talking about today
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
was something that was seen maybe five
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
or ten years out
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of a real dynamic shift in
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
where higher education was going
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh studies three or four years ago were
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
showing that
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
up to 50 percent of mid-sized colleges
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
closing their doors uh in the next in
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
the next you know i think it's a
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
five to ten or fifteen years um and
 
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
really what covett has done is kovat has
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
accelerated all of that
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
really right so um you know because
 
00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.470 align:start position:0%
really right so um you know because
kovid

00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
kovid
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
forced the issue of a lot of folks that
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
previously may not have considered
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
something like online education
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
or or folks who might have been saying
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
well it's got to be a four-year college
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
but you know what
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
because of cova now they're looking at
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
other alternatives they're looking at
 
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:16.549 align:start position:0%
other alternatives they're looking at
other

00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
other pathways and so all this has
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
really been accelerated and so what
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
we're really trying to do is to say
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
other states have done it some have been
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
successful some not as
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
successful but there are good models out
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
there and we're saying why is it that we
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
have two systems that effectively
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
compete against each other that offer
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
very different pathways
 
00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
and that are very siloed so you have
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
effectively really uh
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
the seven individual locations in the
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
community college
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
the four within the university system
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
that's really 11 different
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
um systems well let's get them into one
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
and the benefit there isn't just about
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
saving dollars i got to be honest i
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
think we'll save some money but i don't
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
really care about that that's not what
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
this is about at all
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's really about creating a pathway
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
that is much more conducive for that
 
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:01.990 align:start position:0%
that is much more conducive for that
student

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
um the students of this gen z or
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
whatever generation is coming next i'm
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
not sure what we're going to call them
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
but this next gen z and the students of
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
the future are really about options are
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
really about smooth transitions
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
are really about making sure and going
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
into a system saying well maybe i don't
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
know what i want to do at 18 or 19.
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
maybe i had a plan on a four year
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
but now i want to go to two year or now
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
i want to get a job or whatever it is
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
asking that student or telling that
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
student well you have to get out of this
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
system and reapply and get into this
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
system over here and it's completely
 
01:00:33.359 --> 01:00:34.470 align:start position:0%
system over here and it's completely
different

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
it's com it's massively inefficient and
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
it just creates a better a rougher
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
outcome if you will a rougher pathway
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
for that student
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
as as opposed to saying look new
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire is one unified system you come
 
01:00:45.839 --> 01:00:46.150 align:start position:0%
hampshire is one unified system you come
in

01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
you can take a hundred different
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
pathways right and that's and it's
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
seamless and it's easy
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
do you know right now we have over i
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
think you guys may have discussed this
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
over 100
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
agreements between all the different
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
between nashua community college and unh
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
and plymouth state and
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
manchester for college credit transfer
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
and what
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
what transfers and what doesn't there's
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
literally over 100 agreements out there
 
01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:09.990 align:start position:0%
literally over 100 agreements out there
it's

01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
massively confusing on the back end and
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
it just
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
i think accentuates the fact that we
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
don't make it smooth for students
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
we make it a challenge we can say that
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
issues with uh we allow credits to
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
transfer over but not always and not for
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
all classes
 
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
and it's still going out of one system
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
and into another and so this is all
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
about uh i call it
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
if you will school choice for higher
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
education right
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
um and that is where choice is most
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
important because that's where these
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
young adults are really making their
 
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
decisions about their future about their
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
careers about their jobs
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
and so it isn't just having i always
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
give the example of
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know a nursing student who wants to
 
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
do a research and development project at
 
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:50.870 align:start position:0%
do a research and development project at
unh

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
unh
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
but she's a nursing student at
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
manchester community college why why
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we allow that to happen
 
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
in a seamless way or someone at plymouth
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
state that wants to that says you know
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
what i'm taking some great classes at
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
plymouth state but i want to be more
 
01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.270 align:start position:0%
plymouth state but i want to be more
hands-on

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
hands-on
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
right i want to be a business major but
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
i want to also i want to be in the
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
the construction mechanical field i want
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
to take welding courses to
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
to know what you know what that end of
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
my of my career path that i'm trying to
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
design for myself
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
is so it's not just business classes
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
here but it's business and hands-on
 
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.390 align:start position:0%
here but it's business and hands-on
classes

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
classes
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
um that again when that student
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
graduates with that degree and moves on
 
01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:25.839 align:start position:0%
they're just so much more prepared and
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
as a parent
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm going to take my governor
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
head off as a parent i come at it from
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
i got a 15 year old and i got a 16 year
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
old so i'm
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
i'm going through this dynamic
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
questioning myself of
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
for my kids okay well what system is
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
best what system
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
is going to provide the most pathways
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
because my kids don't necessarily know
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
aren't going to know what they what they
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
want to do i didn't necessarily know
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to do at 18
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
and you know you kind of pick a school
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
or pick a pathway and you hope for the
 
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.029 align:start position:0%
or pick a pathway and you hope for the
best

01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
i just think that we have an opportunity
 
01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
to create massive efficiencies
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
and not ask students and parents to do
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
the will hope for the best
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
come on in with an idea of what you want
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
to do but even if you change your mind
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
even if you find something more exciting
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
or something more interesting or that
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
something that suits your skill set that
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
that same system is going to be there
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
to provide for that and so that's really
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
what this is about now
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
we didn't come in and pre-prescribe
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
exactly what this should look like i
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
i engage with the community college i
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
see shannon on here i engaged with
 
01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:22.309 align:start position:0%
see shannon on here i engaged with
shannon

01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
shannon
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
oh boy well over a year ago i think and
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
we batted around some ideas
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
i brought then brought some board
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
members in from both the community
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
college and the university system and
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
said look
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
let's start designing this let's start
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
planning this
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
and i i don't i mean they were on board
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
with the concept
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
but i i think to be honest i think they
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
were hesitant because they just didn't
 
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:42.950 align:start position:0%
were hesitant because they just didn't
know

01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
if they were going to spend a lot of
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
time designing a system but get pushed
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
back here or there from their own boards
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
or their faculty or whatever it was
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
so there just wasn't an impetus to
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
really drive forward and say we got to
 
01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
get this thing done
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
our pathway now is to say we're going to
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
take five members of the community
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
college five members of the university
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
system board put them together
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
we'll then see what the gaps are and by
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
that i mean
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know maybe some folks from one
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
system or another they have some
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
financial experience emerging and
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
acquisition experience but that we don't
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
have any legal experience on that board
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
because there's going to be some legal
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
issues with this merger
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
i then will bring in five more members
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
to with skill sets to fill in those gaps
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
where it needs to be not political wonks
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
or anything like that just
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
folks that know how to actually get this
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
done and what i've been very clear to
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
both boards is
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
you can pick who you want but this isn't
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
showing up for a board meeting once a
 
01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:33.430 align:start position:0%
showing up for a board meeting once a
month

01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
checking a box and having a couple
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
discussions i need five individuals on
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
both sides that want to
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
really dig in get their hands dirty look
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
at the financials the it mergers
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh the what's going on in the back end
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
how to make it a seamless
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
um uh a curriculum program uh for the
 
01:04:49.839 --> 01:04:51.029 align:start position:0%
um uh a curriculum program uh for the
students

01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
how to bring faculty together right um
 
01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
and we've gotten a lot of very positive
 
01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:55.750 align:start position:0%
and we've gotten a lot of very positive
feedback

01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
obviously it's on both sides of the
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
aisle you know on the political spectrum
 
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
so we know it's not a political issue
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of positive feedback
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
from faculty from students and parents
 
01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:04.870 align:start position:0%
from faculty from students and parents
are

01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
thrilled with this concept and what
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
we're saying is
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
we could study this some more we know
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
where that what happens with that
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
um or we could just get in and we can do
 
01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:15.670 align:start position:0%
um or we could just get in and we can do
um

01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
we just don't have the time right now if
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
you will to take five years and see how
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
it goes and study this and study that
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
the data is clear it's out there it's
 
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
been studied it's
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's all right there for us so that's
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
not the hard part
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
um actually getting the right folks in
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
the room and making this happen and
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
i've given what my idea is to give them
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
a kind of a one year deadline it doesn't
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
mean the whole system has to be done
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
finished design
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
finito in a year i don't think that's a
 
01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.549 align:start position:0%
finito in a year i don't think that's a
practical

01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
practical
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
expectation but it but we have to i
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
think give them
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
the idea to bring something back to the
 
01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.510 align:start position:0%
the idea to bring something back to the
legislature

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
give them a year to do the design bring
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
something back to the legislature
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
knowing that it's going to get tweaked
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
it might be a plan a or a plan b or a
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
plan c
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to hit some bumps in the
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
road to start but really kind of lay out
 
01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:01.270 align:start position:0%
road to start but really kind of lay out
that

01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
framework of design over the next six to
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
six to 12 months
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
and then come back to both the
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
legislature and the people of new
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire and say this is what this is
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
going to look like
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
and go if you don't do it now if you
 
01:06:12.799 --> 01:06:13.349 align:start position:0%
and go if you don't do it now if you
stall

01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
stall
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
and study and wait it ain't ever going
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
to happen and where our two systems are
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
going to wither on the vine
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be competitive and
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
and more importantly
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to keep competing against
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
each other i mean the massive
 
01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.990 align:start position:0%
each other i mean the massive
inefficiencies

01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
because as you go to online learning
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
right you you have
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
the community colleges doing some online
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
stuff you have the university doing some
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
online stuff
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
unh you have plymouth doing some they're
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
both they're all competing against the
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
private sector the snooze and whatever
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
of the world which
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
obviously have their own pathways for
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
individual students but everyone's
 
01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.069 align:start position:0%
individual students but everyone's
competing

01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
competing
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
against a dwindling pool as opposed to
 
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
pool our resources together provide a
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
much better product for the student
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
and we're going to go and we're going to
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know market this now each individual
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
the 11 units if you will the 11
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
locations and facilities they still
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
maintain their their locations their
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
identity their brand that's very
 
01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:04.710 align:start position:0%
identity their brand that's very
important

01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
nashville community college has to
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
maintain being nashua community college
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
employment state has to maintain being
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
plymouth state
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
but that's just the entry doorway to a
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
bigger system that broadens
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
folks and the vast majority of students
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
will still stay
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
you know the plymouth state students
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
will still likely take the most of their
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
classes and on options
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
at plymouth state same with unh and
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise but
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
to have that option right that that
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
smooth revolving
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
door from one location to another where
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
you're not reapplying and you're not
 
01:07:31.599 --> 01:07:32.150 align:start position:0%
you're not reapplying and you're not
going

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
through hoops it's a seamless transition
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
where you're just taking another class
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
or you're working with professors from
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
another location the whole
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
system is open to you as a student i
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
think that's an incredibly exciting
 
01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.470 align:start position:0%
think that's an incredibly exciting
thing

01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
to be offering and i don't i got to be
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
honest i don't think it's nearly as hard
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
as people think it is i really don't
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
um you you have much larger entities
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
merging all the time in the united
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
states they might be private entities
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
and whatnot
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
but you have much larger m a uh
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
acquisitions and going on and much
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
much heavier heads butting together as
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
two public systems that know where they
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
are they don't have to redesign they
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
don't have to necessarily rebrand
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
they just need to kind of put the back
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
ends together and create a seamless
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
front end for the students
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a huge leap i know a lot
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
of folks like to think well this is
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
going to take
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
a decade to complete now it's not going
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
to take no no any merger and acquisition
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
that takes more than two and a half to
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
three years to complete
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
was never designed right in the first
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
place so we know this can be done and
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
and again it doesn't mean that we have
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
to give ourselves an end date of one
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
year and then we're
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's done or it's not but really putting
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
i think that framework together allowing
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
the boards and those that are on the
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
front lines of this to have a lot of the
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
input in that as opposed to
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
the governor and the legislature
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
pre-determining and dictating it
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
um the date is there and so again i
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
think the time is right
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
um uh unfortunately what the data says
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
is if we don't move now
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
um we're just going to get further and
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
further down the road we're also at a
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
crossroads of opportunity
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
neither of them have chancellors right
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
now even i think jeremy
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
the the the head of the board over at
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
community colleges is now
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
has indicated that he's going to be
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
moving on so you don't want to bring in
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
chancellors to two systems knowing that
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
you're going to merge the systems
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's a year or three years down
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
the line um
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
and then maybe have to go find another
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
chancellor that works better with this
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
new newly designed system the
 
01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.309 align:start position:0%
new newly designed system the
opportunity

01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
all the stars are kind of lining up to
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
get this done now
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
to look at where the system is going to
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
go you know bring them together
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
um and then you find an individual or a
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
team of individuals
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
that have the right skill sets for that
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
newly designed system
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
right don't bring somebody in um
 
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
i mean bringing somebody in to be a
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
chancellor system is hard enough there's
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
already a transition there
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
you'll be in endless transition i guess
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
is my point uh if you bring them in
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
and then immediately charge you with the
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
task of bringing everything together
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
that that's that's too much to ask of
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
any individual and it's not fair to them
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
or or the systems
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
or or the process that you're trying to
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
set up so so the timing is just really
 
01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:01.189 align:start position:0%
set up so so the timing is just really
really

01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
really good everything is lining up it's
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
a i think it's a bipartisan positive
 
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.390 align:start position:0%
a i think it's a bipartisan positive
effort

01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
effort
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
my only fear is that we slow down
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
frankly um i don't i think you can push
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
it i think we haven't
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
if i didn't have faith in the
 
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
individuals on the board and the
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
individuals that are
 
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
that are managing the community college
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
the individuals that are managing the
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
university we have awesome
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
awesome teams there right now really
 
01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
good teams if i didn't have faith in
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
those individuals i wouldn't be making
 
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:26.950 align:start position:0%
those individuals i wouldn't be making
this

01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
this this push um but we just have the
 
01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.149 align:start position:0%
this this push um but we just have the
right

01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
teams at the right time in the right
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
moment to make this thing happen
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and that's it i mean that's that's
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
kind of where i am i could go on all day
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
as you guys know
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
but um but again i think allowing for
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
that flexibility and not predetermining
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
everything is
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
is actually a real asset to us in
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
allowing those boards to come together
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
we fill it in with skill sets
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
real skill sets uh that would be
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
required in in such an endeavor
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
i think the next year could be really
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
exciting and then we can launch
 
01:10:54.719 --> 01:10:55.270 align:start position:0%
exciting and then we can launch
something

01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
at least the preliminary first phases of
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
it within a year or two i i think you
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
just got to get started now and
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know the stars are aligning let's uh
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
let's seize the opportunity when it's
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
presented to us
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh governor would you mind taking a
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
couple of questions
 
01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:13.270 align:start position:0%
couple of questions
sure

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay so folks uh
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative weiler i see that you
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
have your hand up
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um right now our
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
task is to try to
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
complete a budget and we don't have any
 
01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:31.910 align:start position:0%
complete a budget and we don't have any
forecast

01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
forecast
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to help us whether this is
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
going to be a change is it going to be
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
more money less money and so on and so
 
01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:37.990 align:start position:0%
more money less money and so on and so
forth

01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
forth
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
and the other thing i fear is that
 
01:11:40.719 --> 01:11:41.350 align:start position:0%
and the other thing i fear is that
normally

01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
normally
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
division two has a history of being more
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
generous to the community college
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
than to the unh we provide a higher
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of the
 
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
um budget to the community college
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
because we think it helps more people
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and especially more
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
people that are starting out
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
and can't afford a four-year college so
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
we want to encourage them by giving more
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
money to the community college than we
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
do to the unh
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
because they have far more accessibility
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
to funds and
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth and out-of-state
 
01:12:12.149 --> 01:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
tuition that helps them a little
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
and uh so here's here's the quandary i
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
see immediately
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
um if we gave a batch of money to this
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
combined thing is unh going to take the
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
biggest share
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
or are we still going to be feeling that
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
community college hasn't been
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
left and by by the way we did it before
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
we made sure that we were helping the
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
community college and the students the
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
most needed
 
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
by giving a little more money to the
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
community college and the unh
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
since they had had more uh accessibility
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
to funds and so on and contracts etc
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't need as much so we
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
were giving like i think
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
20 some percent of the budget to the
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
community college and about eight
 
01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:55.910 align:start position:0%
community college and about eight
percent

01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
i see kathy prevention she'd know it to
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
the decimal point
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh what we were giving to unh and uh
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
so my fear is how's the money going to
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
go to this
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
combined sure so let me address that so
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
in my budget i propose basically level
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
funding the university system in the
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
first year
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
right and the community college both of
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
them because they're both going to
 
01:13:17.679 --> 01:13:18.310 align:start position:0%
them because they're both going to
continue

01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
in this next year exactly as is
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
operations have to continue
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
exactly as is nothing is fundamentally
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
changing um that's when the work is
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
really being done
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
you're also bringing in a single you
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
know at some point hopefully within the
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
next year you're
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
you you're defining what this framework
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
of this new entity
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
looks like uh you're bringing in and
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
looking for a chancellor to handle that
 
01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:39.830 align:start position:0%
looking for a chancellor to handle that
entity

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
entity
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
and then in my second year of the budget
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
we look at combining that together now
 
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
again you could keep it separate for at
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
least the next year
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
possibly you know for the second year
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
but i think the opportunity is to bring
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
everything together
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
have the individual chancellor the
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
individual system where you're funding
 
01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.070 align:start position:0%
individual system where you're funding
it

01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
and then it's it's not it's not unh
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
versus national community
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
college anymore it's one singular system
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
with a chancellor that has
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
the op the opportunity to make sure all
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
11 parts are moving
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
right now the left hand and the right
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
hand are really working synergistically
 
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing i would caution is i i
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
have heard some talk of
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
well just as you brought up ken well
 
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
back you know back in the day and you're
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely right the community college
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
always gets a little more favorable
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
treatment on on the financial side
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of talk of yesterday you
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
got them i think everyone has to move on
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
from that
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know i heard people telling me about
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
when i discussed this
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
concept you know talking to me about
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
well mark huddleston
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
mark huddleston that guy's been gone for
 
01:14:38.719 --> 01:14:39.270 align:start position:0%
mark huddleston that guy's been gone for
years

01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
i don't care about mark carlston i don't
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
care about anyone that is not of today
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
because it's all about tomorrow right
 
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
and so i just what i think the
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity is to finally get away from
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
the one system versus another that's
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
exactly what you brought up
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
we should never have one system
 
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
competing against another when they're
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
both public system you have one system
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
a single chancellor and his team working
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
with the the individual presidents and
 
01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
managers of those
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
of of the 11 units if you will i don't
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
know what we want to call them
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
um and saying okay based on the need and
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
the demand here's here's
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
how the money and how you manage it out
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
almost like a business you you really
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
need a ceo
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
more than a chancellor right you need to
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
see this as
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
11 divisions if you will of the same
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
company all providing kind of a
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
different entryway maybe a different uh
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
different specialties
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
but it's really all of the same business
 
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
the same company trying to provide
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
the same opportunity which is the
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
product that's your product right that
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the students
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
so i see as synergizing the systems not
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
only are you
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
you're undoubtedly going to save money
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
right because you just you don't need
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
two i.t systems you don't i mean we
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
if you added up all the back end systems
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
duplicated um it's just in its time it
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
served a purpose but at this point and
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
going forward i think it's archaic
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we should be
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
supporting that that kind of
 
01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:54.550 align:start position:0%
supporting that that kind of
inefficiency

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
inefficiency
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
so you can create massive efficiencies
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
there and it's a one system where you're
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
not competing one against the other
 
01:15:59.679 --> 01:16:00.390 align:start position:0%
not competing one against the other
anymore

01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
um obviously unh is the big dog always
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
has been right and likely it's going to
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
be for quite some time and that provides
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
a huge opportunity for our system
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
but it's not the big dog over everyone
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
else no way
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
it is 11 on par and you need to bring in
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
a team and a chancellor
 
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
that really understand and appreciate
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
that and so what we're doing is
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
i mean let's face it the the
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
inappropriate stigma that is out there
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
is that a community college is somehow
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
second tier it's not
 
01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
that the faculty and the students are
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
second tier they're not
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
they are not and that's what we're
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get away from this whole idea
 
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:36.310 align:start position:0%
trying to get away from this whole idea
that

01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
the community college is somehow second
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
tier to the no way it's one of the best
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
community college systems in the country
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's run so well and creates all this
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
amazing opportunity
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
it is not second tier it's right on par
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
and so that's why i get excited about
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
bringing everyone on to an even level
 
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
under one roof that will be treated as
 
01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:57.189 align:start position:0%
under one roof that will be treated as
equals

01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative bucco you
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
have a quick question
 
01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:04.390 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair and thank you
governor

01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
um so one of the advantages of uh of of
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
the community college is the resilience
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
ability to adapt and in fact in their
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
presentation there today they have
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
three pages of um partnerships with
 
01:17:19.679 --> 01:17:21.189 align:start position:0%
three pages of um partnerships with
employers

01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
and so my concern is will will they
 
01:17:24.159 --> 01:17:24.870 align:start position:0%
and so my concern is will will they
become

01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
will they become one big will be still
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
adapt when it when if or will they
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
become just too big
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
when they merge no i think that i think
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's one of the awesome opportunities
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
the relationships community colleges
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
have with employers and the
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
relationships that the university system
 
01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:43.350 align:start position:0%
relationships that the university system
has

01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
with different employers um there's some
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
crossover there but it tends to be a
 
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
little bit different
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
but again it's all about the students
 
01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:51.750 align:start position:0%
but again it's all about the students
path

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
path
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
right let's say unh has a great
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
partnership with lonza over at pease
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
which is you know the
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical manufacturer and all that
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
sort of thing unh is
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
designing this giant bio life sciences
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity and building they're
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
doubling their
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
number of nursing and all of that so
 
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
they are going to naturally have their
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
group of businesses and not just on a
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
local level but on a national level that
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
they're interacting with doing research
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
with and developing with
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
and so why should the opportunity is now
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
that community that the manchester
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
community college student
 
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
has all that same access right and vice
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
versa the students at unh
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
that maybe aren't into the research and
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
development side but want a little more
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
of a local connection to some of to some
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
of the more mid-sized
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
um more main street real businesses
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturing whatever it might be
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
because the community colleges tend to
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
have much better
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
connections to the manufacturing world
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
and as manufacturing from overseas is
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
coming back into the us and will
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
continue to do so
 
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
over the next few years there's going to
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
be huge opportunities there
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
and as we all know you know
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturing again was
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
kind of had this stigma a few years ago
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
and we're really changing that paradigm
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
so now those students are going to be
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
work through the community college's
 
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
contacts all that all the individual
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
entities those 11 entities still
 
01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:05.430 align:start position:0%
entities those 11 entities still
maintain

01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
their identities their brand their
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
relationships but we're just opening
 
01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:09.350 align:start position:0%
relationships but we're just opening
those

01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh contacts which traditionally are
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
separated now to everybody
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
right you're you're if you are a post
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know you're a higher education
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
student in new hampshire
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
you get the golden ticket to everything
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
we're not siloing you
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
with that market segment or those you
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
know those businesses
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
um we're letting everybody kind of play
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i just think that's a rising tide
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
floats all boats
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh representative
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
whoops thank you governor for taking my
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
um i agree that the
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
number of high school students are
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
reducing drastically across our state
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
but at the same time we're seeing those
 
01:19:56.159 --> 01:19:57.189 align:start position:0%
but at the same time we're seeing those
reductions

01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
we're seeing um a huge increase
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
in the number of young adults of
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
middle age people that are seeking
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
education in different ways um just
 
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
i've worked at snoop during the time
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
they had their big explosion
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
um in terms of their online program and
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
so we're seeing
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
different populations of people coming
 
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.229 align:start position:0%
different populations of people coming
in

01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
my big concern is that when you create
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
a huge system that needs
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
many many different products it gets
 
01:20:32.239 --> 01:20:32.790 align:start position:0%
many many different products it gets
harder

01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
harder
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
for individuals to manipulate the system
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
or to
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
get into the system and i just fear that
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
the special
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
unh for example has its own unique um
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
you know if i'm a high school student
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
i'm getting ready i want to go to unh
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
that that's where i want to go because i
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
want a campus i want to play sports i
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
want to do all these things
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
but you know if i'm 35 years old and
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
i've got two kids
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
um i'm trying to get my um degree my
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
graduate degree
 
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
i'm only looking for those courses and i
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
want to be able to do it if i can online
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
that would be great
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
um how do i do that effectively so i'm
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
just concerned
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
about creating a system that's so huge
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
that all of a sudden we won't have that
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
nimbleness that we see in the community
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
college and we won't have that
 
01:21:20.719 --> 01:21:21.830 align:start position:0%
college and we won't have that
sophistication

01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
sophistication
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
that we see from the university system
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
if you could respond please
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
sure i mean i'll give you a quick
 
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
example i can give you is
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
you know a few years ago this state
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
could even didn't even provide an lpn
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
program for nurses
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
you could have an lna program here you
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
could have the or go to the university
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
and get
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
your rn or go you know or you could even
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
go i think manchester community college
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
had the rn program over there
 
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
so you had all these different programs
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
but we weren't even providing
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
one of the most important certifications
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
that you can get as a nurse
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
and i remember sitting down with a young
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
woman she was getting her
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
through the governor's scholarship
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
program i created she was she was
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
getting her nursing degree at the red
 
01:22:00.719 --> 01:22:01.830 align:start position:0%
getting her nursing degree at the red
cross

01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
cross
 
01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
and it was an l and she was a single mom
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
and she said yeah this was great you
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
know the
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
to your point it was very nimble i could
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
come in i got my l
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
my my lna and i said well that's great
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
what do you want to do she said well
 
01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
i i'd like to become an rn but i can't
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
do it
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
right i can't do it because you gotta
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
that's more of a longer time commitment
 
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
i'm a single mom
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
i don't have we don't have those
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
programs here i said what about an lpn
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
and then we looked into it we quickly
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
realized there was no lpn program
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
the community colleges had gotten rid of
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
it they had refused
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to be nimble right they
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
wanted a system
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
that stayed in their lane right so i had
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
to force the com
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
a couple of the community colleges to
 
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
pick up that lpn program and thank god i
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
did because lpns
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
are what you find in long-term care
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
facilities is it's just a whole nother
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
level of nursing and opportunity and we
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
weren't creating that bridge
 
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
so yes the individual systems it's true
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of smaller systems can be
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
are obviously going to be can you can
 
01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
make the argument they can be more
 
01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.310 align:start position:0%
make the argument they can be more
nimble

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
nimble
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
but they can also be much more limited
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
in what they're offering
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
because you know for for various reasons
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
for economic reasons or whatever
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
but now opening that door up i'm just
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
using the one example of nursing
 
01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
you're providing a whole different
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
pathway for that individual that wants
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
to just take the night classes
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
and get an lpn or wants to just take
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
night classes but still be able to get
 
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
her rn
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
because she's part of a system that has
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
an rn degree program
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
but she can do it with the nimbleness of
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
the community college now
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
right so the it isn't i i don't i
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
i think we we shouldn't be looking at
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
this as look at what we're going to lose
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
i think you look at the the bridges that
 
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
we're gaining
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
and those are bridges that create better
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
career pathways for these students
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
i think you could take that to a i'm
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
going to go back to the example i also
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
gave of
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
somebody who who's uh wants to get in or
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
get their business degree
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
but now they want their business degree
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
um they're in the four-year college but
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know what they want to be in
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
construction they want to be in
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturing there's huge opportunities
 
01:23:59.440 --> 01:23:59.990 align:start position:0%
manufacturing there's huge opportunities
there

01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
but you know what they want to they want
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
to also understand what's happening on
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing floor
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
right how is that car being put together
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
how is that this big piece of digital
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
equipment being put together
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
well now the four-year university system
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't offer those but now they can
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
take that
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
so instead of just entering the
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
workforce with their you know their
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
mba or whatever it is and they're you
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
know the the peter paul school is
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
wonderful for business degrees and all
 
01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:23.830 align:start position:0%
wonderful for business degrees and all
that

01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
now we're merging that the peter the the
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
academics of the peter paul school with
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
the real world
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
that the community college that's
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
nimbleness that didn't exist
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
in the university system previously so
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
we're not taking anything away from the
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
community college system we're just
 
01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:39.350 align:start position:0%
community college system we're just
adding

01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
adding
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
their asset into that base so of course
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
with any m
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
a merger you're gonna have you can you
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
can look at where it's gonna
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
well this might not work here and that
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
might not work there but if you look at
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
strictly from the students point of view
 
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
we're not taking any nimbleness away
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
from the community college system
 
01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
look there's still seven community
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
colleges that are part of one larger
 
01:24:58.239 --> 01:24:58.950 align:start position:0%
colleges that are part of one larger
system

01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
right now they're going to be those
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
seven are now part of a system of
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
kind of a former system of 11 right with
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
a single point
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
and a single marketing a single brand
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know that that i think that that's
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
or i should say a marketing and a brand
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
that kind of lies over those individuals
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
so they're still going to nashville
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
in the nashua i don't know whether you
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
are called national community college i
 
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't know name it whatever you want
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
they're still going through that door
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
but that door once you get through that
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
door it's a much bigger
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
bigger system behind it and and they get
 
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
to build on the opportunities for their
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay i have to i uh no
 
01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
mary let we need okay um i have two more
 
01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:41.830 align:start position:0%
mary let we need okay um i have two more
questions

01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh one from representative petrie and
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
one from representative lin
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh if that's okay governor will true
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative petra you
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
governor for taking the question
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh when i first heard this proposal i
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
was worried about uh
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
losing the advantage of the
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
affordability of the community colleges
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
i mean it's that's probably the
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
community calls are the best kept
 
01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.790 align:start position:0%
community calls are the best kept
secrets

01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
secrets
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
of of this state i mean they and and you
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
can transition on to the uh
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
university system and uh i heard those
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
comments again this morning could you
 
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i heard you commented you didn't
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
really care about the cost
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
but the affordability makes that a
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
very viable situation sure
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
i think the way we charge for higher
 
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
education is
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
also archaic we're doing it the same way
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
we've always done it
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
no one has ever challenged the system to
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
say let's just take the university
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
system and then we'll do the community
 
01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.030 align:start position:0%
system and then we'll do the community
college

01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
college
 
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
well every credit cost x it's thirteen
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
thousand four hundred 472 dollars to go
 
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
to the university system of new
 
01:26:51.679 --> 01:26:52.310 align:start position:0%
to the university system of new
hampshire

01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
right and that's it and then you go in
 
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
and you take your courses and you do
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
your thing
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
and the community college on average is
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
seven thousand dollars per year
 
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
i think there's an opportunity here to
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
basically blow that up
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
and say let's design i'm this is just me
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
thinking that i'm no expert
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
but let's design a menu let's design a i
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
mean not a menu of
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
not everything a la carte of course but
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
a menu that says look
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
there's uh there's a b there's pathway a
 
01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:18.790 align:start position:0%
there's uh there's a b there's pathway a
b

01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
b
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
c and d and a is is you know the
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
cheapest and d
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
is kind of the gold-plated version the
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
most expensive the most immersive
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
with academics and opportunity um but
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
there's some folks that want to
 
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
go kind of open door b and that has a
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
certain number of classes here and a
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
certain amount of
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
of hands on there and a certain amount
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
of research and development there and
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity there
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
i just think there's a huge opportunity
 
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
to re-examine how we charge for
 
01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
for this all this stuff in the first
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
place the community college is an
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
amazing kept secret
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
but also remember it's the second most
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
expensive community college in the
 
01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:52.629 align:start position:0%
expensive community college in the
country

01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
i think we can go cheaper i think you do
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
that by providing
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
more and better options more enticing
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
options there could be pathways that are
 
01:27:59.760 --> 01:27:59.990 align:start position:0%
options there could be pathways that are
more

01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
expensive there could be pathways that
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
are cheaper but
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
i mean it's it's it's it's expensive
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
next to vermont i think vermont's number
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
one and
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
and community in new hampshire is number
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
two in terms of cost i just think
 
01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity by doing this
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
to allow to to get a little more
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%
creative about what we're offering
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
and it isn't just community college will
 
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
cost you x university system will cost
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
you why
 
01:28:23.110 --> 01:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's a two year this is a four year
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
pick your door good luck
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
hope you picked right that's exactly
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to get away from
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
i think by offering more options you
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
just provide more flexibility in that
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
pricing and and again it's it maybe it's
 
01:28:35.199 --> 01:28:35.669 align:start position:0%
pricing and and again it's it maybe it's
not

01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
as immersive of a program maybe it's
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
it's more for
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know single moms that have to you
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
know be at home with the kids a little
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
bit but still want to advance their
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
career or
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
or upskilling opportunities those can be
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit cheaper
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
but not and look maybe maybe at the end
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
of the day you still just go by the
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
course at the end of the day we can't
 
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
figure it out
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
and look we're still going to say if you
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
want this pathway with these courses
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
you're not necessarily losing the cost
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
there or the cost opportunities for
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
those individuals i just think by
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
putting it all together
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
it gives you the the ability to be more
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
to explore the idea
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
look i think even if you don't put them
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
together i think both these systems have
 
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
to get aggressive about understanding
 
01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:14.719 align:start position:0%
how they're what they're charging and
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
what their what what the product is
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
people have to get the value of the
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
product there's a very good
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
value in the community college don't get
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
me wrong but i just think you can do
 
01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:23.430 align:start position:0%
me wrong but i just think you can do
better

01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
and and no one's ever challenged that
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
everyone is just sticking in their lane
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
we'll go to the legislature we'll beg
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
for money we'll compete against the
 
01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:32.229 align:start position:0%
for money we'll compete against the
university

01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
university
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
we'll get what we can we'll adjust our
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
cost variables accordingly
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
we'll do our our faculty contracts
 
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
accordingly and we'll hope that the
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
students keep coming in
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
and and we pray that next year is almost
 
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
as good as it was this year
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
and hopefully hopefully it'll keep
 
01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
working it's not going to keep working
 
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
right because when you're charging 7 000
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
for the community college it's a great
 
01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:56.229 align:start position:0%
for the community college it's a great
product

01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
but you're not charging seven the snooze
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
of the world aren't charging seven
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
thousand for online learning
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
and so that's going to force everyone to
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
do more on the online learning side and
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
pretty soon both systems are going to
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
be competing each other for that that
 
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
lower cost
 
01:30:11.189 --> 01:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
product the lower cost product doesn't
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
just need to be online
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
right it can be a more hands-on more
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
immersive more traditional
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh product but you do that by i think by
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
kind of expanding
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
the opportunities and kind of
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
whiteboarding this thing you know
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
tearing it right down and saying look
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
here's our costs here's where we need to
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
be here's the opportunities we can
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
provide and here's the different tiers
 
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
that that we could immerse within both
 
01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:32.870 align:start position:0%
that that we could immerse within both
systems

01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative lynn
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you governor for taking my
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
question i i guess i should
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
stay at the outset i i really do think
 
01:30:46.629 --> 01:30:46.639 align:start position:0%
that this is an excellent
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
idea i mean i i think that there will be
 
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
at least there should be some cause some
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
significant cost savings in addition to
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
all the other
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
things that you pointed out but i i
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
guess my question is this
 
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
um i i as i understand it the idea would
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
be to appoint this
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
i guess 15 person board that would sort
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
of work out
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
the details and that you know that i'm
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
sure that there are a lot of details to
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
be worked out and that makes sense
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
the one thing i'm wondering is this
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
if you know if if you're committed to
 
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
doing this and
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm glad that you are and they'll
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
and you know assuming that the
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
legislature also
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
signs on to do this um then i wonder if
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't make sense
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
to appoint a a chancellor
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know now or where i say now i mean
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
very soon
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
before the before the one-year period
 
01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
goes by
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
because i guess i'm i'm really sort of
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean to suggest anybody i'm
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
sure everybody will operate in good
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
faith and work
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
you know very hard to to bring this
 
01:31:49.679 --> 01:31:50.950 align:start position:0%
you know very hard to to bring this
about

01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm sort of wondering if if it
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to have somebody
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's kind of
 
01:31:59.669 --> 01:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
in charge from the beginning that can
 
01:31:59.679 --> 01:32:00.470 align:start position:0%
in charge from the beginning that can
say

01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know that can sort of crack the whip
 
01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:04.390 align:start position:0%
you know that can sort of crack the whip
if

01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
if it seems like things are you know
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
people are trying to find reasons to
 
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
sort of not make it happen so that
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
that's my really only only question
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to appoint
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
somebody sooner rather than later yes no
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
your spot on uh representative lin um
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
once i think once we make the
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
commitments the board you know the
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
legislature is on board i guess what uh
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
what i was saying i i i wasn't very
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
clear i don't want them to appoint
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
anyone now before we've decided whether
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
we're go or no
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
right but you're absolutely right you
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
need someone kind of leading the charge
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
not just running the meetings but really
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
keeping the train on the track
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's a giant train the track can go in a
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
lot of ways
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a lot of work to manage
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
this and keep this on board i think
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
you're probably bringing folks from both
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
of the community college
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know the operations side and the
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
university side as well to support
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
an individual maybe you bring in the
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
individual as the new
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
the new the new ceo chancellor whatever
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
you want to call it maybe bringing
 
01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
someone in to say look
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
you're our two two to three year guy or
 
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
girl or woman
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
and and you're the individual that's
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
going to drive this thing and then we'll
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
decide you know you give them like a
 
01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.390 align:start position:0%
decide you know you give them like a
temporary

01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
a shorter term contract to really put
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
this thing together
 
01:33:11.189 --> 01:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
and maybe they're the answer to manage
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
it in the long term maybe they're not
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
maybe you want to bring someone else in
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
but no
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
i think you're spot on as soon as i
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
think that once we can if we can make
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
this commitment
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
and and i'll say we're going to give it
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
our 110 best effort
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
you're right you need a manage someone
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
on the managing side
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh really driving forward on this i
 
01:33:29.110 --> 01:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
someone asked me who that would be i
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
i mean i i can tell you what skill sets
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
i think that person needs but i
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
can tell you i have nobody in mind i
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
have uh no no pre
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
predilections on any of that i'm just
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure we're staying
 
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
can we you know does this make sense and
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
and by the way
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
look i'm not saying what i'm proposing
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know is
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
is the end-all be-all only answer um i
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
think it's the
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
i think what we've really tried to do is
 
01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
provide the best option we have to
 
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
maintain flexibility
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
to let the the boards really design the
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
system i didn't want to come in
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
and pre-determine much of that but i
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
think you're absolutely right i think
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
you do need someone at the helm very
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
early on
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
to keep this process on track to meet
 
01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
the goals and the deadlines that will
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
have to be there
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
if you want to if you want to be
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
successful thank you very much
 
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you governor we
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
so appreciate you spending this last
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
however long with us and uh and i hope
 
01:34:22.239 --> 01:34:22.790 align:start position:0%
however long with us and uh and i hope
that

01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh in some ways that uh
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
you have cleared up some of the
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
questions that
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh that our folks have and um
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
we will uh we'll be working through this
 
01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:37.830 align:start position:0%
we will uh we'll be working through this
somehow

01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
and uh and i really uh i really thank
 
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:41.109 align:start position:0%
and uh and i really uh i really thank
you

01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
for joining us today you bet well look i
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
i just if i may madam chairwoman i i
 
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
can't thank you guys enough
 
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
um i don't do a whole lot of interaction
 
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh with the committees
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh because i kind of for the budget
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
stuff i usually let the legislature have
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
to make those decisions
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh but on this one i think um it is it
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
is a leap
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
it is not a leap of faith but it is a
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
leap to say
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
we're gonna get this thing done and i
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
just i want i i hope folks take it with
 
01:35:05.119 --> 01:35:05.430 align:start position:0%
just i want i i hope folks take it with
the

01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
excitement and opportunity that i see it
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
as um
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
it's easy to say no everybody can say no
 
01:35:11.119 --> 01:35:11.590 align:start position:0%
it's easy to say no everybody can say no
right

01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
but i think there is a whole lot of
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity um
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
and and to have kind of that bipartisan
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
support all hands on deck
 
01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
um it'll be a challenge but i just let's
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
let's have some fun
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
like let's just whiteboard this thing
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
out and see what we can do and
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
and i and i really mean it i know folks
 
01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
get sick and tired of me saying we're
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
the gold standard
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
we kind of are we're the pace setters
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the country
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
in so many areas of what we go after
 
01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's what we're doing with drugs
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
what we're doing
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
with mental health the opportunities
 
01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
we're trying to create in the business
 
01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:40.950 align:start position:0%
we're trying to create in the business
community

01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
and now taking our our our higher
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
education and saying
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
look snoo made a leap of huge faith if
 
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
you will
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
a decade ago 15 years ago and they said
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to go really all in
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
on the online stuff before anybody else
 
01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
and they knocked it out of the park they
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
owned the market
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
on it right um everyone else who was
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
kind of left behind is scrambling
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
let's leave the pack let's lead the pack
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
in the new design for higher education
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
