periodic requests for the
 
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
big yes um and I I know you have all of
 
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
our information so I I would prefer to
 
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
to answer questions um rather than bore
 
00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 align:start position:0%
you with details of things you already
 
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
have in in front of you obviously the
 
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
last uh last year was a difficult one we
 
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
did not um open the building the eastern
 
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
states Exposition did not go forward and
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
we're unsure of what is going to happen
 
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime the uh the building
 
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
continues to uh to needs to be
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
maintained many years ago uh former
 
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner Taylor set up a uh
 
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
organization called uh champions of New
 
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire Farms they
 
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
largely run the um exhibits within the
 
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
building and they they have run uh
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
things like the uh a booth to do lobster
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
macaroni and cheese and and raise funds
 
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
much of the money that they they raise
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
is put right back into the buildings so
 
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of the maintenance is is done that
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
way obviously they raised no money last
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
year so periodically we do need to come
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
forward and ask for um monies for from
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
the state to maintain the building and I
 
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
think pictures and in these cases truly
 
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
do speak a thousand words the the one
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
thing that you really can't tell from
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
the pictures uh is the issue of the fire
 
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
escape while it looks like it's well
 
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
maintained it does not meet current
 
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
codes and we have a dorm room on the top
 
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
floor of the building and that is the
 
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
emergency exit and um while we were
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
largely left alone by Massachusetts when
 
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:30.919 align:start position:0%
it came to build buing codes they have
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
recently started to come down on us we
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
have a number of issues with the dorm
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
room we're not asking for any assistance
 
00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
and dealing with with those but um one
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
of the things we absolutely need is to
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
bring our fire escape um to code and you
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
can see the the other issues with the
 
00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
deterioration of the exterior of the
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
building that we're uh we're dealing
 
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
with so with that I'd be glad to answer
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
any questions commissioner we have a lot
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
of new members
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
on this committee uh if you could just
 
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
take a minute or so to explain why we
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
owed a building in
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
massach fair fair enough so um the
 
00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
eastern states Exposition is really a
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
one of a kind in in the country it is a
 
00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
fair run by all New England states
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
through a non nonprofit which um all
 
00:08:29.469 --> 00:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
states have trustees that uh are respons
 
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
responsible for that and over a period
 
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
of time beginning in the 1920s each New
 
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
England State built a building to
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
represent their state and have exhibits
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
within those those buildings and they're
 
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
all in a in a row they're beautiful
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
buildings and um we showcase New
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire products in those buildings so
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
um you have some of that in your
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
materials but um for many of our vendors
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's a huge part of their annual income
 
00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
because there's a million five people
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
coming through the fair now uh each each
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
year and um it's really a a
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
great time for for everyone but it's a
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
huge uh fundraiser and this is is
 
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
something we should be proud of and we
 
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
should maintain our building and and
 
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
right now we're not doing a very good
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
job of that obviously the building is
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
now over 90 years old and um has has
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
been fairly wellmaintained but you can
 
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
really see the deterioration of the of
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
the pointing and the chimneys are are
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
leaning and need to be brought down and
 
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
and built up up again but
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
um it is it is a a unique event in the
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
country and it it
 
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
um the the I remember my first term that
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
was my basic question of why are we
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
spending money in
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh hopefully that will do
 
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
it um is the the dollar
 
00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:05.959 align:start position:0%
amount within the
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
um um Governor's proposal and what is it
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
will be in House Bill 25 sufficient to
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
do those repairs that you talked about
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
we we believe that it is um you know
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
prices prices change but um we do
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
believe that we will be able to um to do
 
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
that and there are a couple of lower
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
priced items items here that if perhaps
 
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:32.839 align:start position:0%
there isn't we might still have the
 
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
ability to work with the champions of
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Farms to get these these
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
things done um I can't guarantee that
 
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
but we we believe this will will
 
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
accomplish our
 
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
goals any questions of
 
00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
um the um commissioner or his staff
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
about uh this uh project that is
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
included in hospital
 
00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
25 representative
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
eil thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner um could you talk about the
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
faux chimneys I I gather they're part of
 
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
the stylistic uh appearance of the
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
building and that's why they have to be
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
replaced yes they are um you know I I
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
don't know a lot of of the history as
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
you can see the building was built to be
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
a replica of the original state house um
 
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
and I assume that that is part of it and
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
certainly removing those would
 
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
substantially change the the look of of
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
the building and so I would certainly
 
00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
not recommend removing them and not
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
replacing them I think it would it would
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
be a real detriment to the to the
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
you um representative Newman yes thank
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
you commissioner
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
do you have an estimate of what the fire
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
escape repairs alone would
 
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
be uh yes that's
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
you representative AB yes thank you Mr
 
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
chairman commissioner I would assume
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
that the the fire escape would be the
 
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.240 align:start position:0%
number one
 
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
priority is that yeah I I think it
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
probably is
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
um Gail might be able
 
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:36.519 align:start position:0%
to um speak to that although you know I
 
00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
I think it will be some years before
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
those chimneys might be in danger of
 
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:42.519 align:start position:0%
toppling over you you can see that those
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
could become a safety uh a safety
 
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
concern because they are are leaning and
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
um at some
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
point that could be a safety concern but
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
I think without the uh fire escape being
 
00:12:58.189 --> 00:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
brought up to code we would be in danger
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
of not being able to have the workers
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
stay there um and that is a a huge part
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
of of how we are able to operate the
 
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
building is to use that bunk room and
 
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:12.519 align:start position:0%
have those the people who come in and
 
00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
are permanent workers really working for
 
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
the champions of New Hampshire Farms to
 
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
be able to uh to stay there overnight
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
because obviously wouldn't be able to
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
afford that if we had to put people up
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
any other questions of the commissioner
 
00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
or his staff Mr chairman uh
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative CL thank you and I'm
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner and I know that the
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
chairman alluded to this about because
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
periodically the agriculture Department
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
comes in with a requests for this
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
building do you remember when the last
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
capital budget there was a request for
 
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
this building and you have any idea what
 
00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
it was for it's a brief description and
 
00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
if not like maybe someone on the staff
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
but I I think Gail could probably answer
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
that I don't believe that we had
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
requested anything in my first budget so
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
I I will defer to Gail on that okay
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
right thank youer yes good morning um I
 
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
believe it was under commissioner Merill
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
so probably 10 or so years ago and I
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
believe the main request was for roof
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
repair to the
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
building all right thank you appreciate
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
that information
 
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately I remember that far
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
back any other questions of the
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
some of you know is the New Hampshire
 
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
Branch's singular and comprehensive
 
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
Technology Innovation program we will
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
explain why to those who uh don't
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
already know why it is essential to New
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens to share with you uh
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
our successes we will explain how we
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
will strategically utilize Capital funds
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming bium our
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
presentations uh after our presentation
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
we're prepared to answer uh any
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
questions the branch is requesting $1.4
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
million of capital funds to continue the
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
ecort project it's a technical program
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
that reduces procedural barriers and
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
increases access to Justice through
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
Modern software and Hardware examples
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
include electronic filing for attorneys
 
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
and self-represented litigants online
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
access to case documents automated
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
workflow for staff and attorneys and
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
judges managing mostly the paperless
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
court that we now find ourselves in
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
never has the properly applied use of
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
Technology proven to be more beneficial
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire citizens than during
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and we can provide examples
 
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
of that our presentation will
 
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that value the know
 
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
historically the New Hampshire in court
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
project began in 2012 uh I was there so
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
I have a memory of it every year since
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire judicial branch has
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
delivered Technology Solutions on time
 
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:48.039 align:start position:0%
and on budget the program has been
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
recognized nationally as a model for
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
supporting self-represented litigants in
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
their transition from paper to paperless
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
firing most importantly we will share
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
datadriven metrics that demonstrate New
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire e-c Court's value to litigants
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
and other
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
parties as with any technology New
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ecourt continues to evolve our
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
objective is to continue advancing as
 
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
rapidly as new and better Solutions
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
become available your support through a
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
capital appropriation has always been
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
appreciated and it will yet again enable
 
00:18:24.149 --> 00:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Branch to keep modern
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
technology in our access to Justice
 
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
toolkit and if there are no other the
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
questions specific questions of me at
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
this time I will turn over the mic to
 
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
Jackie Waters the New Hampshire ecourt
 
00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.430 align:start position:0%
Jackie Waters the New Hampshire ecourt

program
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
director I would ask the committee to
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
hold all of your questions so we've
 
00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:44.919 align:start position:0%
heard the entire presentation we
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
probably go little
 
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
SM thank you

this opportunity again my name is Jackie
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
Waters the New Hampshire ecort program
 
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
director and I have been working on New
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ecort since the beginning in
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
2012 as Justice 6 mentioned we're
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
requesting $1.4 million to expand eort
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
following the NH Court 2.0 strategic
 
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
plan this is a plan focused um on areas
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
of continuous Improvement to complete
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
some strategic initiatives that improve
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
access to Justice and to build out the
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
technical infrastru structure that
 
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
supports the modern technology required
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
by government
 
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
entities I'm I'm following along on the
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
slides I assume that you've all received
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
them that I've just covered on the
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
slide excuse me I just get my computer
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
to work okay so what is the purpose of
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire EC Court um you know why
 
00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
do we even do this so really as you can
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
see in the New Hampshire digal Branch
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
Mission we believe in access to justice
 
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
for all and the New Hampshire EC cor
 
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
program exists so that modern technology
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
can facilitate this Mission we believe
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
that the prudent use of technology to
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
ensure the court system remains a viable
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
and relevant dispute resolution form
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
independently moving to the next
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
slide so how does the New Hampshire
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
ecourt help people during the pandemic
 
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
we couldn't of course have this
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
presentation without this mentioning the
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
pandemic um I feel believe that it they
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
this situation offers an actually unique
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to demonstrate how ecourt
 
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
supports the judicial branches Mission
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
even during these most challenging times
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
so for example electronic filing means
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
people do not need to come into the
 
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
courthouse to conduct their Court
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
business fewer visitors means more
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
effective social distancing and lowers
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
covid-19 exposure risk and also two
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
court operations are not not at this
 
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
time tightly bound to court facilities
 
00:21:06.909 --> 00:21:06.919 align:start position:0%
so remote working and remote hearings
 
00:21:06.919 --> 00:21:08.350 align:start position:0%
so remote working and remote hearings
are

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
possible and calling your attention to
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
some of the data points uh since the
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic in the Superior Court nearly
 
00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
11,000 cases have been e filed and
 
00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:21.559 align:start position:0%
almost 24,000 cases in the Circuit
 
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
Court I think it's important to know
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
about remote working um when they uh uh
 
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
Court process is electronic you can more
 
00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:33.799 align:start position:0%
easily reallocate staff and judges when
 
00:21:35.789 --> 00:21:35.799 align:start position:0%
quarantine and illness impact our
 
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
staffing levels so reallocating work
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
among the staff has been a great benefit
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
ecort so slide number four what is eort
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
some of you may not be as familiar with
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh the program as others I think of it
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
in three in three categories it's first
 
00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
it's a technology platform this platform
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
automates adjudication processes that
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
are administered by the judicial
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
branch it is also a set of
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
software-based services these include
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
electronic filing and electronic service
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
online document access for case parties
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
and others and it also includes guided
 
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
interviews to help self-represented
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
litigant to prepare their pleadings
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
you've heard of um turbo court or turbox
 
00:22:24.269 --> 00:22:24.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's similar to that and
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
answering questions um results in a
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
properly formatted ple in for electronic
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
filing and finally eort is also a
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
strategic management approach we focus
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
on providing substantial benefits by
 
00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
optimizing our resources and one that I
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
refer to as the small But Mighty team
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
and rather deploying deploying just
 
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
disperate point Solutions so our goal is
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the whole is greater than
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
technology some people like pictures so
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
I decided to put a conceptual diagram of
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
ecort uh into their presentation and
 
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
very briefly um this is an idea that uh
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
looking on the left side of the diagram
 
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
of course eort is internet based what
 
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
isn't these days we have our
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
constituents our self- represent Lans
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
attorneys Justice Partners um we also
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
have vendors M much of our ecort
 
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
technology platform is hosted in the
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
government Cloud the S secure government
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
cloud and um if they questions about
 
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure we can Mac and answer them
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
for you the um middle it's always the
 
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
security layer right cyber security um
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
General Network traffic making sure it's
 
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
safe and secure and then on the other
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
side of that secure wall is are are the
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
staff and the judges who are working
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
every day um and in the gray box on the
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
very far right side those represent our
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
Enterprise systems the aicy case
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
management system product called judge
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
judge Judges Bench uh which is for hand
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
L documents during um hearings and then
 
00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:03.799 align:start position:0%
finally case party access to their uh
 
00:24:03.799 --> 00:24:08.630 align:start position:0%
finally case party access to their uh
file

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
documents so what are the benefits of an
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
electronic Court in EC
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
specifically so you can see there's some
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
of the some of the benefits I've listed
 
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
um so every every initiative that we
 
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
Implement is with with is excuse me is
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
with the intent to consistently deliver
 
00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
and improve upon the solutions that
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
makes to judicial branch more effective
 
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
in its critical
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
role we Endeavor to remove physical and
 
00:24:34.919 --> 00:24:36.710 align:start position:0%
role we Endeavor to remove physical and
process

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
barriers our solution should build trust
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
in in our systems over time it should
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
support and litigant engagement to
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
ensure Fair
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
outcomes and they provide a level of
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
transparency that's required under law
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
and finally we Endeavor to maximize the
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
available resources in the judicial
 
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.630 align:start position:0%
available resources in the judicial
branch

00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
so eort by the numbers um I'm very proud
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
to say and and the team that I work with
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
has delivered a successful project on
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
time and every on budget every year
 
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.789 align:start position:0%
time and every on budget every year
since

00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:14.919 align:start position:0%
2012 over 136,000 cases have been filed
 
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
representing about 1.8 million
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
documents and again we've completed
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
about 13 projects virtually one every
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
2012 so we've used the generous funding
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
that we we have received prudently and
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
effectively for eight years we have
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
never had a failed
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
project an important metric that many
 
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
look at when they're talking about court
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
operations this is a time to disposition
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
so we have some preco numbers there and
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
we have some data that show an 8 to 72%
 
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
decrease in the time to
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
disposition uh for several of the
 
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
types I also wanted to call out 1.8
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
million uh electronic documents I
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
decided to do sort of a backof the
 
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
envelope calculation on that so that's
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
millions of sheets of paper not
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
purchased not printed mailed filed
 
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
landfills so the ecort has helped during
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
the courts during the pandemic but of
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
course ecourt was impacted by the
 
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic and we responded in in a manner
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
that I refer to as the pandemic pivot so
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
the projects we had intended for fiscal
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
year 2021 are on hold at the
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
moment that said with a significant in
 
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
fact I would say driving support from
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
the IT department projects were
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
delivered uh or are in progress in
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
response to the emergency orders that Co
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
um presented to us we created a mobile
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
Workforce by substantially improving our
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
virtual private Network and we allocated
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
laptops and related Hardware to staff
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
and judges who did not have them we also
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
launched virtual court so we introduced
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
WebEx providing software and training to
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys judges Court staff filers and
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
we're in the process of building what we
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
call WebEx mobile units these are
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
purpose-built devices that enable video
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
conferencing with
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
ease uh so far there are we have spent
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
more than 12,000 hours on video
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
conferencing and we've that has is
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
involved over 77,000
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
participants so the courts continue to
 
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
op operate in part uh because the core
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
cases uh I just also wanted to comment I
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
um that the uh additional Hardware
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
required was funded with the coronavirus
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
act so why does the New Hampshire eor
 
00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:57.519 align:start position:0%
program require additional Capital funds
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
well as I've mentioned and shown in my
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
picture that there ecort is
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and infrastructure
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
requires maintenance it requires uh to
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
be added new
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
capabilities and it needs to evolve as
 
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
technology involves I Envision it very
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
much as a technology as a tangible asset
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
and failure to invest in technology
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
creates something we refer to as
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
technology debt a status quo in
 
00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
technology actually means moving
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
backward and if you want to catch up and
 
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
move forward trying to get pasture being
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
technically obsolete you have to pay
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
what's called technical debt so future
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
technology expenditures are always more
 
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
costly uh to remedy obsolescent so
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
critical moving on to slide 10 how would
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
we invest the $1.4 million should you
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
approve its
 
00:28:53.389 --> 00:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
appropriation well we have a three-point
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
plan it's a multi-year plan and the
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
first two require the capital funding
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
new software solutions for example to
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
help uh litigants understand legal
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
issues to help them pay fines to access
 
00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:08.919 align:start position:0%
Court case information more securely and
 
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
conveniently to find ways to settle
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
disputes fairly with greater ease and
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
less time and to reduce tangible
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
expenses we also uh require funding to
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
prepare for the future now in a future
 
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:24.039 align:start position:0%
by anym our intent is to procure a more
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
modern and flexible cases management
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
system that type of Endeavor re requires
 
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
preparation and we would like to do that
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919 align:start position:0%
23 then we also have a third component
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
of the plan of the plan worthy
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
mentioning um we we have to maintain our
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
systems that's not a capital expenditure
 
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
but maintaining systems is a critical
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
plan and finally this isn't um the last
 
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
picture it's a little bit updated from
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
the first one and you can see it looks
 
00:29:59.509 --> 00:29:59.519 align:start position:0%
very much much the same we have our
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
constituents our litigant and our
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
Justice Partners but we also have
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
expanded our our presence in the
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
government cloud and uh we intend um to
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
have more solutions hosted by our
 
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
vendors in this secure environment and
 
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
on the side where we have our uh
 
00:30:20.509 --> 00:30:20.519 align:start position:0%
internal staff working we um are
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
deploying what we call an Enterprise
 
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
service bus and this is a technology
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
that helps um move information and
 
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:30.200 align:start position:0%
workflows more uh fluidly and more
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
rapidly than using many many separate um
 
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.029 align:start position:0%
rapidly than using many many separate um
software

00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
software
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
applications so we um believe that we
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
have a proven track record of success
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
and have demonstrated proper stewardship
 
00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:47.559 align:start position:0%
of the resources We Touch people's lives
 
00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
every single day in ways that make a
 
00:30:51.509 --> 00:30:51.519 align:start position:0%
challenging time in people's lives a
 
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
little bit easier and we believe and we
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
know that modern technology is is a
 
00:30:59.549 --> 00:30:59.559 align:start position:0%
modern government is is not a luxury um
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
it's an actually essential service now
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
and the only technology resources
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
available to the digital branch is the
 
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
capital funding that we
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
receive and so thank you for this
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity to tell you our cour story
 
00:31:16.029 --> 00:31:16.039 align:start position:0%
um there are details in the appendix
 
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.519 align:start position:0%
that I encourage you to review and at
 
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:21.559 align:start position:0%
this time um we're taking any questions
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
and um I will facilitate um if I cannot
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
answer the colleagues here surely can
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
um questions uh representative
 
00:31:38.669 --> 00:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
bunker hi Miss Waters um thank you for
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm new to the
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
committee so um forgive me if I make
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
stupid assumptions or anything um I am
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
curious um and I realize covid may make
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
this more complicated too but pre
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic what percentage approximately
 
00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
of total court case load is now handled
 
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
by eort and how is that trending over
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
time and is there some sort of Maximum
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
reach that's a that's an excellent
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
question so um as of
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
2020 100% of the sup Supreme Court and
 
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
100% of the excuse me Superior Court
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
cases are e filed with some exceptions
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
there are some exceptions um we allow an
 
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
an exception for people who are unable
 
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
to to electronically file the circuit
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
courts a bit less than that we have some
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
of the larger case types to complete for
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
E filing these are the case types
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
involving Family Matters juvenile
 
00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:44.919 align:start position:0%
matters and so forth the most
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
confidential and highly sensitive Court
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
matters are not yet e filing if I had to
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
uh roughly estimate I'd say about a
 
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
third of the circuit court cases are
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
electronically filed but I if a precise
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
number is of of critical importance of
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
course I can get that for
 
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you no just curiosity
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair uh yes um so is the is
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
the eventual goal to have 100% eiling
 
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
for all types of cases as or as close as
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
possible yes I would say the eventual
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
goal is to do that um right now our
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
Ambitions are further ahead than the
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
technology available to us again men in
 
00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
that security um but yes it would be the
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
intention of nearly 100 I don't want to
 
00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:35.799 align:start position:0%
say um 100% there are probably some
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
matters that just do not even lend
 
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
themselves to electronic
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
filing thank
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.070 --> 00:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
yeah there we go thank you uh say full
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
disclosure I'm a frequent user of the E
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
file and can attest to its benefits I
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
also appreciates your differentiation
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
between investment and ongoing
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance that's another issue that
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
we've often uh dealt with and I
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate your understanding
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
that Capital Investments can't just be a
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
replacement for ongoing
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance follow on you have an
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
estimate of how long this particular
 
00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:29.720 align:start position:0%
particular investment might what what's
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
the economic lifetime of this investment
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
and when and will we expect to have a
 
00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
major new investment program sometime in
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
the future or is this uh we're trying to
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
relate our
 
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
investment to the uh Bond the length of
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%
time that we have bonds outstanding and
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
I just was wondering whether this is
 
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
like a 10 year or 20y year economic
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
life um
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
I I feel like I have only a Layman's
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
answer to that question I don't know if
 
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
Donna could answer or Matthew could
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
answer from the from my um fiscal
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
perspective or technology perspective I
 
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
can't answer the quick question about um
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
the uh future investment um we we're
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
strongly advocating for replacement of
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
our case management system and we can go
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
into much more detail about that I don't
 
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
have any details today to share with you
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
about but that would be um a a
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
significant um a more significant
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
investment than perhaps we've made in
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
request for in the past but that's a
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
several years at least three or four
 
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.910 align:start position:0%
several years at least three or four
years

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
out um anyone to answer about the
 
00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.270 align:start position:0%
out um anyone to answer about the
economic

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
economic
 
00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.950 align:start position:0%
economic
lifetime

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
lifetime
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
um Matt
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
Donna M sh your sh your crystal ball
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
with us um yes uh representative fauler
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh hi Matthew seeden uh the judicial
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
branch CIO um you know some of these
 
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
are very large institutional
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
applications and I would say you're
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
typically looking at a lifespan of about
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
15 years um a good example is our
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
current case management system since
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
procurement to the possible replacement
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh in the future possibly
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
2024 um it it will have we've had been
 
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
with that product for about 15 years um
 
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
and not just in government but if you
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
look in the private sector large
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
investments into Enterprise you know
 
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
resource planning systems um they
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
typically have a lifespan about 15 years
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
before you look at a new major
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
investment in replacing that you of
 
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
course during that time we're constantly
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
taking new releases bug fixes patches um
 
00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.079 align:start position:0%
but yeah at a certain point you have to
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
replace the entire platform um so I
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
would say for large software Investments
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
you're looking at about 15 years
 
00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:02.599 align:start position:0%
um Hardware much different story um you
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
know software really drives the
 
00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
innovation of Hardware uh and not vice
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
versa Hardware ends up you know
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
depending on what type of device it is
 
00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
you could have Hardware such as cell
 
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
phones and tablets you know honestly
 
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
those are like on a two-year replacement
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
cycle um it's almost the smaller the
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
device the more often you have to
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
replace it then you get into laptops
 
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
they usually have a four to five year
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
useful lifespan desktop computers 6 to S
 
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.710 align:start position:0%
useful lifespan desktop computers 6 to S
years

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
servers um you know the back end of
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure slightly longer again
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
probably you know between six and eight
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
years Network networking equipment about
 
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
the same you have a useful lifespan
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
about seven years on those so in this
 
00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
case most the vast majority of this
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
request is going to software so if
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
you're trying to put an economic you
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
know um impact on it as far as the
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
length of time I would estimate about 15
 
00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:57.950 align:start position:0%
length of time I would estimate about 15
years

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
um 10 to 15 is probably the appropriate
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
I would not go over
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
15 thank you for that
 
00:38:08.309 --> 00:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
answer thank you any other questions I
 
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
do have
 
00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.870 align:start position:0%
do have
one

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh understanding that you're are a
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
separate branch of government has this
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
um system been coordinated with the
 
00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
State's Department of Information
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
Technology to make sure that we're all
 
00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
doing short answer is yes but I think
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
Matt uh thank you for the question um
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
yeah we do have Integrations where we do
 
00:38:52.109 --> 00:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
share information electronically with um
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety um you
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
know are our systems exact ly the same
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
no they're they're using a completely
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
different record management system than
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
we are but through the we call it the J1
 
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
switch um which is basically a an API or
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
an integration layer we can send and
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
receive data between our two systems um
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
you know the judicial branch it is we're
 
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
I like to think of us as extremely very
 
00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:22.599 align:start position:0%
good neighbors with doit we participate
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
in um their cyber security uh advisory
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
committee we're members of the kick um I
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
have regular monthly meetings with
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner goule um so we're very much
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
partners and we do discuss regularly
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
what both uh the executive branch it is
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
working on in the judicial branch we
 
00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
want to ensure that our we have the
 
00:39:47.309 --> 00:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
capabilities to partner with each other
 
00:39:47.319 --> 00:39:48.870 align:start position:0%
capabilities to partner with each other
whenn

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
whenn
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you um like I said I
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
did understand that you're a separate
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
Branch but it does help if we could talk
 
00:39:58.109 --> 00:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
between the three branches of government
 
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
and we do so yes representative evil you
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
have your hand
 
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
up I actually had exactly the same
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
question about coordination among the
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
diff uh with with doit so thank you
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
questions yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
um you sp you spoke at length about the
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
the effect of the pandemic on the ecort
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
and one of the things and the bullet
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
points you have is about eiling for
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect chins petitions
 
00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:44.839 align:start position:0%
Juvenile and adoption cases um I I
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
certainly would think that given the
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
trend that
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh because of the reporting agencies
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
that the number um of these cases would
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
have declined during the pandemic and
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
once we resemble or resume The New
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
Normal that you
 
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
would be be seeing a significant
 
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
increase is that correct or am I
 
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
wrong um that's an excellent question
 
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
one that doesn't fall into my area of
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
expertise um who who um Justice hick do
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
you have any thoughts about abuse
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
neglect um volume just to to start out
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
with um those are the least Pleasant
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
cases in our system as you no doubt can
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate um and we FastTrack every one
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
of them uh the legislature has supported
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
us in that endeavor in the past um we
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
don't have any hard statistics from
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
which to extrapolate what an increase
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
might be but we certainly know
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that they are down and they
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
are likely in fact to go up so I think
 
00:41:58.589 --> 00:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
you're right on Target that we will
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
receive an increase in that type of case
 
00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.550 align:start position:0%
receive an increase in that type of case
and

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
litigation representative
 
00:42:11.069 --> 00:42:11.079 align:start position:0%
Thomas yes um Justice H uh I have a
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
couple of questions um what point do you
 
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
think that you'll be phasing back into
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
inperson or is this just the future of
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
the CT system um that very good question
 
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
we've learned a lot of benefits uh from
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
this type of operation there are lawyers
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
who appear before us from all around the
 
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
country who are very happy that they
 
00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
don't have to charge their client to get
 
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
on an airplane and fly 2,000 miles to
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
appear before our court I I'm going to
 
00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
be around here for two and a half more
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
years so I'm probably going to be the
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
one involved in that decision and uh we
 
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079 align:start position:0%
we think our current thinking is keep in
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
mind that uh Chief McDonald has started
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
yet and he's going to be the boss our
 
00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:03.319 align:start position:0%
current thinking is that if parties want
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
to go remotely and agree to go remotely
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
that we continue to go remotely now I
 
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
did happen to speak to Gordon yesterday
 
00:43:16.589 --> 00:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
and he U expressed a strong preference
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
for resuming in-person operations as
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
soon as we can so I guess I've just
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
given you two different answers to that
 
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
question well thank you very much for
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
the answer um I guess follow follow up
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
please Mr chairman
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
um if that's the way it probably will
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
run what would you
 
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
foresee would you foresee there being
 
00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
two separate systems operating at the
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
same time an online system with yes I
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
do yes I do I don't think we can go back
 
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
I mean um there are huge benefits to the
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
system that you and I are engaged in
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
right now for example when we have bar
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
admission ceremonies or award Ceremonies
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
for Lifetime employees uh friends and
 
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
relatives can view from Alaska and
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
California uh and otherwise participate
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
and we get a lot of very positive
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
feedback it's been a very I think uh
 
00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:19.720 align:start position:0%
Chris keading was the one who first
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
noticed it it's been uh a very positive
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh employee relations tool for us um so
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
I think it's not that there's two
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
different systems there's two parallel
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
systems thank you very much thank you
 
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
questions from members of the
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
committee I do have one and it has
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this presentation it
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
has to do with one of your Associates
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
came in previously and talked about
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
digitizing the Supreme Court Records if
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
we were to find the money to do that
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
should we give it to the judicial branch
 
00:45:04.549 --> 00:45:04.559 align:start position:0%
or to somebody else nobody else nobody
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
else seems to want want to take this on
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
as a project well I I I wish whoever
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
does take it on well because in my
 
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
experience it's very very difficult to
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
stop the Justice Bobby Hunt's Marone
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
train once it gets
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
started it really it really is not a
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
court project per se but an archive
 
00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
project um there's history in those uh
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
volumes that um is invaluable and uh I
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
know that she wishes she were here to
 
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:36.790 align:start position:0%
know that she wishes she were here to
speak

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
independently uh about that project but
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh she does not want it to detract from
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
the Court's capital budget request have
 
00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
I answered that anywhere near satisfact
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes you did uh justice Hicks and it
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be at the detriment of what
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
you're asking it would be if we could
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
find money to to even start
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
as a separate project um we just need
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
somebody to be in charge of it if we do
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
that but we will ask the Secretary of
 
00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
State in the archives on their opinion
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
at some point but thank that
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
answer great thank you other questions
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
from members of the
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
committee you have anything further
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
you'd like to add uh justice hick just
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
to thank just to thank you uh as I
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
whenever I get an opportunity to address
 
00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:29.079 align:start position:0%
you to thank you for uh the support of
 
00:46:31.549 --> 00:46:31.559 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch uh I know we're
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
separate branches but the Constitution
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
also says we do have to play well in the
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
sandbox together and I'm pleased that
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
during my tenure here at least uh I've
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
really treasured the relationship
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
between the legislative executive and
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
judicial branches and U we we are here
 
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions you can call any
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
one of us I think you already know where
 
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
you'll get the sophisticated answers
 
00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
versus the UNS sophisticated answers uh
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
but don't hesitate to call us at any
 
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
time and I thank you for
 
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
appearing enjoy your
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
day we will thank you again thank
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
you the next presentation is from the
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and I see that
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
the commissioner is already online with
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
us welcome to Public Works and highways
 
00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:25.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner H good morning and um I
 
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
have a relatively short capital budget
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
for you uh today so I can share my
 
00:47:32.109 --> 00:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
screen if that's necessary but if anyone
 
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
if everyone has the information might be
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
easy just follow along there are two
 
00:47:38.829 --> 00:47:38.839 align:start position:0%
projects um and as well I just send my
 
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
regards uh Tammy Valen Court our Chief
 
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer had intended to be
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
here but she had something that happened
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
this morning that required her otherwise
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
to not be able to join us um so she
 
00:47:52.829 --> 00:47:52.839 align:start position:0%
sends her regards so the first item that
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
we have before you is a capital project
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
for a generator
 
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
um and this is over in uh our uh the
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
building off of Pleasant Street um this
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
is going to be federally funded uh the
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
we we do work over there for the Social
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
Security Administration through our SSDI
 
00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
program um and the federal uh our
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
federal Partners in Washington have
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
asked that we have a generator um backup
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
system for the work that we're doing
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
over there uh they are willing to pay
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
for it and so we have gone to
 
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
uh Das and asked for uh them to scope
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
this out and so here is the proposal
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
that we have uh to install that
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
generator backup system um I can tell
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
you that this is a generator backup
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
system that would accommodate the
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
activities that we have which are on the
 
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
third floor of that facility uh it won't
 
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
be for the whole building I believe it
 
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:49.799 align:start position:0%
would be more if the whole building was
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
covered the the feds are not willing to
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
pay for the whole building they're
 
00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
willing to pay for uh the activities
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
that um that we are performing for them
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
if the uh you know the committee
 
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
believed that it was necessary to have a
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
backup generator for the whole building
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
that would be an additional
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
appropriation that this committee would
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
need to make so that we can at least
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
meet Our obligation to the feds um but
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
that as well uh you know if you thought
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
it was important while we're already
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
doing the work on the generator to just
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
get a bigger one that supports the whole
 
00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
building that would be a decision for
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
the committee to take a look at
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner if I may just ask a
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
question if we work with admin Services
 
00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
about looking at doing a big one will
 
00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
the federal money still be there for
 
00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:37.349 align:start position:0%
the federal money still be there for
inart

00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
inart
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
payment do you know it would be yep so
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
we would be able to proportionally
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
contribute to that the extent that that
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
would support um you know our operations
 
00:49:52.109 --> 00:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
you um the next project that I wanted to
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
bring your attention to
 
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
is um my project leadway which is really
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
my pre-engineering technology so these
 
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
are funds that are used every year to
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
procure um engineering kits and
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
Engineering supplies for a very specific
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
engineering program that we have in uh
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
our schools called project bead the way
 
00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:21.319 align:start position:0%
um and it is a sequential uh program
 
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
that leads students through uh various
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
and increasing sophisticated levels of
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
um engineering project work it has been
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
very successful in the past um and is
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
actually a program that's quite popular
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
with a number of different students um
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the uh the educational system
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
so that's what this project um is used
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
for um commissioner again I've been here
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
a while this dollar amount for the pre
 
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
pre-engineering technology has stayed
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
relatively constant for a couple of
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
decades um is the 300,000 that you are
 
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
asking for sufficient to meet the needs
 
00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:11.079 align:start position:0%
of our students who are involved in this
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
program for the coming
 
00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
bium it it is and I think even in some
 
00:51:18.789 --> 00:51:18.799 align:start position:0%
previous bium we have not used a full
 
00:51:22.109 --> 00:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
allocation of it um but this is adequate
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
to support the project leadway programs
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
that we have and we don't anticipate um
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
you know they're used in many of the
 
00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
schools already but we don't anticipate
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
that there'll be a significant increase
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
that we would need and we think that
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
this will support
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
that thank you for members of the
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee if you've been following along
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
with what the governor proposed as his
 
00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
budget director mentioned when he was
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
here the Hudson CTE Center was funded a
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
year ago um in a separate bill so it
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
will not appear in House Bill 25 so the
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner will not be addressing that
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
particular item if I might address two
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
other projects I wanted I want to talk a
 
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
little bit about CTE projects in
 
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
addition um to one other project if I
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
may so you'll notice what is a
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
conspicuously absent from this budget is
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
a renovation for one of our CTE centers
 
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
um as you know we have a prioritized
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
list um of centers that uh are
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
refurbished on a regular basis as you
 
00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:29.559 align:start position:0%
pointed out we just finished up the
 
00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
funding for the Hudson uh CTE Center um
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
the next projects that are in the queue
 
00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
have been uh Whitefield uh is one of the
 
00:52:44.349 --> 00:52:44.359 align:start position:0%
projects um Whitefield has had several
 
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
um attempts locally to get their local
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
funding for this um I think they've had
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
two or three attempts at that uh they
 
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
have another one that they have put
 
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
together that they're going to be
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
bringing forward uh to their local
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
voters um it is a project again because
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
it's been in the works for a while that
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
they believe that they have scoped the
 
00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
project such that they can get local
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
community support um but they don't have
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
that in this bium and therefore you
 
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
don't see it in this particular uh
 
00:53:14.349 --> 00:53:14.359 align:start position:0%
budget request to you uh the other is
 
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
Claremont who ordinarily would have been
 
00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
scheduled to be able to be refurbished
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
dur as well during this period of time
 
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
um and Claremont as well deferred the
 
00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:26.799 align:start position:0%
process um with the intention of
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
combining with Newport which is one of
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
the next projects that is up in the
 
00:53:33.789 --> 00:53:33.799 align:start position:0%
queue um and to do a combined
 
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity there um potentially a
 
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
combined Center maybe even coordinating
 
00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
with the community college system um and
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
through those collaborations we actually
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
achieved some efficiencies in that
 
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
process um but again that project is not
 
00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
ready to bring before you because it has
 
00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
not yet finished the planning process
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
nor the local um approval process so
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
that is continuing to move forward um we
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
do do have coming up behind them we've
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
got projects in uh Milford and in
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
Peterboro and we continue to um you know
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
talk to them they are in their planning
 
00:54:09.309 --> 00:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
stage they um I believe they've even in
 
00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
Milford anyways they've begun
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
architectural work um so we think that
 
00:54:17.069 --> 00:54:17.079 align:start position:0%
those will come to you in schedule um
 
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
but the other thing to keep in mind as a
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
committee is that uh the way that we
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
have prioritized these refurbishments is
 
00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
initially you know going back I believe
 
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
as far as like back in
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
1974 uh we started the buildout of our
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
CTE centers across the state and then
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
when we got to the refurbishment process
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
we just went back to the beginning of
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
the list and have been working our way
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
through the list which has kind pretty
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
much have followed that list there have
 
00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
been some you know movement depending
 
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
upon the Readiness of the community to
 
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
be able to uh engage that work um but we
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
are approaching the end of the list
 
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
again and our working very closely with
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
the legislative committee the S sp190
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh to really decide if that's
 
00:55:05.549 --> 00:55:05.559 align:start position:0%
the appropriate approach to decide which
 
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
CP Center we build next or we work on
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
next and do we really want to tackle
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
complete refurbishments or should we
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
have a more incremental approach where
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
we're refurbishing various programs as
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
those programs need refurbishment as the
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
technology changes as new opportunities
 
00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
develop um so that should probably be
 
00:55:26.349 --> 00:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
coming before the legislature uh if not
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
this session maybe in the next session
 
00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:30.839 align:start position:0%
as well to relook at how we decide which
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
priority which projects we really want
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
to prioritize through that effort um and
 
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:37.720 align:start position:0%
then there is one other project that I
 
00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:39.079 align:start position:0%
want to just bring to your attention
 
00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:40.119 align:start position:0%
that will come to you through the
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services uh
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
this has now come before the committee
 
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know several times I think this
 
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
is might be the third time and I'm
 
00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
hoping that the third time is a charm
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
we'll see um it's not in my budget
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
because it deals with the facility that
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
I have here at the Department of
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
Education and it is a refurbishment of
 
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
the restroom facilities um at the
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
department uh the Department of
 
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
Education pre pandemic and hopefully in
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
the near future um has quite a number of
 
00:56:14.029 --> 00:56:14.039 align:start position:0%
unique outside visitors uh we receive
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
about 7,000 unique outside visitors per
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
year um and because we run all kinds of
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know boards associated with the
 
00:56:26.029 --> 00:56:26.039 align:start position:0%
education system we run a number of
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
different student programming that
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
students may have meetings or something
 
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
in this building lots of educator
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
preparation activities that go on we
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
also do the relicensing here in the
 
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:38.039 align:start position:0%
department so again 7,000 unique
 
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
visitors per year come through here um
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
the the actual facilities um are
 
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
particularly uh they may even be
 
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
considered embarrassing a little bit um
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
I've never been in the ladies room but I
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
understand that it is um potentially not
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
even safe because of unevenness of floor
 
00:56:59.549 --> 00:56:59.559 align:start position:0%
um and so this is funding to refurbish
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
those uh so that we we're not looking
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
for um you know extravagance but
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
professionalism in terms of all of those
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
unique impressions that we're making on
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
a on a regular basis each year so we
 
00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to highlight that project
 
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
for you as well and and that is the
 
00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
extent of our capital budget this year
 
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
um commissioner I remember the
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
discussions previously about the
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
restrooms at your your building from
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
prior capital budget it's I do not see
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
it in admin Services
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
requests um this year if you and
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner Arling house could get
 
00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:40.839 align:start position:0%
together before the 10th of March and
 
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
provide us with something that says what
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
the scope and cost of this would be
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
because I'm sure if I go back to last
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
capital budget discussions those figures
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
are no longer correct the comme will at
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
least look at it no guarantees that
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll be able to fund it but at
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
least now that you have raised the issue
 
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
we should have a cost factor involved
 
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
and what the scope of the work is if if
 
00:58:10.829 --> 00:58:10.839 align:start position:0%
you and and your counterpart at admin
 
00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
Services could do that I would
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate and I think most of the
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
committee would as well rather than just
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
throwing a dollar am in there yep I'm
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
happy to do that I believe we have a
 
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
scoped amount but I'll confirm that the
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
number I'm looking at on the the
 
00:58:26.589 --> 00:58:26.599 align:start position:0%
document I was provided is is is up to
 
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
date and accurate so thank you any other
 
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
Eble thank you
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
um I I apologize I'm just I'm sort of
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
confused because the governor's budget
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
is different than what you've got in
 
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
your book and we don't have a
 
00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
presentation and maybe I'm not thinking
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
quite clearly after the last two days
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
but so I just want to clarify your like
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
I want to get the total amount of your
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
requests so the first thing is the
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
generator which is 260 which doesn't hit
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
the bottom line because it's fed funds
 
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
there's the pre-engineering technology
 
00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:15.640 align:start position:0%
Hudson we always to already took care
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
of what so that so what's next so that's
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
all in other words let me I didn't I can
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
share the presentation with you I'm
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
sorry I um yeah we didn't have that you
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
had some of that the slides with you so
 
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
the only two projects that I have before
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
you are this is the first one which is
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
really the generator install over in my
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
$250,000 and that is federally funded
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
and then the other one that I have is my
 
00:59:46.109 --> 00:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
pre-engineering technology which is the
 
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
$300,000 okay all right and then the
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
bathrooms and having visited the uh
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
ladies room I can testify to the fact
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
that they really should be upgraded yes
 
00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:57.640 align:start position:0%
okay so here was the this is the
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
estimate that I have on the bathroom
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
that we I believed was in the das's
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
budget but I will connect with
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner Arley house and make sure
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
that it's there but I believe that this
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
is the updated estimate for that
 
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
work thank
 
01:00:15.029 --> 01:00:15.039 align:start position:0%
you and commissioner if you could just
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
mention what was I assume one of your
 
01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
number one priorities this the
 
01:00:21.319 --> 01:00:23.069 align:start position:0%
number one priorities this the
information

01:00:23.069 --> 01:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
system that did not make it into the
 
01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.950 align:start position:0%
system that did not make it into the
capital

01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
capital
 
01:00:29.029 --> 01:00:29.039 align:start position:0%
so it did not make it because it didn't
 
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
need to so what I did is again this is
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
another one of those projects that I
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
believe for this is my third go round at
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
it and uh but we were able to um obtain
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
a um a grant from the federal government
 
01:00:44.829 --> 01:00:44.839 align:start position:0%
to allow us to move that project forward
 
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
and therefore I didn't need to include
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
it into my capital budget and that's why
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and again this is some of the timing
 
01:00:53.069 --> 01:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
so when I was doing my budget you know
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
before the governor's phase I didn't
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
have a grant you know and then I got a
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
grant so then the governor didn't need
 
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
to put it into his budget because I've
 
01:01:02.109 --> 01:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
already found another mechanism to take
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
care of it is really what's that's the
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
reason why you don't see that carry
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
forward thank you but it always raises a
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
question when we see you know at
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
agency's number one priority not being
 
01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
even considered or talked about at all I
 
01:01:21.789 --> 01:01:21.799 align:start position:0%
went out and found somebody else to
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative Abbot yes thank you Mr
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you commissioner for
 
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just wondered if is
 
01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:38.839 align:start position:0%
sort of a followup to the Chairman's uh
 
01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
way relative
 
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 194 which we voted on
 
01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday which was
 
01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
approved by margin if I have it
 
01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.710 align:start position:0%
approved by margin if I have it
correctly

01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
194 to
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
memory student assessment information
 
01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.990 align:start position:0%
memory student assessment information
and

01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
data yeah so it is not directly
 
01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
connected to that um it would help with
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
that but it is not directly connected
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
this is the student information system
 
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
is really a an an upgrade in terms of
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
our technology across the
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
that would really just improve uh the
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
efficiency of our ability to um you know
 
01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
report gather and Report information we
 
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
will probably save man years of time at
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
the local school district uh they're
 
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
spending quite a bit of time and then
 
01:02:45.549 --> 01:02:45.559 align:start position:0%
they transmit information to the
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
department we spend quite a bit of time
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
um it will improve our ability to be
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
responsive to the legislature in terms
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
of information that they might need and
 
01:02:56.829 --> 01:02:56.839 align:start position:0%
truthfully it will improve the
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh the data security around our student
 
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839 align:start position:0%
information as well okay thank
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
you and commissioner members of the
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
committee um on the consent calendar
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
that we approved yesterday there is a
 
01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
study committee um to look at
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
CTE um
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
education and the rest it has seven
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
members of the House assuming that it
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
becomes law and I did ask that um the
 
01:03:28.349 --> 01:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
chair of Education make a note that at
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
least one member of Public Works should
 
01:03:33.069 --> 01:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
be on that study committee because we do
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
fund what is happening in it so just be
 
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
aware that one of you may get
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
tapped but it it is I think what
 
01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner is alluding to about
 
01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
studying the way we go about uh
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
prioritizing and looking at the
 
01:03:54.269 --> 01:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
technology and educational component of
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
view any other questions of the
 
01:04:05.549 --> 01:04:05.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner represent yes speaking of
 
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
CTE I'm wondering you commissioner you
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
talked about the White Field do you know
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
if the White Field School District is
 
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
going to vote next month on a proposal
 
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
to for that so that if they approved it
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
for some reason would could we consider
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
in this year's capital budget are you
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
aware of that commissioner I don't know
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
so I do actually you know Eric prow
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
worth is on the line if somebody wants
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
to bring him up he may know specifically
 
01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
more information um so Eric frow worth
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
is our CTE director in the state and I
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
know he was jumping into the call so if
 
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
somebody can promote him to VA a host um
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
so I do believe that they have an
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
application that they will be bringing
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
to their voters um but I don't know if
 
01:04:51.309 --> 01:04:51.319 align:start position:0%
it's the type of thing that you know the
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
the runway or the ramp is such that we
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
would then be able to get it in it would
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
make sense to have it in this budget or
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
we would stick it into the next budget
 
01:04:59.950 --> 01:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if Eric if you want to
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
comment on
 
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
that uh sure good morning thank you um
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
so yes uh I'm not sure if Whitefield is
 
01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
going to their March vote I can
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
certainly find out from uh our director
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
Rob Scott uh they attempted last year
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I believe they missed the vote by
 
01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
four or five votes uh so it was very
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
close uh so I believe they were working
 
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
with their architect to see where they
 
01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.150 align:start position:0%
with their architect to see where they
could

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh pair down or pair back some of their
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
proposals uh to bring the budget line at
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
them down a little bit further uh as as
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
you're aware the the town the locals are
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
responsible for 25% of the
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
construction and uh so that's what that
 
01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
had been put on their March uh last year
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
um if it did get
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
approved this March I believe it is
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
still I I don't believe they would be
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
able to start this summer they might be
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
able to start next summer they're
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
typically um you know an 18-month
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
process so uh we're we're looking at for
 
01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
example Claremont uh and Newport uh for
 
01:06:05.559 --> 01:06:06.430 align:start position:0%
example Claremont uh and Newport uh for
next

01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
year uh January of next year they would
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
bring their proposal to us uh for them
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to start the following summer
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
so it is it's a fairly long process uh
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
once they get the green light um but we
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
can certainly ask uh Whitefield uh if
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
they would could be available to start
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
24 okay thank you yeah if you could
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
please provide that any in updated
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
information to this committee on that
 
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
issue but I also have another question
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um so assuming and
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
Whitefield for some reason approves it
 
01:06:48.269 --> 01:06:48.279 align:start position:0%
and you you put to put it in it sounds
 
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
like you wouldn't put it in till the
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
next biennium but my understanding is on
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
assuming Newport and Claremont voters
 
01:06:59.269 --> 01:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
approve their share would you still have
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
include their CTE in the next
 
01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
bium for consider be correct yeah we
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
would have basically two projects coming
 
01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
at you in that next finum budget which
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
is really not un un that's kind of the
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
norm is that we normally would have two
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
that are ready to go okay all right but
 
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner if I could Echo what
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative cluder just said if
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
Whitefield were to have something on the
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
ballot this March and it is approved I
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
think that it is incumbent upon this
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
committee to at least look at coming up
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
with a portion or all of the state shair
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
so that they can begin in 23 rather than
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
waiting on the hope that the next
 
01:07:49.269 --> 01:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
legislature will do something um and
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
having a vote res sended at the top
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
level or something I I just worry about
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
that and make sure that we have our
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
chair with them at when when they begin
 
01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
to do the planning and other process
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
yeah we can absolutely follow up with
 
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
them I do know that the you know when we
 
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
were putting our budget together at that
 
01:08:13.269 --> 01:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
time they were not prepared in this mium
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%

okay thank you all it just uh much
 
01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
harder to do this um then if you're

sitting around the
 
01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.930 align:start position:0%
sitting around the
room

01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:09.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:11.270 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
um oh you got it raised representative
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
kazinski thank
 
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
you was that kalansky or kazinski
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
kalansky okay said oh he's here too
 
01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:29.630 align:start position:0%
kalansky okay said oh he's here too
somewhere

01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
now thought the clerk said he wouldn't
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
have an issue between those two I
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:46.110 align:start position:0%
 
back

01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.310 --> 01:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
there are fewer additional requests than
 
01:13:06.910 --> 01:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
right see eight or 10 and being narrowed
 
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
down to four yeah I don't know what
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
Guidance the government gave to
 
01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
people just did a lot more calling
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
before it came to us well yeah
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
but he may have told well yeah because
 
01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
that's went
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
Comm hard I think everyone yeah
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
I it would appear to me that they were
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
given a
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
harder and and the fact that while they
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
were preparing the things the governor
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
put all capital projects on because we
 
01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.430 align:start position:0%
put all capital projects on because we
didn't

01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
know going to
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
happen so you we'll see sure that
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
there'll be others like U education you
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
know well this one
 
01:14:06.189 --> 01:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
pro just like that one that was2 and
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
half million just got off the table like
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
that they're making great strides in the
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
portable bathrooms too I just wanted to
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
hallway it's funny how that seems to be
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
bathrooms I know it was a big
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
concern when we renovate one of the
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
St concern at the prison no that's we
 
01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.229 align:start position:0%
St concern at the prison no that's we
have

01:14:53.229 --> 01:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
to those mules
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
and and everything else they
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
C my wife came out of a restroom
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere we were one time and she said
 
01:15:05.629 --> 01:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
there's a couch and two really nice
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
overstuffed chairs in there and I go
 
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
I've never been in a men's room that has
 
01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:42.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to call the committee back
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
to order at this point
 
01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
it our next presentation is from the
 
01:15:54.189 --> 01:15:54.199 align:start position:0%

01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh Graham uh yeah this is we only have
 
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
one project but for fishing game this is
 
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
a rather large project um today I have
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
with me uh our immediate past chief of
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
Inland Fisheries Jason Smith and Jason
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%

01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
several years so I've asked him to
 
01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
present today I think he he has a more
 
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
detailed on background knowledge on this
 
01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
project than I do Jason fine whomever
 
01:16:37.229 --> 01:16:37.239 align:start position:0%

possible
 
01:16:42.189 --> 01:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
bner okay uh thank you representative as
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
director Mason said my name is Jason
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
Smith and I've been intimately involved
 
01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
in this project my former role here with
 
01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:48.390 align:start position:0%
in this project my former role here with
fishing

01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
fishing
 
01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
games so all of our hatcheries operate
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
under an EPA permit called the NP permit
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sure most of you are familiar with
 
01:16:59.070 --> 01:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
until this most recent permit that went
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
into effect on January 1st we never had
 
01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
any numerical values for any nutrients
 
01:17:08.629 --> 01:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
any quantitative limits in our permit
 
01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
our new permit that's been issued by EPA
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
now has numerical values for phosphorus
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
in it so in order to for our facility to
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
maintain compliance with our nepes
 
01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
permit issued by EPA we need to build
 
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
some sort of wastewater treatment
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
facility uh to remove nutrients in order
 
01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
to maintain operation of the facility
 
01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
Powder Mill hatchery in new durm is our
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
largest uh state-owned and operated Fish
 
01:17:37.629 --> 01:17:37.639 align:start position:0%
Hatchery it provides fish to about third
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
of the state these are uh brook trout
 
01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.110 align:start position:0%
of the state these are uh brook trout
rainbow

01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
rainbow
 
01:17:45.550 --> 01:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
trout and brown trout for recreational
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
angling and historically we've also
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
raised every landlock salmon that's
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
stocked into our large
 
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
lakes out of this particular facility so
 
01:17:56.910 --> 01:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
it's a very critical to uh fishing games
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
Mission here to provide these
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities and and that's why we're
 
01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
trying to move forward we're making
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
these significant investments in order
 
01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:11.790 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:13.790 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
operate uh question yeah um question
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative mononi
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you commissioner and
 
01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
and serve for taking the question could
 
01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
you just run run through this so in the
 
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
past are you saying that we had uh the
 
01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
availability to
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
discharge from your um I don't know what
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
the right term for your
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
Aqua growing directly out into another
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
water source and now we can't do that
 
01:18:48.669 --> 01:18:48.679 align:start position:0%
any longer you need to process it remove
 
01:18:50.189 --> 01:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
remove these materials is that what
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
you're telling me that is fundamentally
 
01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:55.290 align:start position:0%
correct yes
 
01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:56.830 align:start position:0%
correct yes
[Music]

01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
EO thank you um thank you for being here
 
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
today so this is a pretty big
 
01:19:13.229 --> 01:19:13.239 align:start position:0%
expenditure is there any way to split it
 
01:19:13.239 --> 01:19:14.709 align:start position:0%
expenditure is there any way to split it
up

01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
over a longer period of years or is it
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
um sort of an All or Nothing thing and
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
maybe you could just describe a little
 
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
entails so our initial draft EPA permit
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
included a five-year compliance schedule
 
01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:35.750 align:start position:0%
included a five-year compliance schedule
in

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
it and it was kind of model after the
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
state revolving funds over a Dees for
 
01:19:44.629 --> 01:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
their Wastewater program so this is
 
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
already a fairly long um drawn out
 
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
process and it will have significant
 
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
timelines but part of this process we
 
01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
still have to go into preliminary design
 
01:19:58.629 --> 01:19:58.639 align:start position:0%
and engineering and then and get you
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
know a hard number for a cost estimate
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
and then from there we'll have you know
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
a scope of services to put out the bid
 
01:20:11.629 --> 01:20:11.639 align:start position:0%
so this will be a kind of a extended
 
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
long-term um project and we won't be
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
spending all the funds all all up front
 
01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:24.430 --> 01:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
question um yeah I I mean some I don't
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
know any sometimes what we do is we
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
authorize the expend the uh expenditure
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
of the funding for the engineering and
 
01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
the preliminary scoping and then we sort
 
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
of split it up a little bit so um I
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's a number you could
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
give us for that for just discussion
 
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
purposes and yes there is and I believe
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
director Mason provided you with an
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
updated report from an engineering firm
 
01:20:52.990 --> 01:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
called ganet Fleming and in part of that
 
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
report uh there's about
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
$515,000 in that report if I recall
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
correctly that is for design and study
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
um that would probably be about a you
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
know two-year evaluation so there would
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
be a window there um and an Al
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
alternative method to get the way we
 
01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.229 align:start position:0%
 
be

01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
um Mr
 
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
Shay thank you represent Graham I just
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to confirm what the fish and game
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
department that the funding for this
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
project is Fish and Game funds correct
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
oh not General
 
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
funds that would be correct yeah so I
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
just wanted the committee to hear that
 
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
um and and I did have a question along
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
the same lines um director this will be
 
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
a big chunk of fishing game funds
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
repaying this fond can the fund absorb
 
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
that payment as well always keep up with
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
your normal operating costs um over the
 
01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
course of the the bond and any others
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
that we issue in the future for these
 
01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.910 align:start position:0%
that we issue in the future for these
same

01:22:06.910 --> 01:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
problems um at this time yes um this
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
particular banian budget we have a very
 
01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
low um request going into the general
 
01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
fund um but I don't see that you know I
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping as we move forward in the
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
future that that that funding level will
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
go up back to more historical levels
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
than where we are right now um and if
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
that takes place and if we don't you
 
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
know if we're not having any I guess if
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
I don't any unforeseen issues that would
 
01:22:46.990 --> 01:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
create larger Capital um um demands on
 
01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
the agency we should be okay thank you
 
01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.470 align:start position:0%
the agency we should be okay thank you
representative

01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
bunker hi director thank you for taking
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
my call could you remind me please what
 
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
are the revenue sources of the fish and
 
01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:58.629 align:start position:0%
are the revenue sources of the fish and
game

01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
game
 
01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
fund um license
 
01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:05.350 align:start position:0%
fund um license
sales

01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
um do we operate operate under uh us
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
fish and wildlife sport fish restoration
 
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
you any other question
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
for the director or his staff if I could
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
one more um represent
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
mononi thank you director um so um this
 
01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
facility uh the Powder Mill is is your
 
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
largest of your hatcheries is the EPA uh
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's a couple three parts Mr chairman
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
EPA requiring because of the volume of
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
this facility that you need to do this
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
and are you going to have to do similar
 
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
at your other projects for them that are
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
smaller in the
 
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
future so this is Jason again um just to
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
back up a little bit we're one of the
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
few states that is still act operating
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
our hatcheries without any type of
 
01:24:12.189 --> 01:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
numerical values for
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
nutrients um we knew this was coming
 
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
eventually but what's kind of
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
accelerated this particular
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
project is the uh the receiving water in
 
01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.110 align:start position:0%
project is the uh the receiving water in
which

01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
Hatchery discharges his effluent has
 
01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
become an impaired water body okay so
 
01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of pressure and put
 
01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
on EPA to make sure that what we if we
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
continue to operate that we are going to
 
01:24:41.629 --> 01:24:41.639 align:start position:0%
not have any additional negative impacts
 
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
of the downstream
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
environment and as far as the other
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
hatcheries goes
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
um our four of our other five hatcheries
 
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
are currently going to be put under
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
what's called the general
 
01:24:58.590 --> 01:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
permit and those General permits that I
 
01:25:00.669 --> 01:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
saw in draft form did still did not have
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
nutrients thank thank you for that so it
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
would also knowing that in the future
 
01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
that something like that may become um a
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
regulation you need to follow it seemed
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
to me when you're going through your
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
your initial engineering that you'll
 
01:25:23.790 --> 01:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
you'll have a a base map for anything
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
else smaller going forward so um would
 
01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
that would that be
 
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
true that is true um but some of the
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
figures that we provided you we were
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
kind of under some significant time
 
01:25:38.189 --> 01:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
constraints when we put this capital
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
budget together and several things that
 
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
we did not have the ability to
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
do when we put this request is due to
 
01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
covid we weren't able to have a site
 
01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
visit with the engineers who updated the
 
01:25:53.629 --> 01:25:53.639 align:start position:0%
uh an older report for the cost and at
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
that time we still did not have the
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
numerical values that actually came out
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
in our final permit so you'll see
 
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
there's a couple versions of this uh
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
document to support what we're asking
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
for and the most recent one is the one
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
that was conducted after we saw what the
 
01:26:14.109 --> 01:26:14.119 align:start position:0%
numerical values in our permit were and
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
after they had an opportunity to to see
 
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
the site and you know many of you might
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
not be aware of how our facilities
 
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
operate but this particular hat was
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
built in the 1940s and when they came to
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
do the site visit you know there was
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
some other infrastructure that probably
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
will need to be addressed in order to
 
01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
retrofit the system that we need to put
 
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
in so that kind of added to the cost uh
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
from the initial proposal as well thank
 
01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
you sh R
 
01:26:46.590 --> 01:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
Newman yes director I'm I'm I'm just a
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
little confused I'm going back to the um
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
to the 4 million6 that you're that
 
01:26:55.229 --> 01:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
you're looking for did I hear you
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
earlier say but you haven't gone out to
 
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
bid yet so this is a best guesstimate as
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
to what is anticipated to be an
 
01:27:07.470 --> 01:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
expense yeah it's an Engineers estimate
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
on what the expense will be um it in
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
5.1 okay could this go higher or Could
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
lower this is Jas I think I think you
 
01:27:28.830 --> 01:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
know I think we have a good Target as
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
far as what the costs are going to be
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
but we really won't have a hard hard
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
figure and a hard value until we really
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
roll the sleeves up and get on site and
 
01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:44.390 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
design so I'm I'm looking at a map so am
 
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
I do I does the marry Mac River flow
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
into the mar I mean maraming River flow
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
into the maraming lake that the water
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
body or what's marry meeting lake is the
 
01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
water source for this Hatchery gotcha
 
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the Hatchery and the
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
Overflow of the lake forms a Mary
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
meeting river which flows through about
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
11 miles of wetlands through several
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.629 --> 01:28:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
any further questions of the director
 
01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:31.719 align:start position:0%
and his
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
staff Mr
 
01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
Shay sorry repr G I just want to confirm
 
01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
with the Department what is the amount
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
that they need in their capital budget
 
01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposed capital budget
 
01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
is $4
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
m615 th000 you've mentioned an amount of
 
01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.229 align:start position:0%
m615 th000 you've mentioned an amount of
5.1

01:28:49.229 --> 01:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
5.1
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
million so I just wanted to clarify
 
01:28:53.070 --> 01:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
before you leave today what so the
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
committee can hear what your request
 
01:28:55.199 --> 01:28:56.750 align:start position:0%
committee can hear what your request
is

01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
so like I said this capital budget
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
proposal was put together uh with the
 
01:29:06.669 --> 01:29:06.679 align:start position:0%
updated cost estimate of 4.3 there was
 
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
another 300,000 that was added to that
 
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
because as you probably know that we
 
01:29:14.189 --> 01:29:14.199 align:start position:0%
have to contract through Bureau Public
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
Works to oversee these projects so that
 
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
I think that additional 300,000 was
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
there cost but but since we've been on
 
01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
site um there were some additional costs
 
01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
that weren't available at the time so uh
 
01:29:30.109 --> 01:29:30.119 align:start position:0%
I hate to modify a request this late in
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
the game but you know we're hoping we
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
can do it for the 4.6 but in reality
 
01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
after being on site it may be uh more
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
towards the five million
 
01:29:46.350 --> 01:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
Mark if to follow up on that um I would
 
01:29:49.229 --> 01:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
hate to give you 4.6 and come to find
 
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
out that you got to wait two years to do
 
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
anything because you don't have enough
 
01:29:53.639 --> 01:29:55.270 align:start position:0%
anything because you don't have enough
money

01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
um so we need a hard figure to put in
 
01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:04.280 align:start position:0%
this understanding that it all will be
 
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
um fishing game
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
funds understood understood but as I
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there'll be a couple
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
years of design so I don't know if there
 
01:30:15.629 --> 01:30:15.639 align:start position:0%
would be if obviously I understand your
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
approach and it's really hard to go back
 
01:30:20.189 --> 01:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
for additional funds but um we may know
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
we we may know
 
01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
more uh the next capital budget cycle
 
01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
and be able to provide the committee
 
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
more specific number I I think what I'm
 
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
getting at is you know there a couple
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
different ways to go about this and I
 
01:30:32.669 --> 01:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
think ultimately it's up to the
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
committee and and the director my
 
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
perspective we're not going to up the
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
dollar amount that is in the the
 
01:30:42.990 --> 01:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
governor's capital budget proposal that
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
is up to the committee but that's my
 
01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.310 align:start position:0%
is up to the committee but that's my
perspective

01:30:47.310 --> 01:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you before we move on to
 
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
the next presentation
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you director um what's the
 
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
current cost of a fishing license and
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
how many are sold annually like how many
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
were sold last
 
01:31:09.229 --> 01:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
year so this is Jason again um represent
 
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Jason our uh fishing license
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
fees are about $45 for a resident
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
fishing license uh non-residents are
 
01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.270 align:start position:0%
fishing license uh non-residents are
slightly

01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
slightly
 
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
higher and this is an odd year because
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
we had due to everyone being outside and
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
wanting to go fishing we had a kind of a
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
record license sale but historically we
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
year okay and and if I could just follow
 
01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
up yeah has that um has the fee the
 
01:31:48.189 --> 01:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
resident fee
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
increased or when was the last time it
 
01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
was increased we went through a license
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further questions uh
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
director Jason thank you very much for

the record as stated I am Tina deur I'm
 
01:32:54.109 --> 01:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
the CFO for the Liquor Commission we
 
01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
only have one new capital project in
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
front of you today and is for a million
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
dollars to add to our current nextg
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
project the original request was um
 
01:33:07.109 --> 01:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
included for supplemental funding for
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
the project at that time we didn't know
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
if we would need the money but since
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
then it has been determined that we need
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
the funding to add additional moraki
 
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
access points to get Wi-Fi in our stores
 
01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.189 align:start position:0%
access points to get Wi-Fi in our stores
that's

01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
250,000 400 ,000 for wirer scanners to
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
support our inventory so that the um the
 
01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
retail store clerks and employees can
 
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
scan the inventory and we need 50,000 to
 
01:33:38.669 --> 01:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
replace the office printers with
 
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
scanners to um coordinate with the new
 
01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
POS system that we're putting in place
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
we know that this time was to present
 
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
New Capital request however because this
 
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
request relates to a current project we
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
thought it would be uh prudent to bring
 
01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
in front of you our lap State extensions
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
and if you would like we can go through
 
01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:01.350 align:start position:0%
and if you would like we can go through
those

01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
now go
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
ahead so on page 3 to six you'll see the
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
nextg project it we provided you the
 
01:34:14.830 --> 01:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
original request the background and the
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
current status of the project um because
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
you have it in front of you and had time
 
01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
to review it we won't go through all of
 
01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
the pages but we would be happy to
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%

project okay if there are none then on
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
page s to8 the next um lap State
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
Extension we're asking for is for our
 
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
Hampton Stores um again we've provided

any questions you have on that project
 
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
if if we could hold off on the lasts
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
extensions there will be a separate U
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
meeting of uh um
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of the the U the committee
 
01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
to to look at all of the extensions to
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
which you will be invited um okay course
 
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to make one note that
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
all of the uh debt that's associated
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
with the projects are liquor funded we
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
have them in our
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
budget so if I look at it from what you
 
01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:18.790 align:start position:0%
budget so if I look at it from what you
said

01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
earlier um all you're asking for this
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
year is in a capital appropriation is
 
01:35:29.550 --> 01:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
the $1 million that is correct correct
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's less that we I've ever seen from
 
01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:34.390 align:start position:0%
that's less that we I've ever seen from
you

01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
guys well with revenues being up 5.3% or
 
01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
26.7 million uh I think we appreciate
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
that that I know our representative
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
abbit question yes thank you Mr chairman
 
01:35:53.070 --> 01:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question I
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
just um would ask the standard question
 
01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
has this um request been run through the
 
01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:03.270 align:start position:0%
has this um request been run through the
IT

01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
IT
 
01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
department yes we're working closely
 
01:36:13.149 --> 01:36:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
um as long as you're here I wondered if
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
you could share any comments or thoughts
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
on the recent audit
 
01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
report all I can say representative is
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
that we're always uh grateful for any
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
type of uh audit that we get at the
 
01:36:45.629 --> 01:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
commission because we feel that it makes
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
us a better business and we're working
 
01:36:51.390 --> 01:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
forward uh we have uh uh the meeting set
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
in March and we're very confident that
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
the committee will be very happy with
 
01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
the progress that the commission makes
 
01:37:01.629 --> 01:37:01.639 align:start position:0%
in that period of time we don't look at
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
this as uh anything negative uh
 
01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:08.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh audits happen and they
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
they they they look at a certain segment
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
of time and the commission has grown
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
well beyond that uh since that period of
 
01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
time and I think that uh the business
 
01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
running the way it is and as profitable
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
as it has been uh there's going to be
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
growing pains as you go through those
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
types of things and like anything else
 
01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
that has been brought before us in the
 
01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
last 10 years we will uh overcome that
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
and we'll make sure that we're where we
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
concerned any further
 
01:37:54.669 --> 01:37:54.679 align:start position:0%
questions I to wrap up um
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
representative mononi uh thank you um
 
01:38:01.149 --> 01:38:01.159 align:start position:0%
and my question would be a little easier
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
so um we we saw Revenue numbers
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
projected and uh they're favorable
 
01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
through uh this last year with covid and
 
01:38:12.189 --> 01:38:12.199 align:start position:0%
so forth for whatever reasons when are
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
you going to bring back our two times a
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
year discount for liquor
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
sales you me they have no control over
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
it and I was hoping to discuss it with
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
you today
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
well representative thank you for the
 
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
question uh obviously the Liquor
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
Commission is uh statuto obligated to uh
 
01:38:36.589 --> 01:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
make make a profit and be as profitable
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
as we can be and through our research uh
 
01:38:42.669 --> 01:38:42.679 align:start position:0%
we have found that those types of sales
 
01:38:45.589 --> 01:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
do they drive sales but they do not
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
drive net profit so what we found in
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
going with a monthly sale a category
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
sale like you're seeing a do now uh with
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
a 15 or 20% discount uh tends to be more
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
profitable for the commission and thus
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
more profitable for the general fund so
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
I do not think unfortunately for the
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
question that you've raised that you'll
 
01:39:12.430 --> 01:39:12.440 align:start position:0%
see those types of sales come back in
 
01:39:15.310 --> 01:39:15.320 align:start position:0%
the near future we're
 
01:39:18.990 --> 01:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
crushed are crushed all right Christmas
 
01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:19.960 align:start position:0%

01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440 align:start position:0%

01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
questions about the capital projects of
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%

this past uh Wednesday so I'm trying to
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
work out when we can have the formal
 
01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
on um House Bill 25 which I signed off
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
on yesterday you will be getting a hard
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
copy I believe Mr Shay um of that um
 
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
sometime in the near future um it
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
essentially mirrors what was in the go
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
Governor's Proposal with a couple of
 
01:42:24.189 --> 01:42:24.199 align:start position:0%
changes um
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
I am still trying to figure out in
 
01:42:28.589 --> 01:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the speaker in his
 
01:42:30.990 --> 01:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
office whether or not that public
 
01:42:34.350 --> 01:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
hearing and any subsequent work sessions
 
01:42:37.589 --> 01:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
and executive sessions can be held
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
completely remote or not um as you can
 
01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
imagine um with 20 committees trying to
 
01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
finish their work in a very short couple
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
of three weeks um room space um due to
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
covid is very tight
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
I will hopefully know by Monday anything
 
01:43:00.990 --> 01:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
for those following two weeks
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
um um after the the 12th of March on
 
01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
where we're going and what we have um I
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
will keep the committee informed and for
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
the public who is listening all of that
 
01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
will also appear obviously in the the
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
calendar and with that I didn't quite
 
01:43:23.229 --> 01:43:23.239 align:start position:0%
time this all out um our next
 
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
presentation is not until 1:00 as it
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
says in the calendar does any member of
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
the committee have a comment or question
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%
point seeing none we are in recess until
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
1 pm and we have two committees to hear
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
from one of which was alluded to um by
 
01:43:53.350 --> 01:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
fishing Gabe Dees and the other one
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections did Mr Shay
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
has his hand
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
up or had it
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
up I I'm sorry represent Graham I just
 
01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
was I didn't know if you were gonna say
 
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
anything more um I just wanted to
 
01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
confirm yes um I'll work with Brad and
 
01:44:10.589 --> 01:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
and a hard copy of House Bill 25 will be
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
provided to the committee along with um
 
01:44:14.669 --> 01:44:14.679 align:start position:0%
for those members that have been on the
 
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
committee in the past the the compare
 
01:44:19.629 --> 01:44:19.639 align:start position:0%
sheet that we fill out so there'll be a
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
um a list of all the projects that are
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
in the House Bill 25 and then what the
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended amount is and
 
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
then um there'll be empty space for the
 
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
house to fill in their ideas or what
 
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
they want to do and I will also send out
 
01:44:36.750 --> 01:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
a um lapse extension worksheet as well
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
so everybody will get all that because
 
01:44:39.629 --> 01:44:39.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure who will end up
 
01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
participating at the laps extension
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
meetings but um so so I just want to let
 
01:44:45.709 --> 01:44:45.719 align:start position:0%
the committee know that that that you
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
will get some paper from me in the next
 
01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh few days anyways you probably be
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
about a week before you actually see it
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
by the time the mail gets to you but
 
01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
once House Bill 25 is available to make
 
01:45:01.149 --> 01:45:01.159 align:start position:0%
copies of and um create those um those
 
01:45:03.149 --> 01:45:03.159 align:start position:0%
documents I just described to you we'll
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
get them copied and in the mail to you
 
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
so I hope hopefully by Monday and Mr
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
Shay you will also be sending those uh
 
01:45:12.189 --> 01:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
work sheet compare sheets out
 
01:45:14.589 --> 01:45:14.599 align:start position:0%
electronically I believe oh absolutely
 
01:45:17.070 --> 01:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
everything will go out electronically as
 
01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:21.159 align:start position:0%
well um and and will be found on our
 
01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
website so that if if you don't get the
 
01:45:27.589 --> 01:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
mail in time it will be available um to
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
at least have it electronically when I
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
send it to you I'll send it to you in
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
Excel so that you can um you know thank

might want to put in
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
there I will also put it in a PDF file
 
01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
too for those members that find it
 
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
easier to print a PDF
 
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:48.920 align:start position:0%

03:32:26.670 --> 03:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
dams in the State uh state owned dams uh
 
03:32:29.790 --> 03:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
we have uh in this case we have uh an
 
03:32:34.110 --> 03:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
$8.1 million request uh to do several uh
 
03:32:37.349 --> 03:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
major components to that type of work uh
 
03:32:39.550 --> 03:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
so so on eight dams is repair and
 
03:32:41.830 --> 03:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
reconstruction work uh we have
 
03:32:43.830 --> 03:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
engineering and design uh work that
 
03:32:46.469 --> 03:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
needs to be done on on several dams and
 
03:32:50.070 --> 03:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
preparation for the final actual Spade
 
03:32:53.110 --> 03:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
work so to speak uh hydrological work on
 
03:32:56.189 --> 03:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
three dams and uh very importantly uh an
 
03:32:59.309 --> 03:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
asset management plan work to be done as
 
03:33:02.189 --> 03:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
we do which I'll talk about in a moment
 
03:33:06.189 --> 03:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh to assess uh where we are for for
 
03:33:07.110 --> 03:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
our our
 
03:33:12.030 --> 03:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
dams um so with that uh we'll move Chris
 
03:33:13.510 --> 03:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
is already moving me ahead that's good
 
03:33:16.110 --> 03:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
03:33:19.030 --> 03:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh so uh running through these just to
 
03:33:21.189 --> 03:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
give you an idea of the the the Dan that
 
03:33:25.309 --> 03:33:25.319 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh the wi uh
 
03:33:28.670 --> 03:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
River Watershed uh needs hydrologic and
 
03:33:28.680 --> 03:33:30.269 align:start position:0%
River Watershed uh needs hydrologic and
hydraulic

03:33:30.269 --> 03:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
hydraulic
 
03:33:33.830 --> 03:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
evaluations uh and uh as part of their
 
03:33:36.309 --> 03:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh new emergency action plans uh for the
 
03:33:39.510 --> 03:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
dam which is a requ federal requirement
 
03:33:44.070 --> 03:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh and uh again the the typical work
 
03:33:46.269 --> 03:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
we're doing uh involves
 
03:33:48.269 --> 03:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
dams that have a relatively high impact
 
03:33:51.070 --> 03:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
to Downstream so high Hazard dams that
 
03:33:53.070 --> 03:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
that type of activity again we can talk
 
03:33:56.150 --> 03:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
to that also uh as you see here we have
 
03:33:57.990 --> 03:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
work work for mendums
 
03:34:02.389 --> 03:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
pond uh and py Way Lake dams Mar meeting
 
03:34:04.389 --> 03:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
River dams which are three uh fish and
 
03:34:06.950 --> 03:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
game owned dams surrounding Mery meeting
 
03:34:09.710 --> 03:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
Lake uh and they all need a feasibility
 
03:34:12.309 --> 03:34:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh study to determine the cost and
 
03:34:14.550 --> 03:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
effort needed to bring excuse me bring
 
03:34:16.750 --> 03:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
them into safety uh compliance with
 
03:34:20.110 --> 03:34:20.120 align:start position:0%
safety requirements uh the last issue uh
 
03:34:22.229 --> 03:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
item here and it's not by priority by
 
03:34:25.469 --> 03:34:25.479 align:start position:0%
any means is an asset management plan so
 
03:34:27.150 --> 03:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
one thing I do want to alert the
 
03:34:29.710 --> 03:34:29.720 align:start position:0%
legislators uh on the on the the call
 
03:34:34.030 --> 03:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
here is uh the the obviously we spent a
 
03:34:35.349 --> 03:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
lot of time
 
03:34:37.990 --> 03:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
assessing uh the condition of our dams
 
03:34:39.510 --> 03:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
to figure out what work needs to be done
 
03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
and making sure they're safe for obvious
 
03:34:45.030 --> 03:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
reasons uh it's important for us to be
 
03:34:46.189 --> 03:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
able to
 
03:34:48.790 --> 03:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
to uh spend a little bit more time to
 
03:34:51.870 --> 03:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
get uh an asset management plan in place
 
03:34:54.950 --> 03:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
and work done on that end so uh of the
 
03:34:58.229 --> 03:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
274 state owned dams we don't even
 
03:35:01.030 --> 03:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
though we have looked at them we don't
 
03:35:03.070 --> 03:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
have a complete comprehensive management
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
plan for all the dams and that includes
 
03:35:08.429 --> 03:35:08.439 align:start position:0%
an assessment of their condition so uh I
 
03:35:10.830 --> 03:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
guess what I what I want to as a
 
03:35:13.870 --> 03:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
takeaway for you all not in this budget
 
03:35:15.870 --> 03:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh but the the bad news is the more we
 
03:35:18.870 --> 03:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
look at the condition of our dams uh on
 
03:35:20.189 --> 03:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
on average they're you know we're
 
03:35:22.189 --> 03:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
talking over 100 years for many of these
 
03:35:24.670 --> 03:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
dams uh we're finding more and more work
 
03:35:27.150 --> 03:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be done uh this Asset
 
03:35:29.269 --> 03:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
Management plan uh and that work will
 
03:35:31.229 --> 03:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
help us quantify that a little bit
 
03:35:35.710 --> 03:35:35.720 align:start position:0%
better uh so I I I don't have a great uh
 
03:35:37.349 --> 03:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
story saying the costs are going to go
 
03:35:39.670 --> 03:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
down but it it's it's critical work and
 
03:35:40.870 --> 03:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
obviously we need have need to have a
 
03:35:43.630 --> 03:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
great handle a better handle uh on what
 
03:35:45.630 --> 03:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
that will mean mean uh moving forward
 
03:35:48.309 --> 03:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
board so uh that's what that Asset
 
03:35:50.790 --> 03:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
Management plan light item is by the way
 
03:35:53.630 --> 03:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
so uh if we go to the next slide Chris
 
03:35:56.309 --> 03:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you I do have one question on that
 
03:36:00.830 --> 03:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
last slide yes sir the Mary meeting
 
03:36:05.429 --> 03:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
River dams we heard this morning from uh
 
03:36:09.349 --> 03:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
fishing game about their um Hatchery
 
03:36:11.389 --> 03:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
that feeds either feeds off of that or
 
03:36:13.750 --> 03:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
feeds into it I forget which way it went
 
03:36:15.910 --> 03:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
is this being planned in conjunction
 
03:36:19.349 --> 03:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
with the work that they are undertaking
 
03:36:19.359 --> 03:36:20.229 align:start position:0%
with the work that they are undertaking
to

03:36:20.229 --> 03:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:36:23.710 --> 03:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
control um the the phosphorus that's
 
03:36:25.750 --> 03:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
coming out of their
 
03:36:28.910 --> 03:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
Hatchery it's not directly related so as
 
03:36:31.349 --> 03:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
you're aware the the Potter Mill
 
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
Hatchery uh you know again at the design
 
03:36:35.710 --> 03:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
at the time made a lot of sense but
 
03:36:37.750 --> 03:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it takes up almost 100% of
 
03:36:39.710 --> 03:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
the water body as it flows through the
 
03:36:43.590 --> 03:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
hatry uh and and the the U the impact of
 
03:36:45.790 --> 03:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
the fish are are having an impact in a
 
03:36:48.429 --> 03:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
federal federal EPA permitting issue
 
03:36:50.790 --> 03:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
that that's going on with that so no so
 
03:36:52.510 --> 03:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
short answer is no these aren't directly
 
03:36:55.550 --> 03:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
related uh not to be flipping about it
 
03:36:57.309 --> 03:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
but I guess if the dams were to let go
 
03:36:59.189 --> 03:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
that would wash away the problem but I
 
03:37:00.590 --> 03:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody wants that but
 
03:37:02.710 --> 03:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not directly
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:11.229 --> 03:37:11.239 align:start position:0%
you having said that we're we're we're
 
03:37:13.070 --> 03:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
very involved with fishing game and and
 
03:37:14.790 --> 03:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
trying to help them on that that that
 
03:37:17.550 --> 03:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
issue by the way so uh that's important
 
03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
to us too in the state as you know so
 
03:37:23.630 --> 03:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
the next slide is our our One Stop is
 
03:37:26.030 --> 03:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
the name we've given our
 
03:37:29.910 --> 03:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
Collective collection of uh databases so
 
03:37:31.990 --> 03:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of regulatory programs a
 
03:37:35.510 --> 03:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
lot of uh environmental results programs
 
03:37:36.990 --> 03:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
you know what's your water quality that
 
03:37:40.110 --> 03:37:40.120 align:start position:0%
type of thing uh in the agency so over
 
03:37:42.870 --> 03:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
20 years uh out of hid so to speak we've
 
03:37:46.389 --> 03:37:46.399 align:start position:0%
kind of clued together uh electronic
 
03:37:48.910 --> 03:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
means to access these type of systems
 
03:37:50.830 --> 03:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
including to some extent
 
03:37:54.910 --> 03:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
permitting uh that is a really you know
 
03:37:56.670 --> 03:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
was it was necessary and it's important
 
03:37:58.710 --> 03:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
to many people including us the
 
03:38:02.189 --> 03:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
regulated Community uh uh and just the
 
03:38:05.710 --> 03:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
general citizenry it's very outdated and
 
03:38:08.429 --> 03:38:08.439 align:start position:0%
probably you got my uh tone by saying
 
03:38:10.830 --> 03:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
they were Clues together so uh what
 
03:38:12.550 --> 03:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
we're finding is that's not real
 
03:38:14.710 --> 03:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
sustainable right right now so what as
 
03:38:16.590 --> 03:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
an example
 
03:38:19.030 --> 03:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh over a year a little over a year ago
 
03:38:23.150 --> 03:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh we had uh doit did a had one of their
 
03:38:25.630 --> 03:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
contractors was looking at the system
 
03:38:27.750 --> 03:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
found that even the coding for some of
 
03:38:30.070 --> 03:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
these databases created cyber security
 
03:38:32.150 --> 03:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
issues which which could easily
 
03:38:35.309 --> 03:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
compromise all the data in the systems
 
03:38:37.030 --> 03:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh so we had to we were forced to pull
 
03:38:39.950 --> 03:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
that that system down that collect
 
03:38:42.269 --> 03:38:42.279 align:start position:0%
collection of systems down so the I
 
03:38:45.750 --> 03:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
guess the good news to that was uh it
 
03:38:47.990 --> 03:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
did have the impact of clearly
 
03:38:50.110 --> 03:38:50.120 align:start position:0%
demonstrating how important this is to
 
03:38:52.910 --> 03:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
everybody so we we instantly got calls
 
03:38:56.309 --> 03:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
from many many people uh expressing
 
03:38:58.110 --> 03:38:58.120 align:start position:0%
concerns about it and when can we get it
 
03:39:00.790 --> 03:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
back up so uh you know again there
 
03:39:02.590 --> 03:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
there's always a silver lining I suppose
 
03:39:05.469 --> 03:39:05.479 align:start position:0%
but that really uh helped reinforce with
 
03:39:08.269 --> 03:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
us how important this this work is so
 
03:39:11.830 --> 03:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
with that uh we we uh have a line item
 
03:39:14.910 --> 03:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
here to to help work on that it's really
 
03:39:17.630 --> 03:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
critical in my mind uh in order to to
 
03:39:21.030 --> 03:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
keep us as customer service friendly as
 
03:39:22.870 --> 03:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
possible and as effective as possible
 
03:39:26.309 --> 03:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
too as you may imagine uh you know again
 
03:39:28.590 --> 03:39:28.600 align:start position:0%
good news bad news once we get to a
 
03:39:30.710 --> 03:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
point where people are are working on
 
03:39:33.550 --> 03:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
their applications for permits uh or
 
03:39:36.830 --> 03:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
licensing that type of thing online uh
 
03:39:38.750 --> 03:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
that there's rightly so an expectation
 
03:39:40.590 --> 03:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
that we we keep doing those type of
 
03:39:42.790 --> 03:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
things and we we totally agree but you
 
03:39:44.870 --> 03:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
know as as you I'm sure you're aware
 
03:39:46.630 --> 03:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
that that takes
 
03:39:51.710 --> 03:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
um uh resources uh the last item on this
 
03:39:54.510 --> 03:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
um the last bullet on this slide is our
 
03:39:57.750 --> 03:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
air monitoring stations so we are also
 
03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh I I mentioned uh environmental data
 
03:40:05.429 --> 03:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh we monitor air pollution uh levels uh
 
03:40:07.030 --> 03:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
which thankfully have gotten better and
 
03:40:09.830 --> 03:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
better by the way uh in the State uh
 
03:40:13.110 --> 03:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and uh that is
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
intended to be an automated system uh we
 
03:40:17.189 --> 03:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
actually have during certain times of
 
03:40:19.950 --> 03:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
the year when we have air quality issues
 
03:40:22.110 --> 03:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
uh we have have systems so that can be
 
03:40:24.349 --> 03:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
viewed by the public so they can make
 
03:40:25.830 --> 03:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
judgment calls for instance do I go
 
03:40:28.030 --> 03:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
hiking today that type of thing and we
 
03:40:29.670 --> 03:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
have statutory requirements from the
 
03:40:33.830 --> 03:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
feds uh the EPA uh of getting that data
 
03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
to the federal system also uh so this
 
03:40:38.429 --> 03:40:38.439 align:start position:0%
would help with up upgrading that the
 
03:40:40.510 --> 03:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
the station equipment generally is over
 
03:40:43.590 --> 03:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
10 years old that we're all of it that
 
03:40:46.429 --> 03:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh and and it's hard
 
03:40:49.750 --> 03:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
hard to find replacement parts and uh it
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's failing in in different aspects so
 
03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
that's the other part of that uh last
 
03:40:56.070 --> 03:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
bullet there so Chris if we can go to
 
03:40:58.469 --> 03:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:02.349 --> 03:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
slide so uh this part of the B budget
 
03:41:06.070 --> 03:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
request is for the state match for both
 
03:41:08.189 --> 03:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
clean water and drinking water State
 
03:41:10.710 --> 03:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
revolving loan funds uh most of you are
 
03:41:12.990 --> 03:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
probably aware of that uh drinking water
 
03:41:16.229 --> 03:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
obviously is is self uh explanatory
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
clean water for those who aren't
 
03:41:20.710 --> 03:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
initiated with that I think uh
 
03:41:23.469 --> 03:41:23.479 align:start position:0%
Wastewater and Sewer uh type things so
 
03:41:26.590 --> 03:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
that's it's to get the water cleaner uh
 
03:41:30.309 --> 03:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
but uh right now the state's required uh
 
03:41:35.870 --> 03:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
to do a 20% match uh the good news is
 
03:41:40.710 --> 03:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh both for clean water and for drinking
 
03:41:43.349 --> 03:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
water uh it's it's really a force
 
03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
multiplier uh in in order to to get
 
03:41:48.590 --> 03:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
federal funds in so uh again as the last
 
03:41:51.870 --> 03:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
bullet shows uh uh that those funds will
 
03:41:54.070 --> 03:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
provide mats for $60 million in federal
 
03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
funds which uh by and large go to the
 
03:41:59.710 --> 03:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh again uh it's a low
 
03:42:01.349 --> 03:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
interest interest Loan program with the
 
03:42:02.710 --> 03:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
potential for loan
 
03:42:05.550 --> 03:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
forgiveness uh and it really enables a
 
03:42:07.110 --> 03:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
lot of municipalities to do the work
 
03:42:09.229 --> 03:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
that they need to do uh for this
 
03:42:11.790 --> 03:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
citizens so it's uh again the good news
 
03:42:14.349 --> 03:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
bad news story as always is uh these
 
03:42:17.830 --> 03:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
programs are over subscribed uh uh and
 
03:42:19.990 --> 03:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
and we hear hearing inklings uh that
 
03:42:21.750 --> 03:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
there may be depending on what happens
 
03:42:24.030 --> 03:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
in Congress more funds coming in but we
 
03:42:26.110 --> 03:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
we're we've had nothing to verify that
 
03:42:28.630 --> 03:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
yet so that's uh not before us at the
 
03:42:33.429 --> 03:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
moment so uh Chris uh the final
 
03:42:36.590 --> 03:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
slide so the wabaki River Basin program
 
03:42:38.590 --> 03:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
so that's uh for those who aren't
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with that that is a regional uh
 
03:42:43.790 --> 03:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
waste R treatment facility that is owned
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
and operated by the state of New
 
03:42:47.550 --> 03:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we we have staff there and uh
 
03:42:50.630 --> 03:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
operators there it it uh is funded
 
03:42:53.750 --> 03:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
through 10 communities uh uh ranging
 
03:42:58.830 --> 03:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
from Meredith to Franklin uh and that so
 
03:43:00.950 --> 03:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
that is not a general fund request for
 
03:43:04.269 --> 03:43:04.279 align:start position:0%
capital budget monies uh but it is uh
 
03:43:07.149 --> 03:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
certainly uh funded by those municip
 
03:43:09.870 --> 03:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
those participating municipalities uh
 
03:43:13.229 --> 03:43:13.239 align:start position:0%
entities uh and much similar to most
 
03:43:16.389 --> 03:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
facilities uh the certain parts of the
 
03:43:19.550 --> 03:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
facility are over 40 years old and need
 
03:43:23.110 --> 03:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
replacing uh there there's a board that
 
03:43:28.189 --> 03:43:28.199 align:start position:0%
um helps guide the agency uh in uh uh
 
03:43:30.630 --> 03:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
making decisions on the the future of
 
03:43:32.670 --> 03:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
the plant and and how it's operated in
 
03:43:36.349 --> 03:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
in Investments uh that Advisory Board uh
 
03:43:40.070 --> 03:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
fully supports uh these these
 
03:43:43.349 --> 03:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
requests um and uh again it will be
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
funded through uh talked about clean
 
03:43:48.429 --> 03:43:48.439 align:start position:0%
water srf State revolving loans uh and
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
paid back through uh the assessments of
 
03:43:53.229 --> 03:43:53.239 align:start position:0%
the communities again so this will be uh
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
funded FR for the uh users in this case
 
03:43:59.990 --> 03:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
so with that uh and again uh we're just
 
03:44:02.110 --> 03:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
trying to give you a brief overview uh
 
03:44:04.710 --> 03:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
we're happy to answer questions uh again
 
03:44:08.269 --> 03:44:08.279 align:start position:0%
I have some key staff here also uh if we
 
03:44:11.670 --> 03:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
end up uh if if you are get beyond my
 
03:44:14.630 --> 03:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
ability or Sue which uh you you you
 
03:44:16.110 --> 03:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
could easily get beyond my ability to
 
03:44:17.870 --> 03:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
answer questions perhaps but I'm going
 
03:44:20.030 --> 03:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
to guess probably not Sue Carlson's but
 
03:44:21.910 --> 03:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
in either case uh we have staff here
 
03:44:23.710 --> 03:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
available for you
 
03:44:27.510 --> 03:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
all thank you H representative Jack uh
 
03:44:29.030 --> 03:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman can you hear me
 
03:44:30.510 --> 03:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
all from here people have had trouble
 
03:44:30.520 --> 03:44:32.550 align:start position:0%
all from here people have had trouble
with

03:44:32.550 --> 03:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:44:34.870 --> 03:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
that first of all I was delighted to
 
03:44:37.790 --> 03:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
hear you use the word clu uh secondly
 
03:44:40.349 --> 03:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
going back to the onetop system are you
 
03:44:42.510 --> 03:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
coordinating with doic so that you're
 
03:44:44.670 --> 03:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
harmonizing your development with uh the
 
03:44:44.680 --> 03:44:45.990 align:start position:0%
harmonizing your development with uh the
direction

03:44:45.990 --> 03:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
direction
 
03:44:50.070 --> 03:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
that they go every day yes absolutely
 
03:44:52.389 --> 03:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
they are a key part of this we they
 
03:44:55.630 --> 03:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
actually have uh a group that actually
 
03:44:58.710 --> 03:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
resides uh in the building here well
 
03:45:00.469 --> 03:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
they share the the greater building but
 
03:45:02.349 --> 03:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
they have a group group that that are
 
03:45:05.189 --> 03:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
integrated with our staff and uh work
 
03:45:07.349 --> 03:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
with us on a daily basis for that very
 
03:45:09.550 --> 03:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
reason know we we don't do this without
 
03:45:12.550 --> 03:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
them thank you that's great to
 
03:45:16.030 --> 03:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
hear representative makoni thank you
 
03:45:18.830 --> 03:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner and others I'm
 
03:45:21.710 --> 03:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
viewing a screen from 30 feet away so I
 
03:45:23.750 --> 03:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
apologize um first of all I've got to
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Jim Gallagher and his crew
 
03:45:30.710 --> 03:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh the job they did on the Osby Lake uh
 
03:45:33.590 --> 03:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh work for our dam was just exceptional
 
03:45:36.630 --> 03:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh Crews worked extremely well with the
 
03:45:38.750 --> 03:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
town and we never had any
 
03:45:42.349 --> 03:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
fluctuation whatsoever of our lake so uh
 
03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
I can't say enough about that that kind
 
03:45:47.110 --> 03:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
of ends my nice thoughts here so I have
 
03:45:50.189 --> 03:45:50.199 align:start position:0%
a couple more questions so if you if you
 
03:45:51.950 --> 03:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
could if you could help Mr chairman if
 
03:45:56.110 --> 03:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
it's okay on the on the OneStop program
 
03:45:58.110 --> 03:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
uh which has been absolutely wonderful
 
03:46:01.149 --> 03:46:01.159 align:start position:0%
over the years a single Source a place
 
03:46:02.910 --> 03:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
to go to to find
 
03:46:06.149 --> 03:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
information and I have occasion to use
 
03:46:11.030 --> 03:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
it myself uh almost on a daily basis uh
 
03:46:13.630 --> 03:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
when the when the program went down when
 
03:46:15.750 --> 03:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
the website shut down
 
03:46:18.070 --> 03:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
I was disappointed how long it took to
 
03:46:21.790 --> 03:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
bring subsurface back on uh but I'm
 
03:46:25.429 --> 03:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
going to move beyond that so uh
 
03:46:28.870 --> 03:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
subsurface Works inside one stop or is
 
03:46:31.830 --> 03:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
the subsurface uh website separate from
 
03:46:31.840 --> 03:46:33.349 align:start position:0%
the subsurface uh website separate from
one

03:46:33.349 --> 03:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:46:36.070 --> 03:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
stop it's a thank you representative so
 
03:46:37.990 --> 03:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's a component of the one stop as I
 
03:46:40.110 --> 03:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh that's why I use the word
 
03:46:43.309 --> 03:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
clu so we have these these individual
 
03:46:46.510 --> 03:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
systems that were uh created and the one
 
03:46:49.110 --> 03:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
stop is the the connectivity if you will
 
03:46:52.670 --> 03:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
for that uh and again I and I I I know
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
you said you'd move past that but the
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
the the system being down was not uh you
 
03:47:00.429 --> 03:47:00.439 align:start position:0%
know desirable for from anyone one trust
 
03:47:02.750 --> 03:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
me but again to give you an idea of that
 
03:47:05.910 --> 03:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
so the the coding the SQL coding that
 
03:47:07.670 --> 03:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
was done in those systems was the
 
03:47:10.870 --> 03:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
problem so we were in a mode where
 
03:47:13.550 --> 03:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
really so all that was so out INE
 
03:47:17.070 --> 03:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
equated uh that they had to recode uh
 
03:47:19.070 --> 03:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
all those systems to get those back up
 
03:47:21.189 --> 03:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
and and running so they they wouldn't be
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh causing the problem they were so that
 
03:47:26.910 --> 03:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
that's the the how far how far in if you
 
03:47:29.870 --> 03:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
will uh the problems uh were so that's
 
03:47:32.469 --> 03:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
why it took so long so uh our hope is
 
03:47:34.030 --> 03:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
obviously never to be in that position
 
03:47:35.670 --> 03:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
again which is why one of the reasons
 
03:47:37.389 --> 03:47:37.399 align:start position:0%
why we're asking for these
 
03:47:40.429 --> 03:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
funds and thank you and all the all the
 
03:47:44.550 --> 03:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
people in it that worked on that so um
 
03:47:47.469 --> 03:47:47.479 align:start position:0%
some subsurface are able to process
 
03:47:47.479 --> 03:47:48.910 align:start position:0%
some subsurface are able to process
payment

03:47:48.910 --> 03:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
payment
 
03:47:52.349 --> 03:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
directly but wetlands and others natural
 
03:47:55.870 --> 03:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
heritage uh Bureau and others are do not
 
03:47:59.389 --> 03:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
have that um and it makes it hard much
 
03:48:02.790 --> 03:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
harder to do business and causes delays
 
03:48:05.750 --> 03:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
and any part of this $5 million
 
03:48:08.389 --> 03:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
investment um is Wetlands going to be
 
03:48:10.990 --> 03:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
able to start processing applications
 
03:48:14.550 --> 03:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
through uh similar to subsurface and
 
03:48:16.830 --> 03:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
will will you in the near future be able
 
03:48:19.630 --> 03:48:19.640 align:start position:0%
to process payments for
 
03:48:21.790 --> 03:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
Wetlands certainly that is the goal for
 
03:48:24.149 --> 03:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
all our our programs that that uh have
 
03:48:26.389 --> 03:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
that type of uh functionality uh so that
 
03:48:29.389 --> 03:48:29.399 align:start position:0%
is definitely our goal uh your last
 
03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
question was what the timing uh is is
 
03:48:33.710 --> 03:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
that correct representative yes please
 
03:48:35.950 --> 03:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so I I don't have visibility into
 
03:48:40.070 --> 03:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
that I you know my experience is uh
 
03:48:42.910 --> 03:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
again we work very closely with doit uh
 
03:48:44.030 --> 03:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes we contract some of the
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
workout and obviously the program staff
 
03:48:48.510 --> 03:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
have to be spend a lot of time involved
 
03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
with this my experience is uh I don't
 
03:48:53.670 --> 03:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
trust estimates uh meaning they're
 
03:48:56.950 --> 03:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
typically a lot longer so uh so my
 
03:48:58.990 --> 03:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
experience is it takes longer than than
 
03:49:02.229 --> 03:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
we are told and longer than we expect uh
 
03:49:05.110 --> 03:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
so uh I I i' very be very hesitant to
 
03:49:07.309 --> 03:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
make any promises though it is high on
 
03:49:10.309 --> 03:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
our priority list thank you and one more
 
03:49:13.309 --> 03:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
if I could Mr chairman last one y thank
 
03:49:19.309 --> 03:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
you the um I understand uh or I hear
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
that the department is about to change
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
companies that process online payments
 
03:49:29.149 --> 03:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
in the next month or two and if if that
 
03:49:30.590 --> 03:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
is the case if you can just tell me if
 
03:49:32.710 --> 03:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
it is or isn't going to happen and
 
03:49:35.110 --> 03:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
number two are you assured when this
 
03:49:38.389 --> 03:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
happens there will be a seamless and and
 
03:49:41.269 --> 03:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
not a long downtime between
 
03:49:44.110 --> 03:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
vendors so a couple things first of all
 
03:49:45.830 --> 03:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
the department is doing that but it's
 
03:49:48.269 --> 03:49:48.279 align:start position:0%
it's Statewide it's not Department did
 
03:49:49.790 --> 03:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
not direct this so this is the credit
 
03:49:52.630 --> 03:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
card vendor uh and my understanding is
 
03:49:54.429 --> 03:49:54.439 align:start position:0%
that the time frame for that was
 
03:49:56.309 --> 03:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
extended for another six months to
 
03:49:58.670 --> 03:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
ensure that there would be an orderly
 
03:50:01.229 --> 03:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
trans transition if you will and we have
 
03:50:03.229 --> 03:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
people uh working on that coding as we
 
03:50:05.469 --> 03:50:05.479 align:start position:0%
as we speak so that's our intention and
 
03:50:08.030 --> 03:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
I think the six-month uh extension if
 
03:50:10.389 --> 03:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
you will will help that thank thank you
 
03:50:13.630 --> 03:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
for your time sir representative
 
03:50:16.630 --> 03:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
edar thank you Mr chairman and uh thank
 
03:50:18.750 --> 03:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
you commissioner for addressing my
 
03:50:21.990 --> 03:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
questions there were two matching funds
 
03:50:24.630 --> 03:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
which were decreased from your request
 
03:50:28.510 --> 03:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
uh the governor decreased them um you
 
03:50:30.429 --> 03:50:30.439 align:start position:0%
seem to indicate that these type of
 
03:50:32.469 --> 03:50:32.479 align:start position:0%
funds are over subscribed there there's
 
03:50:34.790 --> 03:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of request form uh what's the
 
03:50:37.309 --> 03:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
effect of not uh funding it to the
 
03:50:39.030 --> 03:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
amount that you
 
03:50:41.110 --> 03:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
requested yeah so again it's not an
 
03:50:43.710 --> 03:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
ideal the the the fact that there they
 
03:50:45.269 --> 03:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
made some Cuts there there but we do
 
03:50:47.950 --> 03:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
think it's workable uh so if if it's all
 
03:50:50.670 --> 03:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
right uh Mr chair I'll ask Sue Carlson
 
03:50:52.630 --> 03:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
our chief operating officer to aine a
 
03:50:53.710 --> 03:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
little bit on
 
03:50:57.149 --> 03:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
that go ahead good afternoon this is
 
03:51:02.070 --> 03:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
Susan Carlson speaking um yes um the
 
03:51:05.469 --> 03:51:05.479 align:start position:0%
what I refer to is the haircut we got on
 
03:51:07.590 --> 03:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
our um clean water and drinking water
 
03:51:12.149 --> 03:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
srf grants um what it does is it will
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
delay our requests to to
 
03:51:20.790 --> 03:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
um get the FY 23 Federal grant money in
 
03:51:26.990 --> 03:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
the door until July of of State fiscal
 
03:51:27.000 --> 03:51:27.870 align:start position:0%
the door until July of of State fiscal
year

03:51:27.870 --> 03:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
24 so it what it does it delays our
 
03:51:34.790 --> 03:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
ability to get that Year's Grant but it
 
03:51:38.189 --> 03:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't eliminate our ability to get
 
03:51:41.910 --> 03:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:45.149 --> 03:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
help okay if if you're asking me I well
 
03:51:48.070 --> 03:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
I assume that the uh uh Mr chairman if I
 
03:51:49.830 --> 03:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
can continue
 
03:51:53.469 --> 03:51:53.479 align:start position:0%
y um I assume you're going to be able
 
03:51:55.590 --> 03:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
get able to get the request in but is it
 
03:51:58.070 --> 03:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
just going to be
 
03:52:02.429 --> 03:52:02.439 align:start position:0%
less um what is going to happen is
 
03:52:05.590 --> 03:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
because the federal government is a
 
03:52:08.950 --> 03:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
little behind in their
 
03:52:12.590 --> 03:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
budgets we live on a time frame when
 
03:52:14.790 --> 03:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
they announced that we can apply apply
 
03:52:18.110 --> 03:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
for the awards once they announce that
 
03:52:21.149 --> 03:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
um application period we only have a set
 
03:52:23.670 --> 03:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
number of months to file the
 
03:52:27.149 --> 03:52:27.159 align:start position:0%
application so what we will end up doing
 
03:52:30.870 --> 03:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
is if we have insufficient funds let me
 
03:52:33.469 --> 03:52:33.479 align:start position:0%
give you an example let's say they're
 
03:52:35.510 --> 03:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
willing to the formula says they're
 
03:52:38.710 --> 03:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
willing to award us $15 million and we
 
03:52:41.870 --> 03:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
don't have enough match money on the
 
03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
books to match the 15 we can either do
 
03:52:46.870 --> 03:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
one of two things we can either apply
 
03:52:49.429 --> 03:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
for less than the 15 million and apply
 
03:52:53.189 --> 03:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
only for what we have match for or we
 
03:52:53.199 --> 03:52:54.229 align:start position:0%
only for what we have match for or we
can

03:52:54.229 --> 03:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:52:58.670 --> 03:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
delay the application until we receive a
 
03:53:01.510 --> 03:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
second capital appropriation in the next
 
03:53:04.950 --> 03:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
biennium and apply for the full
 
03:53:08.110 --> 03:53:08.120 align:start position:0%
15 so we will do what whatever it is
 
03:53:10.389 --> 03:53:10.399 align:start position:0%
possible for us to do in order to get
 
03:53:13.950 --> 03:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
the maximum money we can from the srf
 
03:53:13.960 --> 03:53:16.070 align:start position:0%
the maximum money we can from the srf
program

03:53:16.070 --> 03:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:53:18.550 --> 03:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
and if I could Su sue if you could uh
 
03:53:21.550 --> 03:53:21.560 align:start position:0%
tell me if I'm correct this type of EB
 
03:53:23.870 --> 03:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
and flow you know small amount of
 
03:53:26.189 --> 03:53:26.199 align:start position:0%
changes in the match is not you know if
 
03:53:28.750 --> 03:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
you look historically that's sometimes
 
03:53:30.790 --> 03:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
it's less sometimes we end up making up
 
03:53:32.910 --> 03:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately we have to make up for it uh
 
03:53:35.389 --> 03:53:35.399 align:start position:0%
in the future budgets uh so that's not
 
03:53:37.389 --> 03:53:37.399 align:start position:0%
totally unheard of what we what what
 
03:53:39.510 --> 03:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
we're seeing today correct yeah the
 
03:53:42.149 --> 03:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner is absolutely correct when
 
03:53:44.510 --> 03:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
we submit these capital budget requests
 
03:53:46.590 --> 03:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
we estimate what the federal we think
 
03:53:48.269 --> 03:53:48.279 align:start position:0%
the Federal grant award is going to be
 
03:53:50.269 --> 03:53:50.279 align:start position:0%
for us for the next two
 
03:53:54.550 --> 03:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
years um sometimes like we have um right
 
03:53:58.950 --> 03:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
now we estimated low for fy21 and
 
03:54:01.349 --> 03:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
22 um excuse me for
 
03:54:06.110 --> 03:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
2021 so um approximately $2 million of
 
03:54:08.550 --> 03:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
this request for
 
03:54:12.429 --> 03:54:12.439 align:start position:0%
2223 is to allow us to get the federal
 
03:54:15.110 --> 03:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 Grant in the
 
03:54:19.349 --> 03:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
door once this is approved we have um if
 
03:54:21.510 --> 03:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
this capital budget is approved by June
 
03:54:25.710 --> 03:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
30th on July 1 we will apply for the
 
03:54:29.550 --> 03:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
fy21 grant of $15.8
 
03:54:33.030 --> 03:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
million and um and we will be in the
 
03:54:35.870 --> 03:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
last three months of the application
 
03:54:38.830 --> 03:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
period that allows us to apply for these
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
funds other years we have done this um
 
03:54:45.710 --> 03:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
we have overestimated Grant request and
 
03:54:48.750 --> 03:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
ended up cutting back on our grant
 
03:54:51.630 --> 03:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
Awards um our history of capital
 
03:54:53.710 --> 03:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
Appropriations as the commissioner said
 
03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
has ebed and flowed depending on you
 
03:54:59.429 --> 03:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
know what we are given for
 
03:55:02.309 --> 03:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for match one of the
 
03:55:04.469 --> 03:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
things that you should be aware of is
 
03:55:06.070 --> 03:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
that the federal government does not
 
03:55:08.790 --> 03:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
allow us to even apply for the funds
 
03:55:12.870 --> 03:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:15.950 --> 03:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
books okay uh thank you uh Mr chairman
 
03:55:17.830 --> 03:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
can I ask one more
 
03:55:21.189 --> 03:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
question um on the slide that's right in
 
03:55:23.389 --> 03:55:23.399 align:start position:0%
front of us number six is the water
 
03:55:25.149 --> 03:55:25.159 align:start position:0%
quality and coastal
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
flooding um there was no explanation of
 
03:55:29.630 --> 03:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
that in in the book because you didn't
 
03:55:31.349 --> 03:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
you know put it in could you explain
 
03:55:32.550 --> 03:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
that a little bit
 
03:55:36.750 --> 03:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
please certainly so uh the items in
 
03:55:40.630 --> 03:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
there were a new database uh $150,000
 
03:55:43.189 --> 03:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
for new database uh for our limnology
 
03:55:43.199 --> 03:55:44.870 align:start position:0%
for new database uh for our limnology
lab

03:55:44.870 --> 03:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
lab
 
03:55:44.880 --> 03:55:46.110 align:start position:0%
lab
uh

03:55:46.110 --> 03:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:55:50.790 --> 03:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
344,000 for uh Statewide testing for
 
03:55:53.790 --> 03:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
toxicants in fish and
 
03:55:55.830 --> 03:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
shellfish uh uh
 
03:55:58.870 --> 03:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
$53,000 for a new Mercury
 
03:56:03.630 --> 03:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
analyzer and $350,000 for uh coastal
 
03:56:06.590 --> 03:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
flooding modeling so hopefully that
 
03:56:09.950 --> 03:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully that adds up to $844,000 I
 
03:56:14.030 --> 03:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
think okay um if I could Mr chairman
 
03:56:17.510 --> 03:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
this these items um they seem like in
 
03:56:19.429 --> 03:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
some ways are fairly important with some
 
03:56:21.349 --> 03:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
of the work that's going on now with the
 
03:56:24.990 --> 03:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
coastal studies um I assume that you
 
03:56:26.389 --> 03:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
originally asked for it because you felt
 
03:56:29.149 --> 03:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
you needed it could you still use
 
03:56:31.870 --> 03:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
it uh of course yes yeah we would never
 
03:56:33.189 --> 03:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
have asked for it if we didn't feel we
 
03:56:35.269 --> 03:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
feel we needed it but that's correct so
 
03:56:37.389 --> 03:56:37.399 align:start position:0%
having said that we are not unhappy with
 
03:56:39.590 --> 03:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
the current budget requests given you
 
03:56:41.510 --> 03:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
know given the world we live in now
 
03:56:43.189 --> 03:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
we're happy to get anything to be blunt
 
03:56:47.710 --> 03:56:47.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much M commissioner if
 
03:56:50.910 --> 03:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
you or one of your staff could give us
 
03:56:53.950 --> 03:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
in writing what you just said about that
 
03:56:55.870 --> 03:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
item I think members of the committee
 
03:56:59.590 --> 03:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
would like to look at it as we begin our
 
03:57:06.950 --> 03:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:09.389 --> 03:57:09.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative
 
03:57:13.149 --> 03:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
able yes sir thank you um good afternoon
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you very much for
 
03:57:17.269 --> 03:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
being here and for all the great work
 
03:57:20.269 --> 03:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
you folks do um I have a soft spot in my
 
03:57:22.229 --> 03:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
heart for the solid waste Bureau so I
 
03:57:25.870 --> 03:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
want to give him a shout out um I have a
 
03:57:28.630 --> 03:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
couple of questions that's all right Mr
 
03:57:31.630 --> 03:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
chair the first one is just with respect
 
03:57:34.550 --> 03:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
to uh dams when you do your asset
 
03:57:37.469 --> 03:57:37.479 align:start position:0%
management do you also look at whether
 
03:57:40.870 --> 03:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
the dams um continue to be needed
 
03:57:44.229 --> 03:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
because they do cost to uh they take
 
03:57:47.950 --> 03:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
money to maintain and also in some cases
 
03:57:51.309 --> 03:57:51.319 align:start position:0%
um our water uh would be better off
 
03:57:53.670 --> 03:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
without being Dam so I just wondered if
 
03:57:56.189 --> 03:57:56.199 align:start position:0%
you could speak to that or if your Dam
 
03:57:56.199 --> 03:57:58.189 align:start position:0%
you could speak to that or if your Dam
engineer

03:57:58.189 --> 03:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
engineer
 
03:58:00.830 --> 03:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
could all right well thank you for that
 
03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh representative evil um so yeah I'll
 
03:58:07.189 --> 03:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
pass off to uh whoever wants it that
 
03:58:09.070 --> 03:58:09.080 align:start position:0%
either tomod donov or Jim Gallagher but
 
03:58:13.670 --> 03:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
I will say uh as certainly uh those two
 
03:58:16.070 --> 03:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
two on my my staff know uh that's a
 
03:58:18.070 --> 03:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
question I keep asking too right so we
 
03:58:20.870 --> 03:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
have a very large number of dams in the
 
03:58:23.870 --> 03:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
State uh collectively not all most you
 
03:58:25.830 --> 03:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
know only a minority of those are
 
03:58:29.070 --> 03:58:29.080 align:start position:0%
state-owned uh and you know a question
 
03:58:30.870 --> 03:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
is is it wouldn't it be better money
 
03:58:34.189 --> 03:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
spent to get rid of the dam than to go
 
03:58:35.429 --> 03:58:35.439 align:start position:0%
through these Cycles where you have to
 
03:58:37.469 --> 03:58:37.479 align:start position:0%
put millions of dollars in to keep them
 
03:58:39.950 --> 03:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh in the condition they need to be uh I
 
03:58:42.189 --> 03:58:42.199 align:start position:0%
will say that's easier said than done uh
 
03:58:44.070 --> 03:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
two things it cost a lot more money
 
03:58:46.550 --> 03:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
generally to remove a dam than to fix
 
03:58:49.149 --> 03:58:49.159 align:start position:0%
depending on what's going on up front
 
03:58:51.389 --> 03:58:51.399 align:start position:0%
though I I I think a case could be made
 
03:58:54.830 --> 03:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
that uh longterm is cheaper uh and of
 
03:58:56.469 --> 03:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
course the secondary issue to that is
 
03:58:59.229 --> 03:58:59.239 align:start position:0%
there are many people who for instance
 
03:59:00.790 --> 03:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know if I was lucky enough to
 
03:59:02.990 --> 03:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
have a home on that water body and you
 
03:59:04.870 --> 03:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
remove the dam and I suddenly don't have
 
03:59:07.710 --> 03:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
a home on a water body uh people get
 
03:59:09.670 --> 03:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
upset if you will so you know so those
 
03:59:12.149 --> 03:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
type of changes are controversial often
 
03:59:15.269 --> 03:59:15.279 align:start position:0%
also so uh with that I don't know Tom do
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
you want to take that or do you want Jim
 
03:59:19.149 --> 03:59:19.159 align:start position:0%
to take it sure thanks commissioner I'll
 
03:59:28.790 --> 03:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:31.630 --> 03:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
multi-author review of that Dam to see
 
03:59:33.070 --> 03:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
whether removal is a possibility
 
03:59:35.309 --> 03:59:35.319 align:start position:0%
generally you know on a large Dam like
 
03:59:38.389 --> 03:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
the one holding uh Lake op that uh
 
03:59:40.110 --> 03:59:40.120 align:start position:0%
representative Maki mentioned obviously
 
03:59:42.429 --> 03:59:42.439 align:start position:0%
that's not an option but in many cases
 
03:59:45.469 --> 03:59:45.479 align:start position:0%
out of the 27 plus that we own it is
 
03:59:47.030 --> 03:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
something to be very seriously
 
03:59:49.189 --> 03:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
considered we look at we do have a very
 
03:59:51.469 --> 03:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
successful relative both regionally and
 
03:59:53.429 --> 03:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
nationally dam removal program we're
 
03:59:56.630 --> 03:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
averaging about one a year or so and
 
03:59:58.429 --> 03:59:58.439 align:start position:0%
some of them have been enormous success
 
04:00:01.750 --> 04:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
stories like uh
 
04:00:05.950 --> 04:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
um salmon Mills uh removal that involved
 
04:00:08.830 --> 04:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
uh almost 15 years of work to get two
 
04:00:10.590 --> 04:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
dams out that were integrated into a
 
04:00:13.590 --> 04:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
mill complex and uh has now resulted in
 
04:00:16.070 --> 04:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
subst anal improvements to those Waters
 
04:00:18.349 --> 04:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
so there there's a short answer that
 
04:00:20.790 --> 04:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
involves both water quality water
 
04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
biology and the dams
 
04:00:26.070 --> 04:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
themselves and and if I could could add
 
04:00:27.429 --> 04:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
my name is Jim Gallagher and I'm chief
 
04:00:29.309 --> 04:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
of the dam Bureau we do do that
 
04:00:32.349 --> 04:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
evaluation we're faced with with any
 
04:00:34.469 --> 04:00:34.479 align:start position:0%
either any repair project any project
 
04:00:36.950 --> 04:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be repaired we also look at
 
04:00:38.790 --> 04:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
that option of removal and we have
 
04:00:41.030 --> 04:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
removed some state owned dams in the
 
04:00:43.990 --> 04:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
past 15 years uh bunker Pond and eing
 
04:00:46.269 --> 04:00:46.279 align:start position:0%
was removed did have a couple homes on
 
04:00:48.910 --> 04:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
it but they got flooded during the 2005
 
04:00:50.830 --> 04:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
and 2006 floods and they were glad to
 
04:00:53.510 --> 04:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
have that out because the impartment
 
04:00:55.510 --> 04:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
itself uh caused flooding on their
 
04:00:58.670 --> 04:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
property uh the buck Street Dam in
 
04:01:02.269 --> 04:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
Allenstown in Pembroke uh was another
 
04:01:05.110 --> 04:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
Dam that we a state-owned dam that uh we
 
04:01:08.149 --> 04:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
removed and it would certainly be a
 
04:01:09.830 --> 04:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
component of the asset management plan
 
04:01:12.030 --> 04:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
is take a look at how Dam that don't
 
04:01:14.429 --> 04:01:14.439 align:start position:0%
serve any useful purpose
 
04:01:16.510 --> 04:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
um as candidates for removal because the
 
04:01:19.630 --> 04:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
life cycle costs of removing these dams
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
are uh less than the life cycle cost of
 
04:01:24.510 --> 04:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
maintaining them and I just also want to
 
04:01:26.830 --> 04:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
point out that one of the items one of
 
04:01:30.110 --> 04:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
specific line items was to look at the
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
dams on the Mary meing River and these
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
are three fishing game dams this Mary
 
04:01:38.590 --> 04:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
meeing lake is one Jones Pond which is
 
04:01:38.600 --> 04:01:39.510 align:start position:0%
meeing lake is one Jones Pond which is
just

04:01:39.510 --> 04:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:01:42.030 --> 04:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
Downstream is another and the third is
 
04:01:43.990 --> 04:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
what we call Alton power Dam I used to
 
04:01:46.030 --> 04:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
have a power component to it all these
 
04:01:49.349 --> 04:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
STS R by fishing game and in that
 
04:01:50.910 --> 04:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation that we're going to be doing
 
04:01:54.070 --> 04:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
is be looking at uh the feasibility of
 
04:01:57.429 --> 04:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
removing one or two of them you know I
 
04:01:59.189 --> 04:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
don't think we'll be moving removing
 
04:02:01.670 --> 04:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
Mary meing Lake for the for the uh
 
04:02:03.950 --> 04:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
reasons the director said it's you has a
 
04:02:06.269 --> 04:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
huge Recreation component it's also the
 
04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
water source for the for the Hatchery uh
 
04:02:12.349 --> 04:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
but Jones Pawn in particular cannot meet
 
04:02:14.670 --> 04:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
damp safety standards and that would be
 
04:02:16.990 --> 04:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
a good candidate for removal but is as
 
04:02:19.590 --> 04:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
the the director pointed out you know
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
there are um uh issues we wouldd have to
 
04:02:24.309 --> 04:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
address with the community uh but that
 
04:02:26.550 --> 04:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
would be part of that evaluation for
 
04:02:30.189 --> 04:02:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:33.550 --> 04:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
dams thank you very much um I have
 
04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
another question Mr chairman if that's
 
04:02:39.910 --> 04:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
all right yes go ahead thank you um
 
04:02:45.550 --> 04:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
could so in the last budget uh cycle or
 
04:02:51.070 --> 04:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
this $50 million was uh you know allowed
 
04:02:55.389 --> 04:02:55.399 align:start position:0%
for bonding for pasas
 
04:02:57.950 --> 04:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
matters which made us uh you know of
 
04:02:59.550 --> 04:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
course we always watch our bonding
 
04:03:02.149 --> 04:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
levels could you explain a little bit
 
04:03:05.590 --> 04:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
more to the committee about that because
 
04:03:07.830 --> 04:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
um we weren't really involved in the
 
04:03:10.670 --> 04:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
discussions and you can say a little bit
 
04:03:12.750 --> 04:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
about it I think it would be helpful for
 
04:03:15.670 --> 04:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
us sure thank you representative and
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
again I'll I'll give her couple minute
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
warning that I'll I'll probably hand off
 
04:03:22.670 --> 04:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
to sue Carlson again uh so yes so there
 
04:03:27.269 --> 04:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
was last bium there was a a bill passed
 
04:03:29.670 --> 04:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh to Grant a bonding of up to $50
 
04:03:35.309 --> 04:03:35.319 align:start position:0%
million for uh the department to run a
 
04:03:41.030 --> 04:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh a Loan Fund uh for uh regarding water
 
04:03:44.030 --> 04:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
system impacts due to uh past contain
 
04:03:46.870 --> 04:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
mination uh so we have rules that are
 
04:03:50.990 --> 04:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
recently prated on that uh we do have a
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
couple request just uh recently came in
 
04:03:57.670 --> 04:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh to to utilize that that uh new
 
04:04:00.110 --> 04:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
program uh for the bonding and that's
 
04:04:02.070 --> 04:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
what I'll ask to Carlson about uh the
 
04:04:04.030 --> 04:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
bonding itself actually hasn't happened
 
04:04:05.750 --> 04:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
yet and I think it's important for the
 
04:04:08.389 --> 04:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
committee to understand obviously a lot
 
04:04:10.269 --> 04:04:10.279 align:start position:0%
of discussion on that bill was on bond
 
04:04:12.510 --> 04:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
rating and the the state treasurer was
 
04:04:13.710 --> 04:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
was involved in those discussion
 
04:04:18.389 --> 04:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
questions also uh the we don't see so
 
04:04:21.030 --> 04:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
far no bonding has happened for that uh
 
04:04:24.630 --> 04:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
and to the extent it does uh it's not it
 
04:04:26.550 --> 04:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a $50 million Bond it would
 
04:04:29.910 --> 04:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
be to cover uh as as this program moves
 
04:04:32.510 --> 04:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
forward so so so if you could add a
 
04:04:36.590 --> 04:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
little bit more texture to that yes uh
 
04:04:40.229 --> 04:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me yeah the um the bill that was
 
04:04:43.110 --> 04:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
passed last year obviously allows um the
 
04:04:46.429 --> 04:04:46.439 align:start position:0%
state Bond $50 million for the P Loan
 
04:04:49.030 --> 04:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
program we have worked very closely with
 
04:04:51.990 --> 04:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
the state treasurers office and and the
 
04:04:54.429 --> 04:04:54.439 align:start position:0%
state controller and determining how to
 
04:04:57.349 --> 04:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
do that bonding the decision has been
 
04:05:02.710 --> 04:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
made that um they will bond um as they
 
04:05:05.790 --> 04:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
do every other Capital project which is
 
04:05:07.950 --> 04:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
we tend to bond the state bonds after
 
04:05:10.870 --> 04:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
the fact so after we have spent the
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
dollars they will then Bond um whatever
 
04:05:15.950 --> 04:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
portion that we have spent of our 50
 
04:05:20.110 --> 04:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
million cap for that also just for your
 
04:05:20.120 --> 04:05:21.670 align:start position:0%
million cap for that also just for your
um

04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
own um excuse me excuse me knowledge is
 
04:05:30.550 --> 04:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
built into that statute is um a section
 
04:05:34.830 --> 04:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
that says if and when we have a lawsuit
 
04:05:37.469 --> 04:05:37.479 align:start position:0%
against the manufacturers of Pas and if
 
04:05:41.389 --> 04:05:41.399 align:start position:0%
and when the state is successful in that
 
04:05:43.630 --> 04:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
lawsuit then the state will be re
 
04:05:45.910 --> 04:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
reimburse for any cost associated with
 
04:05:45.920 --> 04:05:50.070 align:start position:0%
reimburse for any cost associated with
the

04:05:50.070 --> 04:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:54.269 --> 04:05:54.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:59.030 --> 04:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
much thank you any other questions for
 
04:06:04.750 --> 04:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:08.670 --> 04:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner on the uh dams that you
 
04:06:11.189 --> 04:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
intend to work on is that your priority
 
04:06:14.309 --> 04:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
list or is just a list of the dams you
 
04:06:15.510 --> 04:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
hope to get
 
04:06:18.750 --> 04:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
to I I I will again if Jim Gallagher can
 
04:06:20.510 --> 04:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong it's it's not a
 
04:06:24.710 --> 04:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
priy list per se uh and and you'll note
 
04:06:27.510 --> 04:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
that I I believe it's a footnote too uh
 
04:06:30.189 --> 04:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
that you know heaven forbid for instance
 
04:06:32.830 --> 04:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
pick any one of these if if it happened
 
04:06:34.830 --> 04:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
to be the sunset dam was our party at
 
04:06:37.670 --> 04:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
the moment but the Jones pwn Dam have we
 
04:06:40.110 --> 04:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
looked at it was you know an eminent
 
04:06:43.110 --> 04:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
threat to to life and property you know
 
04:06:45.510 --> 04:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
we would we readjust our priorities if
 
04:06:47.790 --> 04:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
you will uh on the Fly for obvious
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
reasons so uh Jim can you add to any of
 
04:06:53.229 --> 04:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
that or did I get close enough that
 
04:06:55.149 --> 04:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely correct commissioner
 
04:06:57.710 --> 04:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
um this is a group that um certainly has
 
04:06:59.710 --> 04:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
a priority now based on their condition
 
04:07:02.870 --> 04:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
in in uh in terms of the our entire
 
04:07:05.710 --> 04:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
inventory 274 state owned dams but just
 
04:07:09.269 --> 04:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner has said um uh we've
 
04:07:11.590 --> 04:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
had the experience before where a damn
 
04:07:14.349 --> 04:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
that's not even on this list has uh
 
04:07:17.389 --> 04:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
developed um a a problem that needed to
 
04:07:20.990 --> 04:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
be addressed mum's pond in barington was
 
04:07:24.590 --> 04:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
such an example where we uh had a you
 
04:07:26.109 --> 04:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
know couple three dams that we were
 
04:07:28.469 --> 04:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
going to be getting at at that bium but
 
04:07:31.710 --> 04:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
that uh that dam was showing real signs
 
04:07:33.870 --> 04:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
of distress seat page was flowing
 
04:07:35.429 --> 04:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
through the dam and carrying material
 
04:07:38.550 --> 04:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
out of in the interior of the dam and so
 
04:07:41.670 --> 04:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
we had to redirect our work to address
 
04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
that very important Dam that high hat as
 
04:07:46.630 --> 04:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
a dam uh was also important recreational
 
04:07:49.510 --> 04:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
resource unh's uh Recreation areas on
 
04:07:51.269 --> 04:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
there as well as a number of other
 
04:07:53.790 --> 04:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
residences so that happens and we've had
 
04:07:57.269 --> 04:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
a footnote on our capital budget which
 
04:08:00.349 --> 04:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
allows us to do that to rep prioritize
 
04:08:05.750 --> 04:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:09.269 --> 04:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
arises thank you um and you mentioned
 
04:08:10.870 --> 04:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
that three of the dams that you were
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
looking at um are owned by a different
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
agency um are you going to get money
 
04:08:18.990 --> 04:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
from them for the work or are we going
 
04:08:24.149 --> 04:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
BLS we have been doing work on fishing
 
04:08:31.229 --> 04:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
game dams um uh taking respons we have
 
04:08:32.670 --> 04:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
daily operation and maintenance
 
04:08:34.349 --> 04:08:34.359 align:start position:0%

Department of Natural and cultural
 
04:08:40.510 --> 04:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
resources they have their own dams and
 
04:08:42.630 --> 04:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
work that we do is largely funded by
 
04:08:44.309 --> 04:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
those agencies
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
but in most cases not all cases but most
 
04:08:50.790 --> 04:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
cases uh the work done on some fishing
 
04:08:52.710 --> 04:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
game dams are done under our capital

04:14:35.189 --> 04:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
there or virtually here but regardless I
 
04:14:37.510 --> 04:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
am here uh for those who I haven't had
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
the pleasure of meeting my name is Helen
 
04:14:41.870 --> 04:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
Hanks I am the commissioner of the
 
04:14:43.950 --> 04:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and the green
 
04:14:46.389 --> 04:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
shirt and tie behind me is Jonathan
 
04:14:48.910 --> 04:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
Hansen our administrative Logistics we
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
help co- facilitate this
 
04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
presentation I'm gonna attempt to share
 
04:15:00.389 --> 04:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:07.070 --> 04:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:09.870 --> 04:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
fantastic job well done on first slide
 
04:15:11.790 --> 04:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
moving on we are the Department of
 
04:15:16.750 --> 04:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:19.229 --> 04:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
presentation you'll see we tried to show
 
04:15:21.750 --> 04:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
you what was proposed in the governor's
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh portion of the capital budget and
 
04:15:25.229 --> 04:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
then the other projects that were not
 
04:15:27.510 --> 04:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
included in the proposed funding to help
 
04:15:30.070 --> 04:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
give an overall ask of what the agency
 
04:15:32.630 --> 04:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
was projecting for
 
04:15:34.750 --> 04:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
need uh at this point I'm going to let
 
04:15:37.189 --> 04:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
John Hansen go into the detail slides
 
04:15:38.910 --> 04:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
and help support him along the way but
 
04:15:40.670 --> 04:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
he doesn't usually need much support and
 
04:15:49.870 --> 04:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:51.870 --> 04:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:15:53.870 --> 04:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner good afternoon committee
 
04:15:56.229 --> 04:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman um on the
 
04:15:58.990 --> 04:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
first slide you'll see that we have a
 
04:16:00.750 --> 04:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
project to replace the existing Air
 
04:16:03.389 --> 04:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
Handlers and duct work installed in the
 
04:16:08.790 --> 04:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
medium custody North and South give ah
 
04:16:10.910 --> 04:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
oh there's your mouse
 
04:16:12.710 --> 04:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
sorry I thought I was doing on the other
 
04:16:12.720 --> 04:16:13.910 align:start position:0%
sorry I thought I was doing on the other
screen

04:16:13.910 --> 04:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
screen
 
04:16:16.189 --> 04:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
um in that slide you're going to see the
 
04:16:17.870 --> 04:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
duct work in the medium custy north
 
04:16:19.590 --> 04:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
south unit within the New Hampshire
 
04:16:21.590 --> 04:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
state prison and conquered um that's
 
04:16:24.109 --> 04:16:24.119 align:start position:0%
rusted and decayed to the point where
 
04:16:25.550 --> 04:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's actually fallen down in the
 
04:16:27.910 --> 04:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
chaseway um this unit was built for
 
04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
actually um we have two of them
 
04:16:32.830 --> 04:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
identical 285 inmates total we're
 
04:16:34.670 --> 04:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
currently popul when the population's up
 
04:16:37.030 --> 04:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
we're housing 570 people in there so
 
04:16:40.189 --> 04:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
these air handles running constant 247
 
04:16:43.309 --> 04:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
365 since 1983
 
04:16:45.109 --> 04:16:45.119 align:start position:0%
the duct work is put in a Chase Way
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
which is also where the plumbing and
 
04:16:48.790 --> 04:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
some other materials are and that's why
 
04:16:51.109 --> 04:16:51.119 align:start position:0%
it's created some corrosion the way that
 
04:16:53.550 --> 04:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
you see there so we are asking for this
 
04:16:57.510 --> 04:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
money to redo the entire HVAC system uh
 
04:16:59.189 --> 04:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
the heating and venting duct work in the
 
04:17:02.550 --> 04:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:06.790 --> 04:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:09.149 --> 04:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
set that was actually priority number
 
04:17:10.830 --> 04:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
two for us on the governor is priority
 
04:17:13.109 --> 04:17:13.119 align:start position:0%
number one number two Governor's uh
 
04:17:15.309 --> 04:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
priority number two this project is to
 
04:17:17.710 --> 04:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
replace three cleav Brooks 350
 
04:17:20.149 --> 04:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
horsepower boilers originally installed
 
04:17:23.109 --> 04:17:23.119 align:start position:0%
in the big Renovations in 1983 these are
 
04:17:24.710 --> 04:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
large boilers that typically typically
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
have a life expectancy of approximately
 
04:17:30.349 --> 04:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
30 years we've gotten 39 to 40 years out
 
04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
of them um we've been able to keep these
 
04:17:36.990 --> 04:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
operational but they run again
 
04:17:41.229 --> 04:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
365 247 365 to supply Steam for the
 
04:17:43.229 --> 04:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
laundry and the kitchen operations we do
 
04:17:45.389 --> 04:17:45.399 align:start position:0%
not shut these boilers down in the
 
04:17:47.070 --> 04:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
winter time they go to High fire and
 
04:17:49.469 --> 04:17:49.479 align:start position:0%
Supply heat for the entire facility of
 
04:17:51.990 --> 04:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 400,000 square
 
04:17:55.229 --> 04:17:55.239 align:start position:0%
feet this project will decrease the
 
04:18:00.670 --> 04:18:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:02.670 --> 04:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
boilers the next one down the list
 
04:18:04.109 --> 04:18:04.119 align:start position:0%
Governor number three are number five
 
04:18:06.590 --> 04:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
this is the existing door control
 
04:18:08.830 --> 04:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
systems of programmable programmable
 
04:18:11.429 --> 04:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
logic controllers at ncf they have
 
04:18:13.349 --> 04:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
reached their life expectancy
 
04:18:16.030 --> 04:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
and by 2022 there will no they will be
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
needed to be replaced and we will no
 
04:18:20.030 --> 04:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
longer be able to get the parts that we
 
04:18:22.590 --> 04:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
need to operate that system and a modern
 
04:18:24.149 --> 04:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
system will use a different type of
 
04:18:26.109 --> 04:18:26.119 align:start position:0%
electronics and it will decrease the
 
04:18:30.630 --> 04:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:33.550 --> 04:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
consumption project number four um for
 
04:18:35.189 --> 04:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
those of you familiar the front part of
 
04:18:38.109 --> 04:18:38.119 align:start position:0%
the prison was built in 1878 we utilize
 
04:18:41.630 --> 04:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
the North and the South wings as areas
 
04:18:43.229 --> 04:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
for education
 
04:18:46.870 --> 04:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
for medical Etc there are heater coils
 
04:18:48.830 --> 04:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
these are old copper type heater Co
 
04:18:51.630 --> 04:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
coils and aluminum they're beyond repair
 
04:18:53.389 --> 04:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
and leak into the South wings of the of
 
04:18:55.710 --> 04:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
the facility the department is currently
 
04:18:58.109 --> 04:18:58.119 align:start position:0%
soldering the leaks as they appear and
 
04:18:59.670 --> 04:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
we're diver diverting water through
 
04:19:02.109 --> 04:19:02.119 align:start position:0%
normal drip pans and drains but this
 
04:19:03.910 --> 04:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
stop Gap measure will eventually become
 
04:19:06.510 --> 04:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
ineffective and has already this project
 
04:19:11.309 --> 04:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:14.830 --> 04:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
consumption next project uh our project
 
04:19:17.429 --> 04:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
number one Governor number five this is
 
04:19:19.269 --> 04:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
the perimeter detection systems at the
 
04:19:21.189 --> 04:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
northern Correctional Facility in Berlin
 
04:19:22.990 --> 04:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
it's now 21 years old and needs
 
04:19:24.990 --> 04:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
continuous upgrades to remain fully
 
04:19:27.030 --> 04:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
functional the existing detection
 
04:19:30.030 --> 04:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
systems uses outdated Technologies
 
04:19:31.189 --> 04:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
difficult to maintain as they are
 
04:19:33.870 --> 04:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
located in fenced areas with razor wire
 
04:19:35.189 --> 04:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
the drainage systems that were part of
 
04:19:37.030 --> 04:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
the original fence detection systems now
 
04:19:39.469 --> 04:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
have sunken created sink holes around
 
04:19:41.309 --> 04:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
the secure perimeter that have required
 
04:19:43.790 --> 04:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
the doc to fill them in with will fill
 
04:19:46.349 --> 04:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
but only as a temporary fix in order to
 
04:19:48.109 --> 04:19:48.119 align:start position:0%
M maintain All Those sensors the
 
04:19:50.109 --> 04:19:50.119 align:start position:0%
drainage systems need to be rebuilt and
 
04:19:52.670 --> 04:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
the security fence system reset into a
 
04:19:55.109 --> 04:19:55.119 align:start position:0%
dig barrier this project with the new
 
04:19:57.070 --> 04:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
technology will decrease the state's
 
04:19:57.080 --> 04:20:00.670 align:start position:0%
technology will decrease the state's
utility

04:20:00.670 --> 04:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:03.189 --> 04:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
consumption down the line You'll see a
 
04:20:05.990 --> 04:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
picture here of what's called a it's a
 
04:20:08.349 --> 04:20:08.359 align:start position:0%
muffin Monster uh or a sewer grinder
 
04:20:10.590 --> 04:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
muffin monster is the brand name that
 
04:20:12.030 --> 04:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
actually this is a request by this city
 
04:20:13.149 --> 04:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
of conquered
 
04:20:16.950 --> 04:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
this was a temporary uh location put in
 
04:20:20.229 --> 04:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
1982 to put this actually almost within
 
04:20:22.149 --> 04:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
Maguire Street which is the road leading
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
down to the old conquered electric and
 
04:20:28.670 --> 04:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
um that area towards the U Smoke Stack
 
04:20:31.550 --> 04:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
buildings so they've requested that we
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
relocate this into a heated building and
 
04:20:35.309 --> 04:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
add an augur that's typical for an
 
04:20:36.950 --> 04:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
operation like us because there a number
 
04:20:39.149 --> 04:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
of things that could flush down the
 
04:20:42.269 --> 04:20:42.279 align:start position:0%
system and all of that ends up going to
 
04:20:44.189 --> 04:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
Hall Street which is a wastewater
 
04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
treatment plant unless we stop it so the
 
04:20:48.630 --> 04:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
project will combine three sewer lines
 
04:20:50.070 --> 04:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
leading from the conquered prison into
 
04:20:52.109 --> 04:20:52.119 align:start position:0%
one line making it more efficient and
 
04:20:54.229 --> 04:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of plug UPS within
 
04:20:56.670 --> 04:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
their sewer lines this project will no
 
04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:09.349 --> 04:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
consumption and we are down
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:21:13.830 --> 04:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
roofs the roofs on the Hancock and the
 
04:21:15.469 --> 04:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
industries building as you can see from
 
04:21:17.910 --> 04:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
an aerial slide there those have begun
 
04:21:19.710 --> 04:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
to leak these are 30 years old and are
 
04:21:23.790 --> 04:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
need of replacement um we use a 30-year
 
04:21:26.550 --> 04:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
roof now which is warranteed and this is
 
04:21:28.309 --> 04:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
obviously going to be what's going to be
 
04:21:30.910 --> 04:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
replaced here this should have no effect
 
04:21:32.389 --> 04:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
on the state's utility consumption
 
04:21:34.590 --> 04:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
unless we're able to add some hard
 
04:21:37.710 --> 04:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
insulation uh board to those
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
roofs so those are in fact the the eight
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
that were in the cap budget that the
 
04:21:43.680 --> 04:21:44.630 align:start position:0%
that were in the cap budget that the
governor

04:21:44.630 --> 04:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
governor
 
04:21:46.630 --> 04:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
produced uh commissioner do you want me
 
04:21:49.910 --> 04:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
to continue with the remaining ones I I
 
04:21:53.030 --> 04:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
would prefer that we stop for a minute
 
04:21:56.349 --> 04:21:56.359 align:start position:0%
and ask if any of the members have
 
04:21:59.630 --> 04:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
questions on the projects that were
 
04:22:03.149 --> 04:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
proposed in the governor's um Capital
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
Improvement Plan before we move on to
 
04:22:10.750 --> 04:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
additional asks from from the Department
 
04:22:15.149 --> 04:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:19.349 --> 04:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
Newman yes thank you um I'm concerned on
 
04:22:22.229 --> 04:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
the let me see on the perimeter security
 
04:22:25.269 --> 04:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
that got bounced to number five from the
 
04:22:27.469 --> 04:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
governor's office and you had it as
 
04:22:29.910 --> 04:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
number one could could you just give me
 
04:22:33.510 --> 04:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
some background to help me understand um
 
04:22:36.630 --> 04:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
why you had it as one but apparently it
 
04:22:39.309 --> 04:22:39.319 align:start position:0%
did not get sold to the governor is
 
04:22:42.950 --> 04:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
there sure so that's a perimet security
 
04:22:44.469 --> 04:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
that comes with the initial facility
 
04:22:47.229 --> 04:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
that was completed in 2000 what we found
 
04:22:48.710 --> 04:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
over the last five or six years is a
 
04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
number of components in that system
 
04:22:53.070 --> 04:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
which failed it has a very old computer
 
04:22:55.469 --> 04:22:55.479 align:start position:0%
connectivity back to the fence line
 
04:22:57.910 --> 04:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
itself and then beyond that we had these
 
04:22:59.990 --> 04:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
unsuspected sink holes along the edge of
 
04:23:02.070 --> 04:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
the perimeter fence which was double
 
04:23:04.429 --> 04:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
whammy because now only not only can we
 
04:23:06.109 --> 04:23:06.119 align:start position:0%
not detect it but we have places where
 
04:23:09.870 --> 04:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
there's voids the good news is uh as you
 
04:23:11.870 --> 04:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
can probably imagine our own forces our
 
04:23:13.710 --> 04:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
own electron shops and our own
 
04:23:16.030 --> 04:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance techs are constantly staying
 
04:23:17.590 --> 04:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
on top of this we have a perimeter
 
04:23:19.429 --> 04:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
security patrol around the building all
 
04:23:23.149 --> 04:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
night long 247 so we we're confident
 
04:23:25.830 --> 04:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
that we have a a system in place but
 
04:23:27.910 --> 04:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
clearly we need to upgrade that and
 
04:23:29.590 --> 04:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's why that was number
 
04:23:32.309 --> 04:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
one and representative Newman I don't
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
think it would be fair to ask the
 
04:23:37.229 --> 04:23:37.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner or any of her staff to try
 
04:23:41.070 --> 04:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
to guess why the governor would move
 
04:23:43.950 --> 04:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
things around in a priority list um they
 
04:23:46.469 --> 04:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
do work for him so I wouldn't ask him to
 
04:23:46.479 --> 04:23:48.670 align:start position:0%
do work for him so I wouldn't ask him to
do

04:23:48.670 --> 04:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:23:52.670 --> 04:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
that all right I I just was concerned
 
04:23:57.550 --> 04:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:05.670 --> 04:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:08.830 --> 04:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
evil there there yes I'm here I'm I have
 
04:24:10.710 --> 04:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
so many things I have to do at once I
 
04:24:13.189 --> 04:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
wondered if I could um you could talk to
 
04:24:17.670 --> 04:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
us about the HVAC system and if it is I
 
04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
mean it almost looks like it's not
 
04:24:21.630 --> 04:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
functioning very well and we've heard so
 
04:24:25.469 --> 04:24:25.479 align:start position:0%
much about uh HVAC and
 
04:24:25.479 --> 04:24:27.550 align:start position:0%
much about uh HVAC and
covid

04:24:27.550 --> 04:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
covid
 
04:24:30.990 --> 04:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
and anyway whatever you thank you
 
04:24:33.510 --> 04:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative AEL uh so this item has
 
04:24:35.870 --> 04:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
been before uh the committee in the past
 
04:24:39.070 --> 04:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
it it does not surprise me that it's at
 
04:24:40.510 --> 04:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
least on the list to representative
 
04:24:43.149 --> 04:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
Newman's question um and yes we were
 
04:24:45.870 --> 04:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
mindful because of covid we had a a
 
04:24:48.510 --> 04:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
third-party contractor come in and test
 
04:24:50.429 --> 04:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
the air quality in both of those units
 
04:24:52.990 --> 04:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
and again they they said it was still
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
livable but cautioned us that it needed
 
04:24:57.950 --> 04:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
to be replaced and so again while you're
 
04:25:00.429 --> 04:25:00.439 align:start position:0%
seeing it on the list of items that I
 
04:25:02.670 --> 04:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
would hope to see continued support for
 
04:25:05.109 --> 04:25:05.119 align:start position:0%
it would become uh problematic if it
 
04:25:07.389 --> 04:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
continues in the situation it's in
 
04:25:10.309 --> 04:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
especially in light of the covid-19
 
04:25:12.670 --> 04:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
situation and other potential uh
 
04:25:15.070 --> 04:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
Airborne infectious diseases but at this
 
04:25:17.189 --> 04:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
time uh we'll continue to use that third
 
04:25:19.950 --> 04:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
party um entity to come in and continue
 
04:25:21.790 --> 04:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
to monitor the air quality so we can
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
ensure Life Safety in those units in the
 
04:25:28.109 --> 04:25:28.119 align:start position:0%
meantime uh followup Mr chair
 
04:25:30.910 --> 04:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
certainly um I just so will it have its
 
04:25:33.429 --> 04:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
own internal filtration system or how
 
04:25:36.670 --> 04:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
will that work yes the um representative
 
04:25:39.229 --> 04:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
the the new type systems come with
 
04:25:41.349 --> 04:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
built-in filters that are much more
 
04:25:42.830 --> 04:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
robust than what was put in in the
 
04:25:45.070 --> 04:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
initial U system that we have there as a
 
04:25:47.309 --> 04:25:47.319 align:start position:0%
matter of fact those are similar to what
 
04:25:49.109 --> 04:25:49.119 align:start position:0%
filters you'd have in your household
 
04:25:51.149 --> 04:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
versus some that we have now they're 4
 
04:25:53.630 --> 04:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
inch thick they're heap of filters right
 
04:25:54.790 --> 04:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of other things that
 
04:25:56.309 --> 04:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
we'll consider during the design
 
04:25:58.910 --> 04:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
including alteration ionization and
 
04:26:00.830 --> 04:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
things like that within the within the
 
04:26:03.389 --> 04:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
system itself and I think you your your
 
04:26:04.710 --> 04:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
question is well put because we don't
 
04:26:06.389 --> 04:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
know what that next generation will be
 
04:26:09.389 --> 04:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
right now okay thank you we've learn
 
04:26:11.990 --> 04:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
learned a lot about uh mves and hipas
 
04:26:14.429 --> 04:26:14.439 align:start position:0%
and all sort
 
04:26:21.750 --> 04:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:21.760 --> 04:26:23.389 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:26:23.389 --> 04:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:26:25.670 --> 04:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
any whose hand
 
04:26:25.680 --> 04:26:27.429 align:start position:0%
any whose hand
is

04:26:27.429 --> 04:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:26:31.309 --> 04:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
Newman yes thank you on the lunch break
 
04:26:36.109 --> 04:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
I had nhpr on and I I guess ironically
 
04:26:38.030 --> 04:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
they were I I only heard part of it but
 
04:26:39.910 --> 04:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
they were talking about the prison
 
04:26:44.109 --> 04:26:44.119 align:start position:0%
system and I believe um what I heard was
 
04:26:47.670 --> 04:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
that if you have to take some reduction
 
04:26:51.070 --> 04:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
in monies coming to you that certain
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
educational programs will be cut and the
 
04:26:56.670 --> 04:26:56.680 align:start position:0%
discussion on the r Newman we're talking
 
04:26:59.269 --> 04:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
about capital budget not the operating
 
04:27:00.830 --> 04:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
budget at this
 
04:27:04.510 --> 04:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
point okay I'm my apologies I thought it
 
04:27:06.550 --> 04:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
had to do with the capital budget I'm
 
04:27:09.109 --> 04:27:09.119 align:start position:0%
sorry no and representative Newman feel
 
04:27:10.830 --> 04:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
free to email me and I will assist in
 
04:27:13.149 --> 04:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
any questions associate to the operating
 
04:27:15.590 --> 04:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
budget happy to help you there
 
04:27:19.710 --> 04:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
representative Mills thank you yes I've
 
04:27:21.830 --> 04:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
got more of a follow-up question for
 
04:27:24.189 --> 04:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
some of the older members on the
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
committee I know we finally allocated I
 
04:27:30.309 --> 04:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
believe last bium uh monies for the uh
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
deplorable conditions that were in your
 
04:27:35.870 --> 04:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
kitchen area and due to co and
 
04:27:38.510 --> 04:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
everything I just wondered has any of
 
04:27:40.630 --> 04:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
that been repaired is has that whole
 
04:27:42.670 --> 04:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
kitchen area been uh
 
04:27:46.429 --> 04:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
are been taken care of yes so uh first
 
04:27:48.630 --> 04:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for funding that and uh
 
04:27:50.229 --> 04:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
secondly it has not happened but I'll
 
04:27:52.750 --> 04:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
let uh Mr Hansen tell you where we are
 
04:27:55.349 --> 04:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
clearly some things such as Co and
 
04:27:56.950 --> 04:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
construction being slowed definitely
 
04:27:58.910 --> 04:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
interfered with that but I think we're
 
04:28:00.910 --> 04:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
headed in the right direction now yeah
 
04:28:02.790 --> 04:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
good question so that project 4.3
 
04:28:05.670 --> 04:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
million was funded um we are now in the
 
04:28:08.550 --> 04:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
final points of the of the approval to
 
04:28:11.790 --> 04:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
get a design contractor on board we have
 
04:28:13.670 --> 04:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
looked at at many designs to make sure
 
04:28:15.550 --> 04:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
we can meet budget and build the kitchen
 
04:28:17.870 --> 04:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
that we need to to do that many meals a
 
04:28:20.750 --> 04:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
day which is between 5,500 and 6,000
 
04:28:23.309 --> 04:28:23.319 align:start position:0%
meals a day so very soon you'll be
 
04:28:25.910 --> 04:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
seeing coming before GNC was actually
 
04:28:28.710 --> 04:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
scheduled to go in October um but that
 
04:28:30.630 --> 04:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
agreement for the design will make it
 
04:28:30.640 --> 04:28:32.510 align:start position:0%
agreement for the design will make it
the

04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:34.710 --> 04:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
GNC thank
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you other questions on what
 
04:28:39.229 --> 04:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
was in the
 
04:28:42.309 --> 04:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
governor's uh proposal
 
04:28:46.229 --> 04:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh chairman I'm sorry Jack thank you Mr
 
04:28:48.990 --> 04:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you commissioner uh if I
 
04:28:50.670 --> 04:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
remember the discussion on the sewer
 
04:28:54.550 --> 04:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
grinder last capital budget uh we had to
 
04:28:56.229 --> 04:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
cut it because we didn't quite have
 
04:28:58.309 --> 04:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
enough room to fit it and the city
 
04:28:59.950 --> 04:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't very happy with you and I'm glad
 
04:29:02.309 --> 04:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
to see it in there this time thank you
 
04:29:05.070 --> 04:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
for that sir your memory serves you well
 
04:29:06.309 --> 04:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
um I do want to point out to the
 
04:29:08.710 --> 04:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
committee uh I must have talked too
 
04:29:10.790 --> 04:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
highly of John he did miss one of those
 
04:29:13.630 --> 04:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
items but I I still Top Notch that was
 
04:29:15.870 --> 04:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
approved in the budget we just talk
 
04:29:17.870 --> 04:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
about item seven on the governor's list
 
04:29:20.269 --> 04:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
replacing steam lines and traps um I
 
04:29:22.710 --> 04:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to lose that part of the roll
 
04:29:25.389 --> 04:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
back to that slide I'll find that slide
 
04:29:28.269 --> 04:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
and we'll brief you on
 
04:29:30.710 --> 04:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
that thank you commissioner yes I
 
04:29:32.550 --> 04:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
slipped right by that I puted on the
 
04:29:33.910 --> 04:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
slide but I didn't know what I was
 
04:29:33.920 --> 04:29:35.550 align:start position:0%
slide but I didn't know what I was
looking

04:29:35.550 --> 04:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
looking
 
04:29:37.990 --> 04:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
at this is uh this is the governor's
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
priority number seven and our PRI
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
priority number three so this is the the
 
04:29:43.830 --> 04:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
project to make repairs to the and
 
04:29:45.389 --> 04:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
upgrades to the steam line and steam
 
04:29:48.030 --> 04:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
traps at the conquered facility in some
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
cases dat back over 80 years this
 
04:29:52.469 --> 04:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
project will not replace all the steam
 
04:29:54.670 --> 04:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
pipes and all the steam traps but will
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
ensure that the system is sustainable
 
04:29:58.950 --> 04:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
for at least the next 30 Years the Steam
 
04:30:00.590 --> 04:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
for the conquer facility runs 12 months
 
04:30:02.710 --> 04:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
of the year just as the boilers it's all
 
04:30:04.670 --> 04:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
interconnected for the kitchen laundry
 
04:30:06.790 --> 04:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
operations especially and then domestic
 
04:30:09.109 --> 04:30:09.119 align:start position:0%
hot water in the winter months the steam
 
04:30:10.670 --> 04:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
is our only source of heat for
 
04:30:13.750 --> 04:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
approximately 400,000 of building space
 
04:30:15.710 --> 04:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
many of these steam lines are old and in
 
04:30:17.030 --> 04:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
the what we call a rickw well
 
04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
manufactured pipe which is a direct
 
04:30:22.830 --> 04:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
buried metal pipe with some spot welds
 
04:30:24.670 --> 04:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
and they have lasted for many years but
 
04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
now have succumbed to the elements the
 
04:30:29.389 --> 04:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
welds have broken and a leaking badly
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
this project will decrease the state's
 
04:30:37.790 --> 04:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:42.189 --> 04:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
than any other questions on this portion
 
04:30:44.870 --> 04:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner if you would like to
 
04:30:47.469 --> 04:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
briefly go through what did not make the
 
04:30:52.590 --> 04:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
cut um we are willing to hear
 
04:30:54.790 --> 04:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
that thank you Sarah appreciate the
 
04:30:56.670 --> 04:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity assume that these are in
 
04:30:56.680 --> 04:30:57.910 align:start position:0%
opportunity assume that these are in
priority

04:30:57.910 --> 04:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
priority
 
04:31:01.510 --> 04:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
order yep if you go to uh the first
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
slide after our I'll bring it up on the
 
04:31:07.710 --> 04:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
screen we put the doc priority order 9
 
04:31:12.790 --> 04:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
through 18 um it was a continued ask uh
 
04:31:14.269 --> 04:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
and and I believe we also have those in
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
the packet correct joh correct so there
 
04:31:17.870 --> 04:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
are visuals in your packet we like to
 
04:31:19.750 --> 04:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
show visuals I think it speaks thousand
 
04:31:23.070 --> 04:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
words um this this committee's uh been
 
04:31:25.750 --> 04:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
very supportive of our door replacement
 
04:31:28.269 --> 04:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
uh project really ongoing to replace the
 
04:31:31.750 --> 04:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
doors at the Men's prison and conquered
 
04:31:34.070 --> 04:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm showing you that uh slide we
 
04:31:35.990 --> 04:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
continue to have doors that are rested
 
04:31:38.710 --> 04:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
the locks problematic uh this facility
 
04:31:40.389 --> 04:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
designed has a lot of exposure to
 
04:31:42.429 --> 04:31:42.439 align:start position:0%
outward elements that the men's Prison
 
04:31:45.670 --> 04:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
from the interior yard that ask was to
 
04:31:47.710 --> 04:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
continue to replace a certain number of
 
04:31:50.309 --> 04:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
these doors on
 
04:31:53.349 --> 04:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
campus uh priority 10 for us was to
 
04:31:55.189 --> 04:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
continue to look at again the men's
 
04:31:58.429 --> 04:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
resident conquered and cealing repairs
 
04:31:59.950 --> 04:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
um you know we tried to show you again
 
04:32:02.670 --> 04:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
that ceilings and leaks and all of um
 
04:32:05.469 --> 04:32:05.479 align:start position:0%
the different H HVAC systems and so
 
04:32:07.349 --> 04:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
forth we've already mentioned impact
 
04:32:09.630 --> 04:32:09.640 align:start position:0%
ceilings so we want to stay on top of
 
04:32:13.550 --> 04:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
those issues within the facility
 
04:32:16.030 --> 04:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
uh priority number 11 we're starting to
 
04:32:18.630 --> 04:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
explore issues off the Men's prison
 
04:32:21.229 --> 04:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
campus specifically looking over at our
 
04:32:24.030 --> 04:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
probation parole office same street a
 
04:32:25.950 --> 04:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
little further down on the right by our
 
04:32:29.269 --> 04:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
store uh but that does not have a it has
 
04:32:32.510 --> 04:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
a holding tank septic system so this
 
04:32:35.870 --> 04:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
125,000 was to put in a proper uh septic
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
system and opportunities to have a leech
 
04:32:40.670 --> 04:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
field and correct an issue that's been
 
04:32:42.790 --> 04:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
identified during my time time as
 
04:32:44.670 --> 04:32:44.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner anytime you want to chime
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
in and augment John you feel free to do
 
04:32:49.910 --> 04:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
so we're masked up over here um moving
 
04:32:52.309 --> 04:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
on to uh priority number 12 same
 
04:32:54.469 --> 04:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
location uh dealing with roofing and
 
04:32:58.229 --> 04:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
siding replacement same location again
 
04:33:00.630 --> 04:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
um I think that's simply said showing
 
04:33:02.309 --> 04:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
you imagery
 
04:33:06.269 --> 04:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
there priority 13 we do have automotive
 
04:33:08.949 --> 04:33:08.959 align:start position:0%
repair over on the Men's prison campus
 
04:33:10.910 --> 04:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
um through going through that particular
 
04:33:12.750 --> 04:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
space over the last couple of years this
 
04:33:15.109 --> 04:33:15.119 align:start position:0%
is uh an asked to fix the floor drain
 
04:33:18.070 --> 04:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
and repair some uh oil water separators
 
04:33:20.990 --> 04:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
and things of the like in that space
 
04:33:23.029 --> 04:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
this is the um auto body shop and what
 
04:33:25.029 --> 04:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
we found is as an old facility that
 
04:33:26.830 --> 04:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
actually is sitting in an area that was
 
04:33:29.830 --> 04:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
from the 1878 version of the prism right
 
04:33:32.789 --> 04:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
we we have a very old drainage system
 
04:33:34.269 --> 04:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
over there we've had a little bit of a
 
04:33:37.470 --> 04:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
scoping with some some uh materials that
 
04:33:39.390 --> 04:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
we've seen go down through the drains we
 
04:33:40.590 --> 04:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that they're
 
04:33:44.789 --> 04:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:47.869 --> 04:33:47.879 align:start position:0%
separator okay and priority 14 as
 
04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
previously presented was uh an area of
 
04:33:52.990 --> 04:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
deficit post the women's prison
 
04:33:55.310 --> 04:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
development and trying to come up with a
 
04:33:58.230 --> 04:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
trades building this is a m the
 
04:34:00.869 --> 04:34:00.879 align:start position:0%
construction John so this was uh the
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
design here is a is a standard type
 
04:34:06.070 --> 04:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
building with a pitched roof which be
 
04:34:09.150 --> 04:34:09.160 align:start position:0%
used for the woodw wood Masters and wood
 
04:34:11.109 --> 04:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
training programs so vocational programs
 
04:34:13.109 --> 04:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
at the women's prison when we modifi
 
04:34:14.390 --> 04:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
things at the women's prison we just
 
04:34:16.390 --> 04:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough room to include that
 
04:34:19.230 --> 04:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
in the main building and we do continue
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
to work on Partnerships on the
 
04:34:23.349 --> 04:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
vocational side to develop job skills
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
this is what this building would help us
 
04:34:26.590 --> 04:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
accomplish and trying to promote
 
04:34:28.109 --> 04:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
positive reintegration and reduce
 
04:34:29.750 --> 04:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
recidivism for our
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
women priority 16 clearly a northern
 
04:34:35.070 --> 04:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facility built in
 
04:34:38.590 --> 04:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
2000 and no surprise we're going to need
 
04:34:38.600 --> 04:34:39.590 align:start position:0%
2000 and no surprise we're going to need
roofs

04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
roofs
 
04:34:42.869 --> 04:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
there our job obviously in in my areas
 
04:34:44.910 --> 04:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
to monit monitor these sort of things
 
04:34:46.269 --> 04:34:46.279 align:start position:0%
we've gone up and those pictures will
 
04:34:48.670 --> 04:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
show we've done some patching on our own
 
04:34:50.990 --> 04:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
but this was prior to and as you folks
 
04:34:54.189 --> 04:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
know Mr chairman your group mandated the
 
04:34:56.269 --> 04:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
30-year roof warranty not too many years
 
04:34:59.629 --> 04:34:59.639 align:start position:0%
ago that was um obviously long after the
 
04:35:02.109 --> 04:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
the facility Berlin was built so that's
 
04:35:04.510 --> 04:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
a 20-year
 
04:35:08.750 --> 04:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
roof and then priority 16 are continued
 
04:35:11.429 --> 04:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
roofs at the Men's prison and conquered
 
04:35:13.230 --> 04:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
the roof
 
04:35:15.269 --> 04:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
Replacements that's a number of roofs
 
04:35:17.551 --> 04:35:17.561 align:start position:0%
commissioner that will be replaced a lot
 
04:35:19.310 --> 04:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
of the roofs at the conquered prison
 
04:35:21.629 --> 04:35:21.639 align:start position:0%
some of them date back a very long time
 
04:35:23.709 --> 04:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
there's some pitches and some some other
 
04:35:25.429 --> 04:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
areas that have run off we've inspected
 
04:35:27.670 --> 04:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
them all it would be quite a project and
 
04:35:29.429 --> 04:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
it will need to be done in time but that
 
04:35:32.189 --> 04:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:35.590 --> 04:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
gun and then priority 17 we've done some
 
04:35:37.029 --> 04:35:37.039 align:start position:0%
work at the northern Correctional
 
04:35:40.230 --> 04:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
Facility to correct some hbac units uh
 
04:35:42.150 --> 04:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
using our contract
 
04:35:44.109 --> 04:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
uh during covid and and those have
 
04:35:46.109 --> 04:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
mended them temporarily this is to
 
04:35:48.629 --> 04:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
really go in and and create um some
 
04:35:50.709 --> 04:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
opportunities to fix some hbac unit
 
04:35:52.349 --> 04:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
Replacements up at that North Country
 
04:35:54.750 --> 04:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
facility again we're at the 21st year of
 
04:35:58.189 --> 04:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
its um use and that use certainly wears
 
04:35:59.750 --> 04:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
on an
 
04:36:02.789 --> 04:36:02.799 align:start position:0%
institution and then priority uh 18 is
 
04:36:04.470 --> 04:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
to do some site work and
 
04:36:07.349 --> 04:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
stabilization this was the result of
 
04:36:10.230 --> 04:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
moving some land and and fill during our
 
04:36:11.949 --> 04:36:11.959 align:start position:0%
women's construction phase of by our
 
04:36:14.189 --> 04:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
training area yeah there were many many
 
04:36:17.070 --> 04:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of tons of rock
 
04:36:19.949 --> 04:36:19.959 align:start position:0%
and um overburden that was moved up onto
 
04:36:22.629 --> 04:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
the the top of the prow on the range at
 
04:36:25.230 --> 04:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
the back of the women's prison um as we
 
04:36:28.109 --> 04:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
got towards completion uh we did not
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
have enough money to do what Dees wants
 
04:36:32.470 --> 04:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
us to do and that's to put in proper
 
04:36:35.109 --> 04:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
drainage and swes we have seated in the
 
04:36:39.310 --> 04:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
LOM some of it but more needs to be
 
04:36:42.590 --> 04:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
done so that concludes what we
 
04:36:47.429 --> 04:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:51.709 --> 04:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
screen representative mcon thank you uh
 
04:36:54.590 --> 04:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
nice to see you again commissioner the U
 
04:36:56.429 --> 04:36:56.439 align:start position:0%
what was the price tag on doors and
 
04:36:59.429 --> 04:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
locks item number nine believe that was
 
04:36:59.439 --> 04:37:01.869 align:start position:0%
locks item number nine believe that was
$200,000

04:37:01.869 --> 04:37:01.879 align:start position:0%
$200,000
 
04:37:04.269 --> 04:37:04.279 align:start position:0%
sir and does that take care of your
 
04:37:07.470 --> 04:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
total problem at this time we we believe
 
04:37:09.510 --> 04:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
we'll hit the Lion Share of all doors
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
because we've already received 299 9,000
 
04:37:15.109 --> 04:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
and that project is uh it's been bid
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
we're negotiating with the contractor in
 
04:37:19.150 --> 04:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
the low bid right now so we believe
 
04:37:21.629 --> 04:37:21.639 align:start position:0%
those critical doors will be fixed with
 
04:37:24.390 --> 04:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
the remaining money thank you thank you
 
04:37:27.470 --> 04:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative makoni um commissioner in
 
04:37:30.269 --> 04:37:30.279 align:start position:0%
the past when we've had discussions with
 
04:37:33.590 --> 04:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
the Department about how work is being
 
04:37:36.189 --> 04:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
done within the
 
04:37:38.629 --> 04:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
facilities there's been
 
04:37:42.150 --> 04:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
some let's say discussion of about well
 
04:37:44.109 --> 04:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it inhouse because
 
04:37:47.349 --> 04:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
it's too hard to bring contractors in to
 
04:37:50.670 --> 04:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
do the work how do you anticipate doing
 
04:37:54.390 --> 04:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of these things that are both
 
04:37:57.869 --> 04:37:57.879 align:start position:0%
either given to us by the governor or
 
04:37:59.310 --> 04:37:59.320 align:start position:0%
what you're recommending you going to
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
try to continue to do the work in house
 
04:38:04.830 --> 04:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
or you going to go out to actual bids
 
04:38:07.070 --> 04:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
and get contractors
 
04:38:09.750 --> 04:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
in thank you for that question and we
 
04:38:12.109 --> 04:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
really want to Leverage The going and
 
04:38:14.709 --> 04:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
getting a contractor in we do work with
 
04:38:16.150 --> 04:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
that contractor when there's an
 
04:38:19.590 --> 04:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use our staff um to help
 
04:38:21.109 --> 04:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
either reduce the burden to the state
 
04:38:23.109 --> 04:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we take that opportunity but
 
04:38:25.390 --> 04:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
we certainly recognize that we need to
 
04:38:28.189 --> 04:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
have our staff focusing on uh the
 
04:38:30.789 --> 04:38:30.799 align:start position:0%
continued uh needs at TH those old
 
04:38:32.750 --> 04:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
facilities so it's a primary use of
 
04:38:34.349 --> 04:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
contractors coming in while leveraging
 
04:38:36.390 --> 04:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
our staff to maintain daily operation
 
04:38:36.400 --> 04:38:38.109 align:start position:0%
our staff to maintain daily operation
maintenance

04:38:38.109 --> 04:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
04:38:43.310 --> 04:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
needs thank you thank you um other
 
04:38:43.320 --> 04:38:45.150 align:start position:0%
needs thank you thank you um other
questions

04:38:45.150 --> 04:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:38:47.590 --> 04:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
Thomas uh
 
04:38:47.600 --> 04:38:49.230 align:start position:0%
Thomas uh
commissioner

04:38:49.230 --> 04:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:38:52.230 --> 04:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the septic system for
 
04:38:55.830 --> 04:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
the trades building um is there not
 
04:38:58.029 --> 04:38:58.039 align:start position:0%
sewer running by that part of North Main
 
04:39:00.949 --> 04:39:00.959 align:start position:0%
Street by that yes there is uh
 
04:39:04.390 --> 04:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative um so uh just jumped
 
04:39:06.390 --> 04:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
right in I'm sorry no please because you
 
04:39:07.789 --> 04:39:07.799 align:start position:0%
and I have talked about this go ahead
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
John so it's a great question I asked
 
04:39:12.590 --> 04:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
the same one representative Thompson
 
04:39:14.990 --> 04:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
when we uh when we were able to come up
 
04:39:16.750 --> 04:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
with this latest estimate I personally
 
04:39:19.109 --> 04:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
met with the city again the uphill
 
04:39:21.750 --> 04:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
gradient would require pumping up to
 
04:39:26.510 --> 04:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
their line so until we know for sure we
 
04:39:29.070 --> 04:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
could potentially pump to their line but
 
04:39:31.150 --> 04:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
their suggestion to us was to put a
 
04:39:33.990 --> 04:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
leech field antiseptic system adequate
 
04:39:35.390 --> 04:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh system on our
 
04:39:38.510 --> 04:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
profit it's surprising oh go ahead I'm
 
04:39:38.520 --> 04:39:39.470 align:start position:0%
profit it's surprising oh go ahead I'm
sorry

04:39:39.470 --> 04:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:39:43.390 --> 04:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
sir um the problem is we have a 20-year
 
04:39:46.430 --> 04:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
life on the septic system assuming
 
04:39:47.670 --> 04:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's an
 
04:39:51.868 --> 04:39:51.878 align:start position:0%
accurate um estimate and with the sewer
 
04:39:54.310 --> 04:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
system if you put a grinder pump in your
 
04:39:56.470 --> 04:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
existing holding tank seems like the
 
04:39:59.190 --> 04:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
cost would be substantially lower to
 
04:40:03.070 --> 04:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
pump up to the sewer and then the city's
 
04:40:04.708 --> 04:40:04.718 align:start position:0%
problem once it goes beyond the curb
 
04:40:09.628 --> 04:40:09.638 align:start position:0%
line not hours 20 years down the road or
 
04:40:13.150 --> 04:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of system short
 
04:40:16.910 --> 04:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
just to follow up so on on that uh our
 
04:40:19.390 --> 04:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
preference has been always to go up and
 
04:40:21.628 --> 04:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
tie into their line Public Works and I
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
work together on this and we were
 
04:40:25.590 --> 04:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
surprised the city had suggested we
 
04:40:28.948 --> 04:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
actually put this new type of uh a new
 
04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
septic system in leechfield on site so
 
04:40:34.110 --> 04:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
nothing's been decided yet but the money
 
04:40:36.310 --> 04:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
is there to do either or that amount of
 
04:40:39.788 --> 04:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
money will do either or okay thank you
 
04:40:42.070 --> 04:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
very much apprciate
 
04:40:45.150 --> 04:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
question representative a yes thank you
 
04:40:45.160 --> 04:40:45.948 align:start position:0%
question representative a yes thank you
Mr

04:40:45.948 --> 04:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
04:40:47.990 --> 04:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you commissioner for
 
04:40:51.670 --> 04:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
taking the question I just wonder um
 
04:40:53.470 --> 04:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
because they're very much
 
04:40:56.708 --> 04:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
similar if there's been any discussion
 
04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
with administrative
 
04:41:03.830 --> 04:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
services on these roof repairs and and
 
04:41:03.840 --> 04:41:05.948 align:start position:0%
services on these roof repairs and and
Replacements

04:41:05.948 --> 04:41:05.958 align:start position:0%
Replacements
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:15.350 --> 04:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
um representative are you referring to
 
04:41:17.390 --> 04:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
General services and their their workers
 
04:41:19.708 --> 04:41:19.718 align:start position:0%
that do work on their own or their own
 
04:41:22.788 --> 04:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
projects for roofs their projects for
 
04:41:26.070 --> 04:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
roofs so admin Services Public Works of
 
04:41:28.030 --> 04:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
course being part of that agency is
 
04:41:30.868 --> 04:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
directly involved in these estimates um
 
04:41:32.830 --> 04:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
if you're suggesting possibly combining
 
04:41:34.430 --> 04:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
roofs and getting a better price for
 
04:41:36.070 --> 04:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
more roofs that certainly could be
 
04:41:41.510 --> 04:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:45.030 --> 04:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah that's what my question
 
04:41:49.270 --> 04:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
was because when we spoke to them um
 
04:41:51.430 --> 04:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
they said you know
 
04:41:54.070 --> 04:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
they when they were replaced or fixed
 
04:41:58.350 --> 04:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
the ru that they have to prioritize it
 
04:42:02.230 --> 04:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
and their estimates were based on um you
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
know what the scope of the work would be
 
04:42:09.270 --> 04:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
when they you know
 
04:42:12.830 --> 04:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh discovered what was underneath the
 
04:42:14.310 --> 04:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
roof in
 
04:42:14.320 --> 04:42:17.110 align:start position:0%
roof in
terms

04:42:17.110 --> 04:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
terms
 
04:42:19.628 --> 04:42:19.638 align:start position:0%
the yeah exactly we we've had that
 
04:42:21.470 --> 04:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
encountered on the last big roof
 
04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
projects you folks approved for us we
 
04:42:25.390 --> 04:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
had peins put in the gymnasium and
 
04:42:27.788 --> 04:42:27.798 align:start position:0%
conquered we worked with Das on that and
 
04:42:29.390 --> 04:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
we do combine projects with them like
 
04:42:31.708 --> 04:42:31.718 align:start position:0%
our sprinkler projects typically when we
 
04:42:33.430 --> 04:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
have to add four or five areas of
 
04:42:35.948 --> 04:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
sprinklers we uh for fire suppressions
 
04:42:38.270 --> 04:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
things we we combin with other buildings
 
04:42:39.590 --> 04:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
04:42:41.670 --> 04:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
possible thank you
 
04:42:44.430 --> 04:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that question on
 
04:42:46.948 --> 04:42:46.958 align:start position:0%
the roof Replacements both in the
 
04:42:50.350 --> 04:42:50.360 align:start position:0%
northern correal facility and concrete
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
Are any are either of them currently
 
04:42:57.030 --> 04:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
leaky yes um there are
 
04:42:59.310 --> 04:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
leaks uh especially on the conquered
 
04:43:02.190 --> 04:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
men's facility and we do patch and we
 
04:43:03.868 --> 04:43:03.878 align:start position:0%
have a regular program in the spring we
 
04:43:06.030 --> 04:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
go out and we use some sometimes
 
04:43:08.750 --> 04:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
creative materials um to patch over you
 
04:43:11.788 --> 04:43:11.798 align:start position:0%
know the ebpm type rubber membrane roofs
 
04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
and we know that that does not last
 
04:43:15.150 --> 04:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
forever especially when you use
 
04:43:18.430 --> 04:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
materials that could eat rubber but uh
 
04:43:21.350 --> 04:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
yes we do patch on a regular basis thank
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
you and so that the northern
 
04:43:25.910 --> 04:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facility would
 
04:43:30.110 --> 04:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
be um a higher priority than conquered
 
04:43:34.430 --> 04:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
if a roof replacement was to be
 
04:43:37.350 --> 04:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
funded commission I believe our our
 
04:43:38.948 --> 04:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
discussion has been yes it would be
 
04:43:40.390 --> 04:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
because it's a larger roof and when
 
04:43:42.030 --> 04:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
there is a leak up there there's a lot
 
04:43:43.750 --> 04:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
more square footage where the water can
 
04:43:47.030 --> 04:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
get down into bad parts of that facility
 
04:43:49.628 --> 04:43:49.638 align:start position:0%
um it's a very large flat roof conquered
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
we have pitched roofs in the second
 
04:43:52.430 --> 04:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
phase the one that was not in the
 
04:43:54.628 --> 04:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
governor's budget which need to be
 
04:43:56.628 --> 04:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
addressed and some of those were simply
 
04:44:00.150 --> 04:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:03.430 --> 04:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
drastics thank you and who's got their
 
04:44:07.628 --> 04:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:10.350 --> 04:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
Kinski yes thank you I just had one real
 
04:44:11.948 --> 04:44:11.958 align:start position:0%
quick question
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
um I had a I've actually got a few
 
04:44:16.628 --> 04:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
questions but I'm not going to bother
 
04:44:19.350 --> 04:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
with taking up a lot of time today with
 
04:44:21.550 --> 04:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
but I was wondering if I could get a
 
04:44:23.510 --> 04:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
good email address forwarded to me that
 
04:44:25.788 --> 04:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
I could email some questions about the
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
capital Improvement plan yes
 
04:44:31.550 --> 04:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely all right so if somebody
 
04:44:33.350 --> 04:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
could forward me that email
 
04:44:36.750 --> 04:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
address um that would be appreciated you
 
04:44:38.670 --> 04:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
had another one
 
04:44:41.990 --> 04:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
Ben what's that you had another question
 
04:44:45.948 --> 04:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
you said um no that's my only real
 
04:44:47.788 --> 04:44:47.798 align:start position:0%
question for the group right now because
 
04:44:50.030 --> 04:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
I've got my Capital Improvement plan
 
04:44:52.230 --> 04:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
questions are there's quite a few of
 
04:44:54.750 --> 04:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
them um and I don't want to take up a
 
04:44:58.750 --> 04:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
bunch of time during that okay
 
04:45:02.708 --> 04:45:02.718 align:start position:0%
representative Evo yes thank you um so
 
04:45:05.830 --> 04:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
how are we doing as far as capacity in
 
04:45:08.708 --> 04:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
the men's and women's prisons I'm
 
04:45:10.390 --> 04:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
particularly in interested in the
 
04:45:13.470 --> 04:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
women's just built
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
it our 224 bed facility for women we are
 
04:45:21.230 --> 04:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
currently today at
 
04:45:23.830 --> 04:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
136 and so we're certainly living in
 
04:45:25.948 --> 04:45:25.958 align:start position:0%
that facility in a appropriate and
 
04:45:28.910 --> 04:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable way which is nice that we
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
did not build it too big or too small at
 
04:45:36.190 --> 04:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
the Men's prison uh today we have housed
 
04:45:39.910 --> 04:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
1,244 individuals um that is definitely
 
04:45:41.948 --> 04:45:41.958 align:start position:0%
down I will let you know I've seen our
 
04:45:44.070 --> 04:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
population slowly decreasing at these
 
04:45:45.990 --> 04:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
institutions over the last five years
 
04:45:49.590 --> 04:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's a good sign uh but there're still
 
04:45:51.070 --> 04:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
they've still all been with the
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
exception of women's been modified from
 
04:45:55.750 --> 04:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
the original design capacity so we
 
04:45:57.628 --> 04:45:57.638 align:start position:0%
haven't quite gotten uh to the place
 
04:45:59.590 --> 04:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
where we can take out those I would call
 
04:46:01.590 --> 04:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
them extra beds that were never intended
 
04:46:03.230 --> 04:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
to be there representative able and I
 
04:46:05.550 --> 04:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
can certainly follow up with some recent
 
04:46:07.788 --> 04:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
information I gathered for division one
 
04:46:09.350 --> 04:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
house finance and I'd be happy to share
 
04:46:11.350 --> 04:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
it with the whole committee to show you
 
04:46:13.590 --> 04:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
where we believe it was designed where
 
04:46:16.230 --> 04:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
we are functionally today and it'll show
 
04:46:18.230 --> 04:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
you uh the differences in design
 
04:46:20.070 --> 04:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
capacity in fact um chairman I'll send
 
04:46:21.030 --> 04:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
that to the whole committee I think
 
04:46:22.350 --> 04:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
it'll be helpful for you to have that
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
information yeah I'd appreciate it thank
 
04:46:27.708 --> 04:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you for that
 
04:46:31.110 --> 04:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
question any other questions from
 
04:46:33.470 --> 04:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee representative
 
04:46:37.230 --> 04:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
mononi thank you Mr chairman um I know
 
04:46:40.070 --> 04:46:40.080 align:start position:0%

Project number 11 that was explored
 
04:46:46.628 --> 04:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:48.990 --> 04:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
one yeah
 
04:46:51.948 --> 04:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
one and uh if I could follow up on that
 
04:46:54.310 --> 04:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
do we we own that building and do we own
 
04:46:56.990 --> 04:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
the property that it sits on yes we do
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%

working with h public works on that
 
04:47:06.390 --> 04:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
project so if we had other questions
 
04:47:08.708 --> 04:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
we'd ask them yes sir we are working
 
04:47:10.590 --> 04:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
with public works on that project thank
 
04:47:13.990 --> 04:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
you so much thank
 
04:47:16.788 --> 04:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
you I would offer to the committee if it
 
04:47:18.310 --> 04:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
be appropriate right now to let you know
 
04:47:21.310 --> 04:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
that it looks like of um past projects
 
04:47:22.830 --> 04:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
it looks like we have a lapse amount
 
04:47:25.990 --> 04:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
that will occur of aund just well just
 
04:47:26.000 --> 04:47:27.110 align:start position:0%
that will occur of aund just well just
under

04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:47:29.708 --> 04:47:29.718 align:start position:0%
$153,000 uh dollars if there was an
 
04:47:29.718 --> 04:47:31.670 align:start position:0%
$153,000 uh dollars if there was an
opportunity

04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:43.510 --> 04:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
$52,800 55 cents um there may be an
 
04:47:45.430 --> 04:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity if at the will of this
 
04:47:47.708 --> 04:47:47.718 align:start position:0%
committee that that money be deployed to
 
04:47:49.070 --> 04:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
um some of these other projects that
 
04:47:50.470 --> 04:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
didn't make the list but certainly I
 
04:47:52.310 --> 04:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
know you have a lot of State
 
04:47:56.470 --> 04:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
priorities and we thank you for that and
 
04:48:00.628 --> 04:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
as you know in the past we have
 
04:48:03.628 --> 04:48:03.638 align:start position:0%
harvested um money from projects from
 
04:48:07.310 --> 04:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
all agencies to use on on projects
 
04:48:11.030 --> 04:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so anything five
 
04:48:13.708 --> 04:48:13.718 align:start position:0%
will be used for the betterment of the
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
state not necessarily your agency no
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
offense no offense taken sir but I
 
04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
thought you would want to know that
 
04:48:24.910 --> 04:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity existed and represent
 
04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
smiling under here representative Jack
 
04:48:30.190 --> 04:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
will be chairing a uh a subcommittee
 
04:48:33.628 --> 04:48:33.638 align:start position:0%
looking at all of the uh lapses and
 
04:48:36.430 --> 04:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
extensions of lapses so that we know
 
04:48:38.910 --> 04:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
where we are on all of that before we
 
04:48:42.430 --> 04:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
make any final decisions
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information yeah I
 
04:48:45.788 --> 04:48:45.798 align:start position:0%
just want you to know commissioner even
 
04:48:47.310 --> 04:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
though it might not be one of the
 
04:48:49.910 --> 04:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
governor's High priorities on his budget
 
04:48:52.708 --> 04:48:52.718 align:start position:0%
lists ever since we've uh our Public
 
04:48:54.510 --> 04:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
Works committee came by and toured your
 
04:48:56.910 --> 04:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
prison we've been very very big on your
 
04:48:59.628 --> 04:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
door containers and very big that's one
 
04:49:02.548 --> 04:49:02.558 align:start position:0%
of our priorities thank you I appreciate
 
04:49:06.190 --> 04:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:10.190 --> 04:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
that and again happy to take people on
 
04:49:12.948 --> 04:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
tours when it's safe and uh probably two
 
04:49:14.548 --> 04:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
at a time would probably be the best
 
04:49:15.990 --> 04:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
approach if there's anyone that has not
 
04:49:17.788 --> 04:49:17.798 align:start position:0%
been in to see that um interesting
 
04:49:20.190 --> 04:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure architectural history as
 
04:49:22.230 --> 04:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
I like to call
 
04:49:26.948 --> 04:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
it representative evil yes thank you um
 
04:49:29.590 --> 04:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
so I can't remember anymore if it was
 
04:49:31.430 --> 04:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
last term we had an awful lot of
 
04:49:34.110 --> 04:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
discussion about the special psychiatric
 
04:49:38.270 --> 04:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
unit and what's happening with that I
 
04:49:40.750 --> 04:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
know because of uh Financial con
 
04:49:43.310 --> 04:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
straints we're probably not talking
 
04:49:44.750 --> 04:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
about it right now but if you had
 
04:49:46.430 --> 04:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
anything you wanted to share on that
 
04:49:48.628 --> 04:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
subject I'd like to hear
 
04:49:51.150 --> 04:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
it uh certainly representative AEL I
 
04:49:52.750 --> 04:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
don't have any capital budget projects
 
04:49:54.910 --> 04:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
Associated but I I do understand that
 
04:49:56.948 --> 04:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
there's a bill that allocates uh there's
 
04:49:58.470 --> 04:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
a bill proposed that allocates $8
 
04:50:01.628 --> 04:50:01.638 align:start position:0%
million to build a structure on property
 
04:50:03.470 --> 04:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
owned by the state near New Hampshire
 
04:50:05.548 --> 04:50:05.558 align:start position:0%
hospital and I'll send you that bill
 
04:50:07.750 --> 04:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
number um and if it if it's the will
 
04:50:09.070 --> 04:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
committee I send it to all of you to
 
04:50:12.628 --> 04:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
keep you informed of that much long
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
conversation is that a Senate
 
04:50:18.270 --> 04:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
bill um or maybe you know about it Mr
 
04:50:20.470 --> 04:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
chair and I don't I'm I've heard
 
04:50:22.470 --> 04:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
something about what something was in
 
04:50:25.590 --> 04:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
hille 2 that may be coming out I don't
 
04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
know if Mr Shay can answer that question
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
at this point otherwise we'll have to do
 
04:50:31.910 --> 04:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
some research but commissioner if you
 
04:50:34.390 --> 04:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
could send it it would be appreciated be
 
04:50:36.150 --> 04:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
happy to I I'll track that down for the
 
04:50:38.270 --> 04:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
committee and send it out because I'm as
 
04:50:40.830 --> 04:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
interested As You Are
 
04:50:42.390 --> 04:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
separate the Civil committed from the
 
04:50:45.788 --> 04:50:45.798 align:start position:0%
adjudicated would be nice yes you
 
04:50:48.270 --> 04:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
clearly you know my stance on that
 
04:50:52.990 --> 04:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
now thank you very much you're very
 
04:50:56.628 --> 04:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
welcome any other questions for the
 
04:50:58.750 --> 04:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections about their
 
04:50:58.760 --> 04:51:01.270 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections about their
capital

04:51:01.270 --> 04:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
capital
 
04:51:05.708 --> 04:51:05.718 align:start position:0%
projects seeing none um if we have more
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
questions commissioner I'm sure we will
 
04:51:09.510 --> 04:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
be in touch with you or members of your
 
04:51:13.510 --> 04:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
staff um especially if we go forward and
 
04:51:15.830 --> 04:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
we do find some additional funds to
 
04:51:18.230 --> 04:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
begin to look at some of your unfunded
 
04:51:21.310 --> 04:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
projects we would probably ask you some
 
04:51:21.320 --> 04:51:22.990 align:start position:0%
projects we would probably ask you some
more

04:51:22.990 --> 04:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:51:25.310 --> 04:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
questions well thank you sir thank you
 
04:51:26.548 --> 04:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
members of the committee it is a
 
04:51:29.190 --> 04:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
pleasure to see you I look forward to to
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
being in person some of these days going
 
04:51:32.510 --> 04:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
forward I wish you all well and I thank
 
04:51:34.390 --> 04:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
you for your service to the state of New
 
04:51:42.390 --> 04:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:45.350 --> 04:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
any member of the committee have
 
04:51:47.470 --> 04:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
anything they need to share with the
 
04:51:50.350 --> 04:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
rest of us or questions they would like
 
04:51:52.990 --> 04:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
to ask me because I probably don't know
 
04:51:54.868 --> 04:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
the answer but you can
 
04:51:57.708 --> 04:51:57.718 align:start position:0%
ask again Mr chairman earlier today
 
04:52:00.310 --> 04:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
under Department of CTE we I think we
 
04:52:02.030 --> 04:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
should fall especially the situation I
 
04:52:03.830 --> 04:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
would White Field just in case they do
 
04:52:07.470 --> 04:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
pass it I agree uh hopefully everybody
 
04:52:09.390 --> 04:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
heard what representative cluder said he
 
04:52:11.868 --> 04:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
said we need to stay on top of and
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
follow what uh Whitefield is doing or
 
04:52:18.470 --> 04:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
not doing about their CTE before we
 
04:52:22.548 --> 04:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
finalize uh the house version of
 
04:52:25.150 --> 04:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
hb25 um and not leave it to the Senate
 
04:52:28.150 --> 04:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
to try to fix I mean I would think March
 
04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
is coming up so they're going to vote on
 
04:52:32.030 --> 04:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
sometime in March school district and I
 
04:52:33.470 --> 04:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
just don't know when March 9th I know
 
04:52:36.628 --> 04:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
was town meeting day some schools but
 
04:52:39.350 --> 04:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
but I think we should try to I mean I
 
04:52:41.510 --> 04:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to add my position Advocate
 
04:52:43.390 --> 04:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
get it done frankly I have a vested
 
04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
interest because next basically is
 
04:52:47.548 --> 04:52:47.558 align:start position:0%
Claremont Newport which is not as of now
 
04:52:50.310 --> 04:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
not until next by enum right you
 
04:52:52.030 --> 04:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to be competing with that
 
04:52:53.548 --> 04:52:53.558 align:start position:0%
I I'd rather to get Whitefield out of
 
04:52:55.110 --> 04:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
the way because I don't want Whitefield
 
04:52:56.990 --> 04:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
if we can do it after the voters go
 
04:53:00.070 --> 04:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
along of course representative
 
04:53:03.030 --> 04:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
bunker thank you Mr chair um I took note
 
04:53:05.150 --> 04:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
of what commissioner Hanks just said
 
04:53:07.868 --> 04:53:07.878 align:start position:0%
about um tours of the facility um and as
 
04:53:10.548 --> 04:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
a new uh member of this committee I
 
04:53:11.910 --> 04:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
interested in that and I just wanted to
 
04:53:14.070 --> 04:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
mention out loud so that if any other
 
04:53:15.350 --> 04:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
new member of the committee would like
 
04:53:17.708 --> 04:53:17.718 align:start position:0%
to join me um get in touch and maybe we
 
04:53:20.548 --> 04:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
can set something up and and it is
 
04:53:23.470 --> 04:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
worthwhile um you get a sense of
 
04:53:25.350 --> 04:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
forboding as you go
 
04:53:30.270 --> 04:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
in it is um a very old well um at the
 
04:53:33.510 --> 04:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
time wellb built facility um the the
 
04:53:35.470 --> 04:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
nicer one is to go to the North country
 
04:53:37.990 --> 04:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
and go through that one but it's a
 
04:53:40.788 --> 04:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
little further away
 
04:53:42.390 --> 04:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
okay so any any member of the committee
 
04:53:44.030 --> 04:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
who wants to do it too please just get
 
04:53:48.708 --> 04:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:54.030 --> 04:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:56.590 --> 04:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
hands all his questions regarding
 
04:53:59.350 --> 04:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
capital budget just for the pris or was
 
04:54:03.350 --> 04:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
it um hey Ben if you're there your
 
04:54:06.190 --> 04:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
questions deal with the overall program
 
04:54:08.230 --> 04:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
or just with the
 
04:54:11.548 --> 04:54:11.558 align:start position:0%
prison uh my question were really with
 
04:54:16.230 --> 04:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
the prisons and and I mean I'm curious
 
04:54:18.470 --> 04:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
and I know it's not uncommon to see a
 
04:54:22.070 --> 04:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
lot of 20 30 year old projects come up
 
04:54:23.788 --> 04:54:23.798 align:start position:0%
all at once at the same time to have to
 
04:54:26.548 --> 04:54:26.558 align:start position:0%
be worked on um but I was just curious
 
04:54:31.390 --> 04:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
to see what they have in place for a
 
04:54:35.230 --> 04:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
long-term capital Improvement plan and
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
how often that that's being updated and
 
04:54:39.830 --> 04:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
monitored and how old some of their
 
04:54:39.840 --> 04:54:42.230 align:start position:0%
monitored and how old some of their
other

04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:54:46.990 --> 04:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
with I the commissioner left her
 
04:54:47.000 --> 04:54:49.430 align:start position:0%
