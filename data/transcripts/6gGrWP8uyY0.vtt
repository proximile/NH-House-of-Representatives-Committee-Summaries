00:31:39.409 --> 00:31:39.419 align:start position:0%
so what I'd like to do first is look at
 
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
Force 452
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
this is a bill which we're dealing with
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
and we have to get out of committee this
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
next week and it deals with the entire
 
00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
building Aid Grant application process
 
00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
and there are several components within
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
I just like to walk through really
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
quickly with you that we are looking at
 
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:03.299 align:start position:0%
significant things which give the
 
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
rationale for why we are doing this bill
 
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.970 align:start position:0%
rationale for why we are doing this bill
today

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
I think everybody understands that
 
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
probably the most important thing we
 
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
have to do is the timeline for Grants is
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
the current process is a timeline that
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
just so pinched and by the way for
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
everybody here representative Hill is
 
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
Chairman of the school building
 
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
authority which has a a component or
 
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
responsibility tied directly with
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
of this building application process
 
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
that we have established right now
 
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to walk through that and and
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
uh highlight some of the primary things
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
which we have you you also have a sheet
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
did you all get this sheet right here
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
this is sheet that has comments on the
 
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.409 align:start position:0%
this is sheet that has comments on the
side

00:32:51.409 --> 00:32:51.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
that's the bill but we also have an
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill but I want to look
 
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
at this one right here it has some of
 
00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
the amend mending language within but
 
00:32:59.690 --> 00:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
just hitting on some of the key
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
components that we may want to be
 
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
discussing on the first page that one
 
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
has HP 452 as introduced and the word
 
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:10.140 align:start position:0%
introduced has been scratched out and
 
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
amended 3 2 23. on the bottom of that
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
page on lines 28 going on down there's
 
00:33:18.649 --> 00:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
an area which
 
00:33:18.659 --> 00:33:19.269 align:start position:0%
an area which
um

00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
has been a
 
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
possible issue of contention that we pay
 
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
when a School receives this money they
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
get 80 percent up front
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
and 20 20 upon completion of the project
 
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
and that is that decisions made by Amy
 
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
when they complete that project then
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
then uh that's uh when they will receive
 
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
that other 20 there are those out there
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
saying that perhaps we ought not be
 
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
funding 80 up front maybe we should be
 
00:33:54.289 --> 00:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
sprinkling that over the period lifetime
 
00:33:57.409 --> 00:33:57.419 align:start position:0%
of the bond enabling more school
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
districts to receive building Aid on the
 
00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:03.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.049 align:start position:0%
 
 businessman

00:34:06.049 --> 00:34:06.059 align:start position:0%
 businessman
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
yeah and it's been proposed to by a
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
number of folks when we've had the
 
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
hearings here that's coming from a lot
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
of directions the reason why this 80 up
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
front was put there
 
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:20.220 align:start position:0%
there are several reasons one of which
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
it results in the local school district
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
not having to pay the interest on that
 
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
bond for that period of time they're
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
going to get 80 up front is that correct
 
00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:35.570 align:start position:0%
going to get 80 up front is that correct
Amy

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.710 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
probably because it was in the calendar
 
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:41.339 align:start position:0%
so then I will push the button that's
 
00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:43.220 align:start position:0%
correct representative
 
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so I wanted to highlight
 
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
that one right there and there is a
 
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
comment there which uh reference it
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh as you go down through on page two
 
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
you can see that there's some comments
 
00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
and same eligibility criteria conditions
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
for the the charter school as Lea we we
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
have inline online three at the top
 
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
there on page two the amount of the
 
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
grant to any Charter Public School
 
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
established in accordance with the rsab
 
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah shall be 30 percent of
 
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
the eligible cost of construction
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
there's been some issues associated with
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
this uh Amy in terms we have it here but
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have it elsewhere in statute is
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
that correct that's correct charter
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
schools are essentially prohibited in a
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
correct why not correct
 
00:35:38.099 --> 00:35:41.349 align:start position:0%
correct why not correct
yeah

00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
this this is good right so this goes
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
through this committee next week
 
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're doing this now so
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
building it allows Charter Schools it
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
has a um it has a rate let me just say
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
building it has a 30 flat rate for
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools however somewhere else
 
00:35:59.569 --> 00:35:59.579 align:start position:0%
in the law in the charter school law
 
00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:02.579 align:start position:0%
says that um they can't apply to for
 
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
building Aid which doesn't that's not
 
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
verbatim but essentially prohibits them
 
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
from seeking building Aid
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
okay on line five on that same page
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
funds received from charitable trust
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
bequests gifts insurance policies
 
00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
federal grants
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
or grants from other state programs
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
shall be subtracted from the total
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
project costs when Computing grants
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
under this paragraph that's been in law
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
a long time but that's also a
 
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
we wanted to speak to that from my own
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
personal experience I would like to do
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
that at your you know at your discretion
 
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
before you leave the topic well we're
 
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
going to be leaving that topic real
 
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
shortly here so so watching her while
 
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
you drove down from Coburg or Pittsburgh
 
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.910 align:start position:0%
you drove down from Coburg or Pittsburgh
so

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
let's give you the opportunity you are
 
00:37:01.329 --> 00:37:01.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not busy tomorrow
 
00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:07.460 align:start position:0%
yeah oh I know I've uh
 
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:09.960 align:start position:0%

00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools for sau7 which

Pittsburgh and Stewartstown school
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
districts and I've searched for 15 years
 
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
as a superintendent three in my current
 
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.750 align:start position:0%
as a superintendent three in my current
position

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
so I'm here today to implore you to make
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
very necessary changes to proposed HB
 
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
452 changes that with a stroke of your
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
pen will change the lives of the
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
students in the Colebrook school
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
district and our surrounding communities
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
let me briefly tell our story
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
last fall the Colebrook School District
 
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
was notified we were ranked number two
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
for eligibility for building Aid
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
we presented uh a 16.5 million dollar
 
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
project and were approved for 60 percent
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
of the State Building Aid up to 9.9
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.790 align:start position:0%
million dollars
estimated

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
and dependent upon legislative
 
00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.109 align:start position:0%
and dependent upon legislative
Appropriations

00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
our school board and District building
 
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
Committee in conjunction with their
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
architectural firm created a modest
 
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
design including High School classrooms
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
and Labs which integrated our newly
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
approved North Point CTE Center on the
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
same campus as a elementary school
 
00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:32.339 align:start position:0%
our committee and parent support group
 
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
initiated a Community Information
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
campaign colebrook's a small town and
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
our net assessment assess valuation is
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
just over 193 million
 
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
the school includes one Pre-K 12 school
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
with 320 students housed in an
 
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
elementary school as well as tuition
 
00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:53.099 align:start position:0%
students from six towns in the
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
surrounding area
 
00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
our high school students transitioned to
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
the elementary school when the academy
 
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
closed in 2019 because it was unsafe and
 
00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
provided many difficulties for that were
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
much too costly to repair the original
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
um we also had a tech building behind
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
that building which we're currently
 
00:39:20.569 --> 00:39:20.579 align:start position:0%
leasing because the old school has been
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
sold and that leases up in three years
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
so our project includes building an
 
00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
addition as I mentioned of 28 300 square
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
feet and a renovation of 7 700 square
 
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
feet including conversion of existing
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
well at this point we were looking at
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
existing administrative spaces but we've
 
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
recently changed subsequently excuse me
 
00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:44.579 align:start position:0%
had changed that to include a separate
 
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
building which about for the same cost
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
which would be more efficient including
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
a health science lab computer technology
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
Center automotive technology bays and a
 
00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
new high school gym
 
00:39:58.970 --> 00:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
the site development costs were also
 
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
included including utility work parking
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
area and Landscaping as well as
 
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
contingency funds
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
so now I'm going to quote do a quote for
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
you I hope you don't mind I enjoy poetry
 
00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
and literature and this one really
 
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
seemed to fit for me today so I'm sure
 
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
you're all familiar with this is very
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
famous from Charles Dickens The Tale of
 
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
Two Cities and expresses our
 
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
circumstances well
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
so with that background it was the best
 
00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
of times it was the worst of times it
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
was the age of wisdom it was the age of
 
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.109 align:start position:0%
was the age of wisdom it was the age of
foolishness

00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
foolishness
 
00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:32.579 align:start position:0%
it was the Epic of belief it was the
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
Epic of incredulity it was the season of
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
light it was the season of Darkness it
 
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
was the spring of Hope
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
it was the winter of Despair we had
 
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
everything before us and we had nothing
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
before us
 
00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:47.579 align:start position:0%
and now I'll explain why we are in that
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
you know just hold on our gently but
 
00:40:58.849 --> 00:40:58.859 align:start position:0%
yeah okay yeah it would be the other
 
00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:02.300 align:start position:0%
door too to the office
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
no that's all right so at this time with
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
inflation higher than in nearly a
 
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
generation we had to ask our community
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
to fund 40 of our project
 
00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
this particular line five on page two of
 
00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
your bill that you've been reviewing
 
00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.390 align:start position:0%
your bill that you've been reviewing
today

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
specifies that donations and grants
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
cannot be used
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
separate apart from the total cost of
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
the project to reduce the local taxpayer
 
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.650 align:start position:0%
the project to reduce the local taxpayer
contribution

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
earlier this week on Tuesday we had 700
 
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
people from our community we have a
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
thousand voters 700 came to our annual
 
00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:41.339 align:start position:0%
school meeting we had divided them into
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
two large spaces that were available to
 
00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:45.500 align:start position:0%
us our gym in our cafeteria
 
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our vote was not
 
00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.010 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our vote was not
successful

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:41:53.089 --> 00:41:53.099 align:start position:0%
for this project however our budget and
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
our teacher Collective boarding
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
agreement did pass
 
00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
the difficulty is
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
that 40 percent of our project is 6.5
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars and with a 15 year bond
 
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
at 5.25 we are speaking of on average
 
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
four dollars
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
per thousand
 
00:42:14.089 --> 00:42:14.099 align:start position:0%
for our depressed community in Colebrook
 
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
and I mean that only in the way it's
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
described elsewhere I would never use
 
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
that term to describe our community
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
anywhere else but in a place where it
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
relates to our the economics of our
 
00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.089 align:start position:0%
relates to our the economics of our
situation

00:42:26.089 --> 00:42:26.099 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:42:26.099 --> 00:42:27.290 align:start position:0%
situation
so

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:29.569 --> 00:42:29.579 align:start position:0%
um despite these challenges
 
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
um we have had more and more people come
 
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
forward and offer assistance so in
 
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
addition to the 60 million I'm sorry 60
 
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
um allocation from the Department
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
on February 7th we were offered a two
 
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
million dollar donation
 
00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:46.700 align:start position:0%
from a graduate of co-work Academy
 
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
who has he's been identified in our
 
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
newspaper I'd rather not put them into
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
the record but he agreed to provide us
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
with a two million dollar donation if it
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
could be separate and apart from
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
the way that you're currently your
 
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
legislation reads which is
 
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
essentially it would have to be utilized
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
to reduce the overall project than
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
building a supply that's how the law
 
00:43:10.569 --> 00:43:10.579 align:start position:0%
reads right now
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
because he would like would want it to
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
have the full 2 million
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
applicable to reducing taxpayers costs
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
not just a portion of it
 
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
following that we receive notification
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
that a local contractor was willing to
 
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
build this project for us at a savings
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
of 1.5 million dollars
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
then a few weeks later we were told that
 
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
the original donor was coming back and
 
00:43:38.809 --> 00:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
offering another eight hundred thousand
 
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
dollars now we were down to about
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
3.1 million of you know again outside of
 
00:43:47.089 --> 00:43:47.099 align:start position:0%
your formula 3.1 million of funds that
 
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
had not been collected still at all our
 
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
community did not feel that they could
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
take that on
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
unlike our CTE building projects where
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
75 Aid is provided and 25 match can come
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
from any source
 
00:44:08.109 --> 00:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
198 15E which is also in your bill now
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
prohibits Aid recipients from
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
contributing to the local match
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
the language that's also contained in
 
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
the proposed in your proposed bill which
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
states that funds received from
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts bequests gifts
 
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
insurance policies federal grants or
 
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
grants from other state programs shall
 
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
be subtracted from the total project
 
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:29.220 align:start position:0%
costs when Computing grants under this
 
00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.250 align:start position:0%
costs when Computing grants under this
paragraph

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
our community is proud hard-working and
 
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
devoted to our children however they
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
have reached their economic limit their
 
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
total tax burden including the town the
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
school and the county is over thirty
 
00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339 align:start position:0%
dollars per thousand this year
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
it's really too much for them to take on
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
more taxable burden
 
00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
however Coburg School District located
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
and so as we are in a isolated part of
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
the state we really are the center of
 
00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:06.500 align:start position:0%
education for New Hampshire schools
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
and we have a 500 square mile School
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
District not to mention the many towns
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
that are surrounding us that are outside
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
of our district that also pay tuition to
 
00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
send children to Colebrook schools
 
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
without this appropriation
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
in three years our tech building which
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're now leasing to Hauser Automotive
 
00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
program will have to will have to be
 
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
closed that means we will have no place
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
for our auto program and our woodworking
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
program to be available
 
00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
we have used a borrowed space from a
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
neighboring town in another school
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
district in a family consumer science
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
building to offer our culinary
 
00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
Hospitality CTE program because we don't
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
have space in our building
 
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
I'm confident that if that particular
 
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
portion of the law could be changed or
 
00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.410 align:start position:0%
portion of the law could be changed or
removed

00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
removed
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
that funds receive from the travel cross
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
bequests gifts insurance policies grants
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
or grants from other state programs
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
can be struck so that we can
 
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
align them to our can remove them from
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
that computation and reduce our local
 
00:46:15.119 --> 00:46:16.210 align:start position:0%
that computation and reduce our local
tax

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:16.220 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
obligation that we would be able to
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
receive sufficient money from donations
 
00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
and grants to pay the entire remaining
 
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
of the amount of three million dollars
 
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
because of the way the law is written
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
right now we can't
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
do we have another chance of passing
 
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
this next year yes
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
I'm not certain that the our economy is
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
going to improve to the extent that
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to
 
00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:43.740 align:start position:0%
that our taxpayers are going to be able
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
to find funds available in their own
 
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
personal finances to support it while
 
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
they do support the schools as I
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned in many ways
 
00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
so my suggestions to you are this and
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
then I'll be quiet thank you for
 
00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
listening to me for so long and this
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
even though we're not formally in a
 
00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:59.750 align:start position:0%
even though we're not formally in a
hearing

00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:47:01.849 --> 00:47:01.859 align:start position:0%
first that you just strike that entire
 
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
section of the bill
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
which relates to the fund's charitable
 
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
trusts and great gifts and grants
 
00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
or if that's a bridge too far in your
 
00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
opinion consider adding a provision that
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
waives the requirement for school
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
districts eligible for 60 percent
 
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
building Aid which are those districts
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
like ours that are low income that have
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
a high percentage of Freedom reduced
 
00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:26.420 align:start position:0%
lunch where our taxpayers are already
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
extremely burdened due to property taxes
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
as the primary way that we fund our
 
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.010 align:start position:0%
as the primary way that we fund our
schools

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:33.020 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
lastly and this is probably the least
 
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
likely but um the another option you
 
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
might have and I've seen this in other
 
00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
legislation if you don't support the
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
other two options I request that a
 
00:47:45.119 --> 00:47:46.190 align:start position:0%
other two options I request that a
specific

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
statement be included that would exempt
 
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
Colebrook School District from this
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
particular provision so that we can get
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
on with building our school and making a
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
better future for the students in
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
Colebrook siu-7 and all the surrounding
 
00:48:02.809 --> 00:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
communities in the North country
 
00:48:05.329 --> 00:48:05.339 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
I included in my in your material you
 
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
had that testimony along with these
 
00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:11.099 align:start position:0%
green handouts we have copies those up
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
here describe the CTE Center so that you
 
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
can see all of what's included and how
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
very exciting it is
 
00:48:18.359 --> 00:48:19.010 align:start position:0%
very exciting it is
um

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
we are we're devastated with a loss of
 
00:48:23.569 --> 00:48:23.579 align:start position:0%
our vote
 
00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm just not convinced that our
 
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
community can afford the remaining funds
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
the six million dollars that are
 
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
required in order to
 
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
make this project happen and um
 
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
it's not the I always look at it this
 
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:40.430 align:start position:0%
it's not the I always look at it this
way

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
I'm coming in and I'm going to choke up
 
00:48:42.599 --> 00:48:45.410 align:start position:0%
I'm coming in and I'm going to choke up
sorry

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
this is my 40th year of Education
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
like I'm sure many of you
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
um I came from a humble beginning and
 
00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:00.589 align:start position:0%
um I came from a humble beginning and
um

00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
it's not our kid's fault
 
00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
that they were born in a community that
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
is poor
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
it's up to us to help them
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:49:14.589 --> 00:49:14.599 align:start position:0%
develop into people that are going to be
 
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
positive and contributing members of
 
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
society and have the skills that they
 
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
need to ensure that they will have a
 
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
positive life and can contribute to
 
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
their community
 
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
not sure if it's appropriate
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.599 --> 00:49:52.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:56.089 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:49:56.089 --> 00:49:56.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
so part of my responsibility is that in
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
the in the school building authority I
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
was put in place because of my finance
 
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.150 align:start position:0%
was put in place because of my finance
background

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
um which I'm unable to use actually
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
um in my in my current position on the
 
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
school building authority
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
um we actually have two Finance people
 
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
we have the um on the board
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
we have the state treasurer and we have
 
00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.349 align:start position:0%
we have the state treasurer and we have
myself

00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:50:24.359 --> 00:50:25.250 align:start position:0%
myself
um

00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
but neither of us and we struggle with
 
00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:28.790 align:start position:0%
but neither of us and we struggle with
this

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
um speaking for myself anyway with what
 
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
what I deem to be my fiduciary
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility my goal as a as a finance
 
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
person is to always look for the clients
 
00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
needs first not
 
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
for my needs
 
00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
as such when I'm on the school billing
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
Authority I try to look for these states
 
00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.490 align:start position:0%
Authority I try to look for these states
interest

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:51.500 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
we're spending State taxpayers money is
 
00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:58.140 align:start position:0%
the way I look at it and and I'm not
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
able to with the current setup with the
 
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
way our our scoring system and
 
00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:08.420 align:start position:0%
everything it doesn't lend itself well
 
00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:12.059 align:start position:0%
to individual stories it works great for
 
00:51:12.059 --> 00:51:13.309 align:start position:0%
to individual stories it works great for
the

00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
for the process as a whole
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
but individual parts of it
 
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
I think are failing
 
00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:22.670 align:start position:0%
I think are failing
so

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
so I'm receptive to ideas that you have
 
00:51:30.049 --> 00:51:30.059 align:start position:0%
in fact I welcome creative ideas
 
00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:33.740 align:start position:0%
like carving out 60 percent
 
00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:37.940 align:start position:0%
towns or or districts I also look at
 
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:41.220 align:start position:0%
carving out just for the sake of
 
00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:42.670 align:start position:0%
carving out just for the sake of
argument

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
argument
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
Colebrook if you look at the points
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
awarded under unsafe conditions for fire
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
safety infrastructural and blah blah
 
00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:52.370 align:start position:0%
safety infrastructural and blah blah
blah

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
blah
 
00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:54.410 align:start position:0%
blah
um

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:55.849 align:start position:0%
um
that

00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:58.970 --> 00:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
speaks to me as well you know if we look
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
at that alone the the issue you just
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
brought up we also know in correct me if
 
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
I'm incorrect Amy that the there's an
 
00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:11.579 align:start position:0%
emergency process that if a school is in
 
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
a situation where there is such an
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
emergency where you have issues of a
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
roof we're ready to fall in or if you
 
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
have yeah some of that basic building
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
code that we drafted into this
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
legislation years ago where it's
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the Fire Marshals uh
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations that uh that would take
 
00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
precedent over some of the other
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
projects that are in line is that
 
00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.410 align:start position:0%
projects that are in line is that
correct

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:52:42.849 --> 00:52:42.859 align:start position:0%
uh that's correct in the sense that
 
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
somebody that comes
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
um we haven't been in this process long
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
enough to develop a backlog list of
 
00:52:51.599 --> 00:52:52.849 align:start position:0%
enough to develop a backlog list of
projects

00:52:52.849 --> 00:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:52:55.609 --> 00:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
um but if a project was to apply the
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
following year uh they can jump that
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
line otherwise they just get in line
 
00:53:05.809 --> 00:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
four right now then on on this pay paper
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
and look at lines 15 going forward
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
before we get there just let me put on
 
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
the on the the record before we get off
 
00:53:17.089 --> 00:53:17.099 align:start position:0%
the unsafe conditions yeah part of this
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
the it's no to me it's no coincidence
 
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
that the schools that are ranked one two
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
and three
 
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
all score the highest number of points
 
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.450 align:start position:0%
all score the highest number of points
for

00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
unsafe conditions yeah
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
so that's to me
 
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:35.809 align:start position:0%
so that's to me
um

00:53:35.809 --> 00:53:35.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:38.700 align:start position:0%
telling me that it it's some somehow
 
00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
Works to to Value those pieces but there
 
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
is no waiting other than the fact that
 
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
of the number of points that are
 
00:53:50.329 --> 00:53:50.339 align:start position:0%
gathered in this on page four it has a
 
00:53:52.569 --> 00:53:52.579 align:start position:0%
portion there which has been added into
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
452 which deals with the school building
 
00:53:54.839 --> 00:53:56.589 align:start position:0%
452 which deals with the school building
authority

00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
and on the bottom of of course if you
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
look at line 15 16 that's the emergency
 
00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
projects that the commissioner can deal
 
00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:05.990 align:start position:0%
projects that the commissioner can deal
with

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
but if you look down at line 28 29 30
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
going on to the other page and we're
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
talking about the school building
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
authority here what you shall or you
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
shall not do
 
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
School building authority shall verify
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
the ranking submitted by the
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner which comes to you and to
 
00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
this point in time correct me if I'm
 
00:54:26.569 --> 00:54:26.579 align:start position:0%
wrong Greg that you've been doing it
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
based on the criteria that you you that
 
00:54:31.549 --> 00:54:31.559 align:start position:0%
they've been approved by Doe
 
00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
but this would also say in accordance
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
with the criteria defined in
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
subparagraph 2B that's your
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
responsibility as the school building
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
authority elsewhere in statute
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
uh determine if the school district or
 
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School has the financial
 
00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
means and available resources for school
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
building project
 
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
and make a written report of findings
 
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
and submit a list in descending rank
 
00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
order to the State Board of Education
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
for approval
 
00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:03.260 align:start position:0%
if you saw something that you felt was
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
being paid by other available resources
 
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
or they had the you know the financial
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
capability or they didn't have it you
 
00:55:14.809 --> 00:55:14.819 align:start position:0%
could re-rank make a recommendation to
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
re-rank those and then it would come
 
00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
back to the department for their work
 
00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.089 --> 00:55:23.099 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you've had to do that in
 
00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:26.460 align:start position:0%
the past I I've not had to I've you know
 
00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:29.339 align:start position:0%
this new language hasn't hasn't given us
 
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:32.339 align:start position:0%
the ability to do anything like that
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
um this this language I as I read it
 
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
would give us the ability to re-rank
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
based on that all we've had the ability
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
to now is is and I say this kind of half
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
tongue-in-cheek all I've been doing now
 
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
is checking Amy's math
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
um to make sure she's she's added up the
 
00:55:57.770 --> 00:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
points correctly which is unsatisfactory
 
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
to me well you made a visit to Haverhill
 
00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:02.220 align:start position:0%
and looked at the old building so you
 
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
did a lot more there in checking and I
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
did but getting to the timeline here
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not afforded that luxury on 17
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
projects or in and we can't
 
00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
we can't get um
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
our our volunteer team basically
 
00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
um of our part-time team or however you
 
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
want to call a bunch of volunteers to be
 
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
able to take the time to go to all 17
 
00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
properties dealing with the State Fire
 
00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
Marshal the treasury of the state the
 
00:56:35.329 --> 00:56:35.339 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education right we we
 
00:56:39.049 --> 00:56:39.059 align:start position:0%
have things we have other things to do
 
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
now as I look at this let me show you
 
00:56:44.569 --> 00:56:44.579 align:start position:0%
through a virtual meeting
 
00:56:47.809 --> 00:56:47.819 align:start position:0%
um that that may be a a process as well
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
I mean that
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
um I will say even from the Haverhill
 
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
meeting if we had done just to pick your
 
00:56:56.569 --> 00:56:56.579 align:start position:0%
school out even if we had done a virtual
 
00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:58.670 align:start position:0%
school out even if we had done a virtual
meeting

00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
it's not the same as walking as walking
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
the grounds yeah um
 
00:57:06.359 --> 00:57:08.450 align:start position:0%
the grounds yeah um
I

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
I really feel like we are
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
um rearranging the decks on the Titanic
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
here I I don't think
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
we we have the capability of changing a
 
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
few things and giving people different
 
00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:26.510 align:start position:0%
few things and giving people different
Authority

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
I think we need a fundamental rethink of
 
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
it you mentioned some of those in the
 
00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
beginning well we're going to get to
 
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
that okay we were just going to now the
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
the point being right now is that
 
00:57:40.849 --> 00:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
anything we changed on this bill you're
 
00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
not going to see any changes occur until
 
00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:47.579 align:start position:0%
and if the governor signs it and if then
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
it's signed by September uh or or August
 
00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
not to mention the funding right and and
 
00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
yeah and we're dealing with that funding
 
00:57:59.210 --> 00:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
what's the uh the funding then dropped
 
00:58:03.049 --> 00:58:03.059 align:start position:0%
down to Concord which is the next one
 
00:58:03.059 --> 00:58:03.770 align:start position:0%
down to Concord which is the next one
down

00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
um so just so that we don't get
 
00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:08.700 align:start position:0%
sidetracked I think if we just stick
 
00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
with if I just stick with what
 
00:58:11.099 --> 00:58:12.410 align:start position:0%
with if I just stick with what
um

00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
um superintendent I'm trying to I was
 
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
gonna call you representative so
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
superintendent Taylor was saying like I
 
00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:19.790 align:start position:0%
superintendent Taylor was saying like I
think

00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
um correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:58:24.049 --> 00:58:24.059 align:start position:0%
um that what we're talking about right
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
now is on page two the funds received
 
00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
from charitable trust it is just simply
 
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
staying whether we want that allowed to
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
be used as the local match
 
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
um so sixty percent forty percent the
 
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
town the community has to come up with
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
40 do you want that to be able to be
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
allow schools to use other resources as
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
their local match
 
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and the bill would be effective as
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
it's amended
 
00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:56.339 align:start position:0%
um July 2023 so that would apply to all
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
the applicants that I have right now
 
00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's the new ranking or a new
 
00:59:05.809 --> 00:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
system that wouldn't apply to 2025. I
 
00:59:07.609 --> 00:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
don't know what the purpose of this
 
00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
original language was I don't know why
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
I'm either I think it's been in for a
 
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
while it was an attempt to
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
a little bit more than just a rubber
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
stand no no I don't mean that the the
 
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
added language I'm saying the the
 
00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:28.309 align:start position:0%
added language I'm saying the the
um

00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:28.319 --> 00:59:29.049 align:start position:0%
um
the the

00:59:29.049 --> 00:59:29.059 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
funds received from chapter since the
 
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
well I understand well maybe since you
 
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
were around I don't know but it um it
 
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
might be true but I do wonder what was
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
what is the difference if it's paid by a
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
donor or the taxpayers who are I agree
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
burdened it's not we're asking for any
 
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
more money I agree asking for another
 
00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.170 align:start position:0%
more money I agree asking for another
nickel

00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
nickel
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
I suspect it has to do with ownership
 
00:59:58.609 --> 00:59:58.619 align:start position:0%
and you know when it you you've put
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
nothing into it well two things one is
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
the cost can be even higher you're not
 
01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
necessarily as Frugal and two you don't
 
01:00:11.089 --> 01:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
have the care and Etc when you have no
 
01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
ownership and that may have been an
 
01:00:13.619 --> 01:00:15.650 align:start position:0%
ownership and that may have been an
attempt

01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
attempt
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the community was
 
01:00:18.119 --> 01:00:20.089 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the community was
committed

01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
committed
 
01:00:20.099 --> 01:00:20.750 align:start position:0%
committed
um

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
but but what difference would it make
 
01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
to use Amy's phraseology
 
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:31.140 align:start position:0%
um whether this money that pays their
 
01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:32.210 align:start position:0%
um whether this money that pays their
share

01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
share
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
comes from any of these sources or comes
 
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
from the community I I don't I don't see
 
01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:40.859 align:start position:0%
the point I'm not saying that I'm I'm
 
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
just saying I suspect that's where the
 
01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.170 align:start position:0%
just saying I suspect that's where the
original

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
language came from was that concerned
 
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
I did this it was back when Duke
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
albany's and I wrote this thing
 
01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:57.059 align:start position:0%
and that's many years ago at least well
 
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
so we're in a decade so let me ask you
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
um I have not in my time
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
on the board or on the authority no I
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
have not seen and and maybe Amy would
 
01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:14.339 align:start position:0%
recall if there was ever a similar case
 
01:01:18.849 --> 01:01:18.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
that's true but this language has been
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
in here even from old building Aid right
 
01:01:25.609 --> 01:01:25.619 align:start position:0%
and this and it is part of our
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
calculation process almost everybody
 
01:01:29.809 --> 01:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
receives some kind of donation or
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
federal mostly from energy rebate so on
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
our end we don't pay building Aid
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
um on anything and Energy rebates is
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
almost something all of our applications
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
come through with so we subtract that
 
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
off from the top and then we end up
 
01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
applying the rate because of this law
 
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
um so all as that would say is that now
 
01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
Energy rebates federal grants Esser
 
01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
funds any of that money can be used as a
 
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
portion of their local match in order to
 
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
apply for building a whether you all
 
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
want to do that as a different
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
discussion but that's I think that
 
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
that's I think what the question is
 
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:10.970 align:start position:0%
right so
so

01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
listing all of those items
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
this is my personal opinion I wouldn't
 
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
be thrilled about Esser funds going into
 
01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
this I wouldn't be thrilled actually
 
01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:23.270 align:start position:0%
this I wouldn't be thrilled actually
about

01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:02:26.569 --> 01:02:26.579 align:start position:0%
um Energy rebates going into this
 
01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
I would have no no problem however if it
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
in your situation having a local donor
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
um yeah or or
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
um an insurance policy a big Quest a
 
01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
gift any of that doesn't make any damn
 
01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
difference to me at all built their
 
01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:50.339 align:start position:0%
hockey rink I understand this is what
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm saying so I've never had a reason to
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
examine this yeah
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
but given your testimony
 
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
I have no reason to think that that
 
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be stricken from here those
 
01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
lines yeah or at least some at least the
 
01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
I do agree with you as far as Esther
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
grants and other rebates and yeah like
 
01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
that we do have um some potential of a
 
01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
northern borders commission Grant I'm
 
01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
not sure if you're familiar with those
 
01:03:23.089 --> 01:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
uh those are actually Federal flow
 
01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
through funds specifically for depressed
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
parts of your state Southwest and
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
Northwest are the two areas that qualify
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
and they have infrastructure grants
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
which is another again it's unlike Esser
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
for quote it's not covet related at all
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's specifically to rebuilding
 
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in communities municipal
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
or schools and we've been in
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
communication with them and I believe
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
that that Grant would qualify but I also
 
01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying about the
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
others by doing what you're doing here
 
01:03:59.329 --> 01:03:59.339 align:start position:0%
is there savings that you're not going
 
01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
to have to send as many kids over to K N
 
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
for CTE you would keep them in your own
 
01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
building we now have to spend 125
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
000 a year for tuition for those
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
students to go to their CTE Center and
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
they don't send anyone back to us
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:18.890 align:start position:0%
because of
um

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
I guess that they've told us it's
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
because their state doesn't allow them
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
to do so but I don't understand that
 
01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
myself I've even that's the way it's
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
working all over the border at the five
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
CTE centers in Vermont we go there they
 
01:04:35.089 --> 01:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
don't they don't come here yeah so
 
01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
either way it's to us it's not we're not
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
looking for any more funds from the
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
state whatsoever it's just we'd like a
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
little flexibility and I like I said
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
we've already have nearly three million
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
dollars in donations and people have
 
01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
been approaching me and saying they'd
 
01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
like to contribute I'm certain that
 
01:04:57.049 --> 01:04:57.059 align:start position:0%
within six months we could completely
 
01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
cover that local cost
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't help us if we have to
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
ratchet down the overall cost because
 
01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
you know I'd have to raise 16 million in
 
01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
order for there should be no impact on
 
01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers so I think what we can do
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
here is because we have a lot on the
 
01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
docket here today but this component
 
01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:18.059 align:start position:0%
right here we can address through the
 
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
amending language which we're proposing
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
if we can come up with something that
 
01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
might work I kind of agree that some of
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
it may not be needed in this law uh so
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
we we can look at that and we act on
 
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
this next week there's still time to
 
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
that's why we're doing what we're doing
 
01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
here right now understand though that
 
01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:39.059 align:start position:0%
it's quite possible another two years or
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
from now this may be all pass a and
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
we're going through what we see as a
 
01:05:46.849 --> 01:05:46.859 align:start position:0%
transitional step to maybe a
 
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
transitional step determining upon where
 
01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
the pool money is going to come from and
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
and and who's going to have the
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility is it going to be the
 
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
local or is it going to be the state or
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
to what degree uh how do we account for
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
the difference is in communities like
 
01:06:02.349 --> 01:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
your community has a huge difference
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
compared to Waterville Valley right
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
one last thing
 
01:06:11.089 --> 01:06:11.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
um again Financial guy
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
um money is fungible so I I often wonder
 
01:06:20.329 --> 01:06:20.339 align:start position:0%
whether there's not an opportunity for
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
um creativity in
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
um other other than targeting the
 
01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.010 align:start position:0%
um other other than targeting the
donation

01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
donation
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
to this project if there's not a
 
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
possibility of donating to
 
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
someplace else where money that donation
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
can go and that frees up money that can
 
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
be used outside of this language yeah
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
we've actually explored a lot of those
 
01:06:48.599 --> 01:06:49.690 align:start position:0%
we've actually explored a lot of those
okay

01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:49.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
the challenge is that this the way this
 
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
language is written you can't utilize
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
trusts or any other ways of paying for
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
this without taking it off the top
 
01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
um and in order to do sort of a pay down
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
a kind of arrangement that's a poor way
 
01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
of describing it we would have to borrow
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
the money first so that we would have
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
and use it as funds to pay it back I
 
01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
understand we're represent Hill is
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
coming from though because I used to do
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
that with my school budget right the
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
district that if we can offset somewhere
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
else in our operating budget but the
 
01:07:29.329 --> 01:07:29.339 align:start position:0%
money's coming in from somewhere else
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
then we can use those moneys possibly
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
because money is not targeted right and
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
and you utilize it over here our annual
 
01:07:38.089 --> 01:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
operating budget is 7.8 million so we
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
don't have enough play in a budget that
 
01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
small to make this kind of option but
 
01:07:45.049 --> 01:07:45.059 align:start position:0%
you are right and looked at all of those
 
01:07:47.089 --> 01:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
things but number one to do that we have
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
to have the borrow the bond has to be
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
approved then we can pay it down but
 
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
without the bond we wouldn't be able to
 
01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
do that the other thing that I still
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
think needs to be examined
 
01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
um and this
 
01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:03.299 align:start position:0%
I promise you will take us off track but
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
I don't I I won't be far off
 
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
um CTE to me
 
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked at by districts
 
01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:13.430 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked at by districts
um

01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
from a standpoint of whether you
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
um utilizing the existing rsas and uh
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
and having school districts authorize a
 
01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:25.140 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
um similar to spark Academy and in
 
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester authorized a charter school
 
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
use the startup charter school money
 
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
um for CTE and utilize the 100 funding
 
01:08:42.849 --> 01:08:42.859 align:start position:0%
from for charter schools and and and
 
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
segregate your your CTE from the
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
district I guess
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
um previous in a previous District
 
01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire I did something
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
similar it was a small Alternative High
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
School program and in that state you
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
were able to integrate your your Charter
 
01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
into your public school it's not the
 
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
same here in New Hampshire but the
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
difficulty is we don't have space
 
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
and right now the charter school
 
01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:11.219 align:start position:0%
legislation doesn't allow building Aid
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
to be considered it's 100 to pay for
 
01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
your operating expenses but not to build
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
so we wouldn't be able to do that here
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
in this particular case although I'm
 
01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
would be I don't think our community
 
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
would be opposed to that option if we
 
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
had a place to locate the programs so
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
maybe and and this is so maybe those
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
that donation money can can utilize or
 
01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
or locate a a suitable building
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
you know this is this is all part of the
 
01:09:45.169 --> 01:09:45.179 align:start position:0%
moving the pieces around until it fits
 
01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
you know um if you just a thought I'd
 
01:09:49.249 --> 01:09:49.259 align:start position:0%
love to have you visit we had to close
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
our high school because
 
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
safe very old a lot of uh issues that
 
01:09:58.850 --> 01:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
would have cost probably 30 million to
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
repair it wasn't a worthwhile investment
 
01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:02.420 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
there are no other buildings in the town
 
01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
has has commissioner edelblue visited
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
he has visited not recently I think
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
probably about maybe a year and a half
 
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
ago he has he has uh an interesting
 
01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:19.250 align:start position:0%
ago he has he has uh an interesting
story

01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
story
 
01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:20.030 align:start position:0%
story
um

01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.649 align:start position:0%
um
on

01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
a donor
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
that uh in Manchester I think it was
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
that was willing to build a school
 
01:10:30.719 --> 01:10:31.729 align:start position:0%
that was willing to build a school
um

01:10:31.729 --> 01:10:31.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
and and virtually lease it back to the
 
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
community and the school would and the
 
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
district would own the school at the end
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
of 30 years or something like that and
 
01:10:44.689 --> 01:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
Manchester turned it down which seemed
 
01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:48.900 align:start position:0%
the silliest Choice I've ever heard ever
 
01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.830 align:start position:0%
the silliest Choice I've ever heard ever
um

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
but it may be something that you would
 
01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
like to have a conversation with him
 
01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
about and see if there was someone else
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
that with with the available money that
 
01:11:02.209 --> 01:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
in the North country that you've already
 
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
somewhat mentioned or the opportunities
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
for credits I cannot I can't believe
 
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
something like that wouldn't be off on
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
top of it would it be as I said in the
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
beginning a stroke of your pen eliminate
 
01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
this entire section or revise it to
 
01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
allow for the use of charitable trust or
 
01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
donations I wouldn't be a post that
 
01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
would be that would solve our problem
 
01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
immediately and we like I said we only
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
have three years as you know it takes a
 
01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:30.900 align:start position:0%
year to prepare to break ground and
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're breaking ground until next summer
 
01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
so can data be developed to illustrate
 
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
any pattern of affect there may be with
 
01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
potential donors who pulled out of
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
something because of or whatever it
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
seems to me that
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely wrong-headed to penalize
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
the person needing the help because
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
somebody else is willing to help them
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
too to accept that you know we're going
 
01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
to take it away and give it to somebody
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
across the street uh that that isn't the
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
way donors work in my experience what
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
what's the the vote you had you didn't
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
get the votes you needed is that a
 
01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
result that folks feel that the CTE
 
01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
Center came and is still providing the
 
01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
adequate needs for their kids
 
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
no because our CTE Center is very
 
01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
different is uh no none of the programs
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
are duplicated
 
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
um and when we received a girl from the
 
01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
Department about the last year to
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
initiate our CTE program we had three to
 
01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
four hundred people in our
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
cafeteria to speak to commissioner
 
01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
edelblue and explain how strongly they
 
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
supported the CTE concept so I can say
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
unequivocally that there is huge support
 
01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
for the CTE the problem we are having is
 
01:12:58.030 --> 01:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
inflation by costs for food for fuel for
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
and of course our our income is already
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
depressed amongst are you receiving any
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
Carl Perkins money
 
01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
well because we just opened this year no
 
01:13:10.729 --> 01:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
but next year we will and the Carl
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
Perkins amount that they had been giving
 
01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
to Kanan will come to us I don't know
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
what the final allocation is but it's in
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
the realm of around 30 to 40 000 per
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
year so then it sounds like if it's not
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
going to go to Canaan you're not going
 
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
to be sending more kids to Keenan
 
01:13:29.689 --> 01:13:29.699 align:start position:0%
well that's a complicated discussion
 
01:13:31.729 --> 01:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
because supposedly they're an approved
 
01:13:35.689 --> 01:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire region one Center and we
 
01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
are obliged by law to send allow
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
students to attend any Center they
 
01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
choose to attend
 
01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
regard if they're approved so even
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
though they don't send as you mentioned
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
students to ours
 
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
as I said their programs we have only
 
01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
about eight or so students going there
 
01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
now the numbers have really declined
 
01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
because the programs they've had just
 
01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
aren't of interest to our students we
 
01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
have automotive technology which
 
01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
includes Powersports
 
01:14:07.729 --> 01:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
and that's our area right it's all about
 
01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
repairing power sports equipment and
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
diesel mechanics in that one program we
 
01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
have a teacher education program because
 
01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
we have a very difficult time bringing
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
new teachers into our region and we have
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
a lot of our own students who are
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
interested in beginning that career
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
and that's in partnership with white
 
01:14:30.169 --> 01:14:30.179 align:start position:0%
mountain and Plymouth we also have a
 
01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
Health Sciences program which our
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
hospital is a very strong partner with
 
01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
and that enables our students to get
 
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
experience not just as lnas but all
 
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
kinds of career Fields right now we have
 
01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
five students graduating three want to
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
become Physicians
 
01:14:50.209 --> 01:14:50.219 align:start position:0%
your hospital is a uh I'll shoot up
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock right
 
01:14:54.649 --> 01:14:54.659 align:start position:0%
no it's uh offshoot of the Berlin it's
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
um well it's not part of Dartmouth
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock no
 
01:15:00.649 --> 01:15:00.659 align:start position:0%
okay opportunity upper Connecticut
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
Valley Hospital ucbh it's not particles
 
01:15:07.729 --> 01:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
if we were to strike charitable property
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
questions and insurance policies from
 
01:15:12.169 --> 01:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
that line
 
01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:15.500 align:start position:0%
and solve yours issue
 
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
no problem
 
01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:29.390 align:start position:0%
no problem
okay

01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
01:15:34.729 --> 01:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
so let's roll on here we can't guarantee
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
anything but you know you've made your
 
01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
case thank you very very much I
 
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time thank you thank you
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
enjoy the trip back to Pittsburgh yes
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
well I'll be stopping at the office
 
01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
first okay thank you
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
going through this you can see the
 
01:15:51.649 --> 01:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
comments I have in various places and
 
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
the but the primary reason for this
 
01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
because I want to get on some other
 
01:15:57.950 --> 01:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
things to discuss today is that we need
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
to clear up a few areas within it that
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
we had there prior I also have to find
 
01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
out what you think about this section on
 
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
the school building authority but the
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
timeline is imperative that we get
 
01:16:11.450 --> 01:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
something in place or timeline what this
 
01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
time can you explain what the timeline
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
does for us now Amy meaning that what
 
01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
this would happen if this were to well
 
01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
for future applications even if it's
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
just for the next two years how's that
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
going to help both groups here right so
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
essentially again building a changes in
 
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
the future you know that is a probably a
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
separate conversation but for this what
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
it what this does mostly for me and the
 
01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
school districts is it allows them to
 
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
not apply a year in advance it actually
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh requires them or allows them to apply
 
01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
um many months later and so they're
 
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
essentially applying if it were this
 
01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
year they would be applying right now
 
01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
that's a good way to look at it is they
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
would be applying right now then the
 
01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
state budget would come out in the next
 
01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
couple of months and then they would get
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
ranked this fall
 
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
um and then they could know where they
 
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
stand on the list but most importantly
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
they would know how much commitment they
 
01:17:15.890 --> 01:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
can have from the state maybe it's none
 
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
maybe it's some then they are able to go
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
to their warrant their voters with an
 
01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
amount right now they're not
 
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
um Colebrook and all the others on the
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
list just went to their voters without
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
having any idea of money that's going to
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
be appropriated or not so pushing that
 
01:17:34.189 --> 01:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
timeline out
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
further out allows them to apply right
 
01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
now get that determination by this fall
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
go to their voters in the Spring and
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
most importantly if their voters say yes
 
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
then they can start construction when
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
they need to in the spring
 
01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.310 align:start position:0%
they need to in the spring
um

01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
your this current timeline we have right
 
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
now misses out on so many things but it
 
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
misses out on getting the voters to know
 
01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
what they're voting for but it also
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
misses out on the
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
um construction season because July 1st
 
01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
they find out how much money if they're
 
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
going to get any then they've already
 
01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
they can't start song they say can't
 
01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:15.659 align:start position:0%
start construction this summer they have
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
to wait all the way and all of those
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
costs get messed up so this amendment
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
for timeline wise addresses that which I
 
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
think is the main problem there might be
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
other issues but I think that that is
 
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
the State Board of funds by November
 
01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.030 align:start position:0%
the State Board of funds by November
15th

01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
15th
 
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
right and if you put it in terms of this
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
year because it's easier from I think
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
for all of us to understand because
 
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
we're right now talking about the state
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
budget it would mean that November 1st
 
01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
of this year they would have a
 
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
commitment from the state
 
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
um on how much they would be awarded for
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
a building Aid
 
01:18:55.010 --> 01:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
so then it goes before the voters in in
 
01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
next march in the following March and
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
then they can start construction in June
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
so once their kids get out of school for
 
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
some of them anyway that would be a
 
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
benefit to them and then it also repeats
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
that every year I think
 
01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:15.659 align:start position:0%
um we've talked about this before
 
01:19:15.659 --> 01:19:16.729 align:start position:0%
um we've talked about this before
um

01:19:16.729 --> 01:19:16.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
well building Aid is just unstable in
 
01:19:21.169 --> 01:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
the sense of knowing how much money is
 
01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
going to come and I I am uh
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
I I worry that schools are making a
 
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
decision uh on a project that maybe they
 
01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
have embedded fully through their
 
01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
Community or you know because it's this
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
one chance that they get versus having
 
01:19:42.169 --> 01:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
to reapply the following year
 
01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
um because then if they get voted down
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
well then they can just
 
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
listen to their voters and figure out
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
what project can really pass and apply
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
next year rather than waiting two years
 
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
to apply and then apply a year in
 
01:19:56.689 --> 01:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
advance the way it is right now it's a
 
01:19:59.689 --> 01:19:59.699 align:start position:0%
long timeline our current timeline
 
01:20:02.209 --> 01:20:02.219 align:start position:0%
and it causes a lot of uncertainty so
 
01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
for me the big problem I well there's a
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
number of big problems that timeline is
 
01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
is horrendous
 
01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
one or the proposed one
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not
 
01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
qualified to talk on the proposed one is
 
01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:19.550 align:start position:0%
qualified to talk on the proposed one is
yeah

01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the problems that I
 
01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
see is timing is everything in this part
 
01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:33.719 align:start position:0%
of it is
 
01:20:33.719 --> 01:20:34.270 align:start position:0%
of it is
um

01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
who who else is applying in the same
 
01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
year that you are
 
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
um some of this is you know the luck of
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
the draw here of you know you may be in
 
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
a I mean I forget how many were in the
 
01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
process no the year before uh five
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
you see what I'm saying um if you're you
 
01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
know one of 17 versus 105
 
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
um and you're submitting the same amount
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
of money into building Aid
 
01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
um you got to like your chances when
 
01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
you're one of five more so than when
 
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
you're one of 17.
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
but also struck in here is this idea of
 
01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.010 align:start position:0%
but also struck in here is this idea of
um

01:21:19.010 --> 01:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
you know some schools applying for you
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
know 170 million and some schools
 
01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
applying for 13 million
 
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
um you know if you're looking at how
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
many lives you change you can do a lot
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
of those 13 million dollar projects for
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
the kind of like the discussion we've
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
had with with public school
 
01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.270 align:start position:0%
had with with public school
infrastructure

01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
is it is it fair that we don't do 13
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
million dollar projects for
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
um schools like Holbrook when
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
um one project in Concord sucks up you
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
know 170 million
 
01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
um it's part of the conversation that we
 
01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
have to have where money is that we have
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
a cap that's of money the next ticket
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
here on that on the DACA today is to
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
look at that particular concept the
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
other thing I wanted to look at is that
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
so let's say we we approved this year
 
01:22:22.330 --> 01:22:22.340 align:start position:0%
the the Colebrook and uh
 
01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
Monadnock is it that yeah we also hit
 
01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
the Rochester correct
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
what about the ones just down below do
 
01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
they automatically go to the top of the
 
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
list or are they still on the list and
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
have to compete with other schools which
 
01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
may come on the list over the course of
 
01:22:41.649 --> 01:22:41.659 align:start position:0%
the next year
 
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
yes that's isn't it that's it
 
01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:47.570 align:start position:0%
yes that's isn't it that's it
so

01:22:47.570 --> 01:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
two things one you have to remember is
 
01:22:51.890 --> 01:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
so important to remember this when
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
you're talking about projects like
 
01:22:57.290 --> 01:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
Concord and others what you see in front
 
01:23:00.649 --> 01:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
of you is their request not what they're
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
eligible for all schools are eligible
 
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
for cost per square foot per pupil
 
01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
so you know there I think there's a lot
 
01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
of validity in saying a big school might
 
01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:15.410 align:start position:0%
of validity in saying a big school might
be

01:23:15.410 --> 01:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
um a rebuild of a big school might be
 
01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
getting an opportunity like how can we
 
01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
fund that smaller renovation project
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
those are in my opinion valid
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
conversations because they're hard to
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
get to those those re like smaller
 
01:23:31.729 --> 01:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
projects at the bottom of the list
 
01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
because they don't rank as high I think
 
01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:36.300 align:start position:0%
that is a problem how does somebody that
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
just wants to put um a secure vestibule
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
on their building how do they compete
 
01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
with a brand new rebuild because they're
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
in the same competing but when you just
 
01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
talk about all
 
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:52.280 align:start position:0%
um full rebuilds or full new schools
 
01:23:55.490 --> 01:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
then you're really talking about a cost
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
per square foot per pupil and what what
 
01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
the list it takes time for us to review
 
01:24:04.729 --> 01:24:04.739 align:start position:0%
those plans and determine their
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
eligibility and we can't do that as a
 
01:24:10.970 --> 01:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
state one big because it's only me but
 
01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
number two is that the we don't know
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
right now no funding is going to those
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
schools so how much resources do we put
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
into reviewing those applications
 
01:24:24.530 --> 01:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
um so just keep that in mind when
 
01:24:27.169 --> 01:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
there's a big request uh whether it be
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
Concord or or others on the list it's
 
01:24:33.770 --> 01:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
it's likely that a lot of their ask is
 
01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
not going to be eligible for building
 
01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
Aid they play against the same rules as
 
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
the other schools that are building
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
other school districts
 
01:24:44.570 --> 01:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
um so Amy do they automatically go to
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
the top of the list so yeah sorry uh yes
 
01:24:50.930 --> 01:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
they know they do not currently they
 
01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
would if they're
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
um which I think is another problem in
 
01:24:58.729 --> 01:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
the next biennium those 17 projects will
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
only stay on the list if they're voters
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
pass but the state did not have enough
 
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
funds which in theory sounds good if all
 
01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
of the those schools went to their Town
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
vote then you'd kind of get a read but
 
01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
the reality is a lot of those schools
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
are so far down the list that they're
 
01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
just assuming that they're not going to
 
01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
get building AIDS so they've either
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
they've either Knicks their project
 
01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:22.430 align:start position:0%
they've either Knicks their project
altogether

01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
altogether
 
01:25:24.110 --> 01:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
um and maybe some communities have gone
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
forward without the other 14 Schools
 
01:25:29.570 --> 01:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
gone to their voters I think there are
 
01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
some we'll see as these schools start to
 
01:25:35.689 --> 01:25:35.699 align:start position:0%
have their meetings but we'll know at
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
the end of the month whether they'll
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
have some that have gone we've heard
 
01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
about we don't haven't tracked all their
 
01:25:45.130 --> 01:25:45.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.330 --> 01:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
how many of those
 
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
on this list I mean essentially if
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
you're below number five I I don't I
 
01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
don't think that those schools are
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
really even thinking that they're going
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
to get any kind of building Aid that was
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
the other side of that there's always
 
01:26:03.649 --> 01:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
the other side of that coin because
 
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
um two-year two well one session ago my
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
school district
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
um ended up on the top of the list and
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
went to the voters and the voters said
 
01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
no so
 
01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't
 
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
um it's it's just not a guarantee
 
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
um and I've pointed out all the time
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
without having the assurances of whether
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
the voters actually want this
 
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
it's somewhat unfair
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
to make
 
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
the state evaluate all of these projects
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
when we know virtually some of them
 
01:26:46.129 --> 01:26:46.139 align:start position:0%
aren't aren't going to the process
 
01:26:48.649 --> 01:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
aren't going to go to the process
 
01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
there must be a lot of man hours in that
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
women hours and on that too yeah
 
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
um it is
 
01:26:58.610 --> 01:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
good it's good it's also good in my
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
opinion for the Department of Education
 
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
to understand understand those project
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
needs to and be in school buildings and
 
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
understand those projects so they've
 
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
certainly not wasted hours of being in
 
01:27:11.090 --> 01:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
those 17 buildings what is wasted hours
 
01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
is the school districts that have spent
 
01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
money on these applications in time they
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
are difficult applications to put in
 
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
when they have no idea what kind of
 
01:27:23.689 --> 01:27:23.699 align:start position:0%
funding is available which again pushing
 
01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
that timeline helps
 
01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:26.930 align:start position:0%
that timeline helps
um

01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know I was brainstorming this
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
morning on a alternative idea explain
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
your brainstorm and I don't know it
 
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
really is just a brand new idea today so
 
01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.090 align:start position:0%
really is just a brand new idea today so
um

01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
the way lisaid works which is a portion
 
01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:41.750 align:start position:0%
the way lisaid works which is a portion
of

01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
um of 195 198 15 it's for
 
01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:47.930 align:start position:0%
um of 195 198 15 it's for
um

01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
we saved payments for Charter Schools is
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
that it funds everybody on the list but
 
01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
it takes how much is available that was
 
01:27:59.330 --> 01:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
appropriated and takes and prorates
 
01:28:02.689 --> 01:28:02.699 align:start position:0%
everybody that would not work under the
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
current scenario because we don't know
 
01:28:08.689 --> 01:28:08.699 align:start position:0%
um they're applying so well in advance
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
and we don't know how much is
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
appropriated but with a timeline like
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
this it could work I mean I think it
 
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
could work
 
01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:16.729 align:start position:0%
could work
um

01:28:16.729 --> 01:28:16.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
where you know how much money people
 
01:28:21.890 --> 01:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
apply you get your pool of applicants
 
01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
and then you prorate everybody it would
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
do a couple of things that I think would
 
01:28:27.649 --> 01:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
be good is it would Target those smaller
 
01:28:29.209 --> 01:28:29.219 align:start position:0%
projects and note they would no longer
 
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
have to compete we would not have to
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
rank projects that would be
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I think a something if you are
 
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
wondering like you could spread out the
 
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
30 to 60 percent you could really
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
stretch that
 
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
um 20 to 80. you could that way your
 
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
communities start at 20 but then they
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
get prorated based on how much Aid was
 
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
actually approved and maybe they're only
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
going to end up with a 15 award but then
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
those communities that are more at the
 
01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
higher end maybe they're 60 communities
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
or 70 communities and maybe after
 
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
proration they only get 55 or 65 percent
 
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.310 align:start position:0%
proration they only get 55 or 65 percent
Aid

01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
Aid
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
um it would be a way to kind of stretch
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
that out the other thing that would be
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
important in that scenario would be that
 
01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of those votes wouldn't pass and
 
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be able to make changes on
 
01:29:24.770 --> 01:29:24.780 align:start position:0%
the fly like oh no now we are able to
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
give you a little bit more instead you'd
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
have to make that money fall into the
 
01:29:32.090 --> 01:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
next year for the next category for the
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
next proration amount
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
um so with that you'd still have to have
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
a timeline where they're applying like
 
01:29:42.050 --> 01:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
now meaning the the time that the budget
 
01:29:44.330 --> 01:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
is being talked about you'd still have
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
to give them the amount that they were
 
01:29:48.770 --> 01:29:48.780 align:start position:0%
prorated at so that they know how much
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
to go to their voters for and that would
 
01:29:54.169 --> 01:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
stretch out money to reach everybody
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that is even an idea
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
to consider but just putting it out
 
01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.270 align:start position:0%
to consider but just putting it out
there

01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:30:05.209 --> 01:30:05.219 align:start position:0%
I think it needs more fleshing out yes
 
01:30:08.689 --> 01:30:08.699 align:start position:0%
from oh absolutely now because what it I
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
can see I can you know almost instantly
 
01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
think of
 
01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences but I guess they
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
are uh with it may mean if if we had
 
01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
that kind of a scenario there may people
 
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
may have looked at it and said Gee we're
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
going to get money under some money and
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
so now instead of 17 applications you
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
had 54 applications or something like
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
that you know it may encourage because
 
01:30:37.250 --> 01:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
they know if they apply as they
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
understand it it would just be spread
 
01:30:42.850 --> 01:30:42.860 align:start position:0%
out by how many applications yeah
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
refund it and your prorate maybe right
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
you get a buck well then keep in mind
 
01:30:48.649 --> 01:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
that you still would have to be eligible
 
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
for building Aid right I mean there's a
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
lot of things that aren't still
 
01:30:54.050 --> 01:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
evaluation it would yeah I wouldn't say
 
01:30:55.610 --> 01:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
I mean it's still building Aid it's
 
01:30:57.530 --> 01:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
still eligibility and another thing that
 
01:30:59.209 --> 01:30:59.219 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that a lot of people know
 
01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
is that you can't re-apply for building
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
aid for a 35 40 year window so
 
01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:09.780 align:start position:0%
um so you can't just keep putting in
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
applications you can't build a new space
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
thing of it as like credits you you are
 
01:31:19.610 --> 01:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
you get a square foot per person for per
 
01:31:22.729 --> 01:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
student that you get credited uh this is
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
all done on paper but you get credited
 
01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:26.699 align:start position:0%
and if you come in for a building later
 
01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
on and you've used your credits up then
 
01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
you you're that isn't eligible for Billy
 
01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:34.910 align:start position:0%
you you're that isn't eligible for Billy
Aid

01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
Aid
 
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:35.629 align:start position:0%
Aid
um

01:31:35.629 --> 01:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
so if you another example we do have an
 
01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:38.990 align:start position:0%
so if you another example we do have an
application

01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
application
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
um you know you've bought you built a
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
wing in 2010 that gets taken out of new
 
01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
construction and renovation be in the
 
01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
same pot ooh good question
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
well our Renovations are when we talk
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
about Renovations we talk about full gut
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
Renovations that's what's eligible for
 
01:32:01.490 --> 01:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
building Aid and a lot of what's the
 
01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
percentage of building new is it 25 or
 
01:32:08.209 --> 01:32:08.219 align:start position:0%
you know so you can declare something as
 
01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
a a new construction if the cost of
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
renovating exceeds a certain percentage
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
60 but that really just means you need
 
01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
to submit extra documentation okay so in
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh and honestly renovation costs are
 
01:32:24.770 --> 01:32:24.780 align:start position:0%
sometimes more expensive than new costs
 
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
what what I think if you needed to if
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
you wanted to separate separate
 
01:32:30.649 --> 01:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
different categories you wouldn't do
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
renovation and new
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
um you would more do big full rebuilds
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
or re-renovations guts
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
um or the small projects like uh okay
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
Monroe they're a vestibule project
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's a vestibule project so that would
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
be a renovation project correct or
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
whatever oh that's a new that's an
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
addition it's an addition it's part
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
edition part renovation
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so the problem is they can't
 
01:33:01.129 --> 01:33:01.139 align:start position:0%
compete because they're getting security
 
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
points but they're not getting other
 
01:33:06.410 --> 01:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
points on on their list they're not
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
getting consolidation points they're not
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
getting you know
 
01:33:12.770 --> 01:33:12.780 align:start position:0%
um so that's the the the the Crux behind
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
my asking you that renovation projects
 
01:33:17.570 --> 01:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
may not have all those extra points but
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
certainly for that one area
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
they're lacking it might be safety only
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
safety but when we talk about renovation
 
01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
a good example Salem is a renovation I
 
01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
mean that's a renovation project
 
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
um Salem they were on the list last year
 
01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
Salem and Allenstown were selected for
 
01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
building Aid uh Allen Santa's new school
 
01:33:38.050 --> 01:33:38.060 align:start position:0%
and Salem was a
 
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
Renault with new space but they are I
 
01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
mean it's like wall to walls takings
 
01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
back down to the studs when a renovation
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
has to in building a terms it has to
 
01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria called substantial
 
01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:54.780 align:start position:0%
renovation and those are
 
01:33:57.169 --> 01:33:57.179 align:start position:0%
um they are bringing the building up to
 
01:33:59.330 --> 01:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
like new conditions
 
01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
um first is a renovation where you might
 
01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
think with a vestibule really they're
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
renovating they have to move their admin
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
spaces to make accommodations for their
 
01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
new vestibule
 
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
um that is a different project than a
 
01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
substantial renovation project we'd
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
consider that an addition project okay
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
the next part we really ought to get
 
01:34:23.209 --> 01:34:23.219 align:start position:0%
into here is the second part of the
 
01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
amending language and this gets into the
 
01:34:29.689 --> 01:34:29.699 align:start position:0%
concept or the idea are we moving
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
towards another process whatever it
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
might be whether we're flat funding or
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
whether we're putting it totally on the
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
local or whatever we may be doing how do
 
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
we get to that point how do we Wade
 
01:34:45.770 --> 01:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
through all these various ideas that
 
01:34:47.629 --> 01:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
I've heard on the floor you know there's
 
01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:49.380 align:start position:0%
a number of folks saying isn't there a
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
better way you know I'm never going to
 
01:34:53.209 --> 01:34:53.219 align:start position:0%
get something here given the way the
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
formula is set up so if you look on the
 
01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:57.110 align:start position:0%
formula is set up so if you look on the
one

01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:34:58.970 --> 01:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
did I pass this sheet out to everybody
 
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
the amending language one with just the
 
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
amending language no Okay so
 
01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
there there's a copier two and
 
01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:11.750 align:start position:0%
there there's a copier two and
here

01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
you might give one to uh Alicia and to
 
01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:21.410 align:start position:0%
you might give one to uh Alicia and to
Jen

01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
just as a real quick go through here the
 
01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
education commission the state says now
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
we're getting into the question uh we
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
asked Jennifer asked for me do you asked
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
for information about how States fund
 
01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
Capital Construction
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
and we did get this page back it looks
 
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
like this or has the yellow marks on it
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
and and you can see that there's a
 
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:52.860 align:start position:0%
number of ways which are done uh
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
um there and there's examples for States
 
01:35:55.199 --> 01:35:56.629 align:start position:0%
um there and there's examples for States
here

01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:35:56.639 --> 01:35:57.310 align:start position:0%
here
um

01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:00.050 --> 01:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
it gives you some of the percentages and
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
what states do what there's also another
 
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
sheet which I've handed you
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh which is
 
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
it looks like this right here and it
 
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
says well okay they do it through
 
01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
where's the money come from sales tax
 
01:36:20.050 --> 01:36:20.060 align:start position:0%
that's how uh Georgia
 
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
yeah Iowa Virginia then you go to
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
Lottery uh that's uh North Carolina
 
01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
uh these are just examples of States
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
state general funds then you see Ohio uh
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
excise taxes Colorado there's and and
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
there's additional ways of doing it as
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
well that's informational for you
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
um so that this is gonna this is part of
 
01:36:47.689 --> 01:36:47.699 align:start position:0%
the discussion which is in this amending
 
01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
language the amending language has the
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
Amendments we just spoke of with uh
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
superintendent Taylor but you can see on
 
01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
this amending language one on page two
 
01:36:59.709 --> 01:36:59.719 align:start position:0%
and three
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
this would be there would be added to
 
01:37:03.239 --> 01:37:05.110 align:start position:0%
this would be there would be added to
this

01:37:05.110 --> 01:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
this amending lines for 452 to establish
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
the committee long-term sustainable
 
01:37:13.729 --> 01:37:13.739 align:start position:0%
funding formula for school building a
 
01:37:16.370 --> 01:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
and it would be comprised of uh
 
01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
committee members it's not a commission
 
01:37:20.689 --> 01:37:20.699 align:start position:0%
this will be a committee
 
01:37:23.689 --> 01:37:23.699 align:start position:0%
and the committee shall on lines 22
 
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
going on down do those various things
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
um and I I put it out here because it
 
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
we're really I'm open and I think the
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
committee's open to try and find out
 
01:37:38.689 --> 01:37:38.699 align:start position:0%
what do we really want to do
 
01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
the on line 23 on page two it says study
 
01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
methods of ensuring long-term
 
01:37:48.169 --> 01:37:48.179 align:start position:0%
sustainability funding for school
 
01:37:51.050 --> 01:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
buildings and identify any source of
 
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
such funds
 
01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
where is the money coming from that's
 
01:37:57.410 --> 01:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
always an issue B consider whether the
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
state's percentage share of a building
 
01:38:02.570 --> 01:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
Grant age should be a flat funded amount
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
same percentage for all other words or
 
01:38:07.010 --> 01:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
allocated based upon a weighted Equity
 
01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:09.659 align:start position:0%
criteria conditions such as Local
 
01:38:12.169 --> 01:38:12.179 align:start position:0%
District wealth and income we take that
 
01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
into account now grade levels associated
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
with the project the elementary middle
 
01:38:19.129 --> 01:38:19.139 align:start position:0%
geographic location project it projected
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
demographics on and on the list can go
 
01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
see it's an exam examine the fiscal
 
01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
impact benefits on the state and local
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
districts relative to dispersing the
 
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
state allocation share at the beginning
 
01:38:33.649 --> 01:38:33.659 align:start position:0%
of the project through payments then or
 
01:38:35.090 --> 01:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
spreading them out over the term of the
 
01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:36.649 align:start position:0%
spreading them out over the term of the
bond

01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:36.659 align:start position:0%
bond
 
01:38:39.290 --> 01:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
this is just working sort of with the
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
formula which we would have if the
 
01:38:41.639 --> 01:38:43.070 align:start position:0%
formula which we would have if the
currently

01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:38:46.010 --> 01:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
um study IMD study program eligibility
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
criteria and process for prioritizing
 
01:38:51.110 --> 01:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
ranking School building a grants that's
 
01:38:52.850 --> 01:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
looking at our whole process whether
 
01:38:54.850 --> 01:38:54.860 align:start position:0%
that's correct or not
 
01:38:57.890 --> 01:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
examine other state school building Aid
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
programs to determine how those states
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
are funding capital outlay for new
 
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
construction and renovation projects
 
01:39:07.370 --> 01:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
F determine the need for a Statewide
 
01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:09.320 align:start position:0%
facility condition assessment to better
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
know prioritize and project anticipate a
 
01:39:15.169 --> 01:39:15.179 align:start position:0%
10-year Capital expenditures related to
 
01:39:17.149 --> 01:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
school building 8 program
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
G review the building aid application
 
01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
process to ensure prioritization of
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
facility Improvement goals clearly at
 
01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
that that clearly identify the
 
01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
relationship between facility
 
01:39:30.110 --> 01:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
utilization and operational program
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
objectives of the school study any other
 
01:39:35.689 --> 01:39:35.699 align:start position:0%
issues related to school building aid
 
01:39:38.209 --> 01:39:38.219 align:start position:0%
grant procedures that it deems relevant
 
01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
solicit testimony for any any individual
 
01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
or Association that has information on
 
01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:43.189 align:start position:0%
or Association that has information on
it

01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:39:44.930 --> 01:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
there are so many
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
ideas floating out there this is going
 
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
to have to be a committee that would
 
01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
do that it can be done on the side with
 
01:39:53.810 --> 01:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
a task force it could be done through
 
01:39:56.810 --> 01:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
Doe it could be done on the side by a
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
group of people huddling together and
 
01:40:00.590 --> 01:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
and saying well here's here's a proposal
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
where they submit it in the form of
 
01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
their own legislation
 
01:40:06.129 --> 01:40:06.139 align:start position:0%
and that may happen
 
01:40:08.689 --> 01:40:08.699 align:start position:0%
there are it's there there's you know
 
01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:10.139 align:start position:0%
down the southern part of the state
 
01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
there are people who want to get
 
01:40:12.649 --> 01:40:12.659 align:start position:0%
reimbursed of all the things they built
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
um that ain't gonna happen
 
01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
um hope not yeah so here we are how do
 
01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
we how do we go to that next step I'm
 
01:40:26.810 --> 01:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
asking Greg you've been on the school
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
building authority and you've
 
01:40:29.930 --> 01:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
communicated me often some of the
 
01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
concerns and issues that you've seen and
 
01:40:36.110 --> 01:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
and and that we need to address I've
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
done the same thing and Amy's done the
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
same thing too we are the squeaky Wheels
 
01:40:44.810 --> 01:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
um I think it's interesting
 
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
that it seems you know to all things of
 
01:40:52.129 --> 01:40:52.139 align:start position:0%
the season I think it seems that
 
01:40:54.770 --> 01:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
um School building Aid has we've been
 
01:40:57.649 --> 01:40:57.659 align:start position:0%
squeaking enough that um it's now almost
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
reached a fever pitch and we start
 
01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
hearing those same things in a number of
 
01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:03.229 align:start position:0%
hearing those same things in a number of
different

01:41:03.229 --> 01:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:41:05.689 --> 01:41:05.699 align:start position:0%
meeting rooms here we have to do
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
something with school building Aid what
 
01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
well I don't know but I think that there
 
01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
are a number of
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes processes going on and
 
01:41:19.129 --> 01:41:19.139 align:start position:0%
I think we will see
 
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
whether it's this year or next
 
01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:23.330 align:start position:0%
whether it's this year or next
um

01:41:23.330 --> 01:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
new proposals coming out we just heard
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
one today
 
01:41:30.530 --> 01:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
um you know well that was uh it's just a
 
01:41:33.169 --> 01:41:33.179 align:start position:0%
a nighttime dream I understand that's
 
01:41:34.970 --> 01:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
but that's where these things come from
 
01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:38.209 align:start position:0%
but that's where these things come from
and

01:41:38.209 --> 01:41:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:38.219 --> 01:41:39.950 align:start position:0%
 
um personally

01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
um personally
 
01:41:43.609 --> 01:41:43.619 align:start position:0%
I'm not a fan of committees I don't
 
01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
think this approach will will come out
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
with our solution I I so I've just seen
 
01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
enough how do we get to where I think
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
what let me get it coordinated I think
 
01:41:56.930 --> 01:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
uh we are I don't know if it's
 
01:42:00.649 --> 01:42:00.659 align:start position:0%
coordination this is the solution
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
um I think what happens is
 
01:42:06.290 --> 01:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
um there's a number of really bright
 
01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
people when you have 426 people
 
01:42:12.370 --> 01:42:12.380 align:start position:0%
um in a hive
 
01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
knocking into each other which is I
 
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
think one of the benefits of us being
 
01:42:19.729 --> 01:42:19.739 align:start position:0%
here instead of being on Zoom
 
01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
um I think lots of different ideas start
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
percolating I think that's why in the
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
last couple years we didn't see a lot of
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
new ideas come along but but we are I've
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
I've heard five or six that people have
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
asked that talked about already
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
so my guess is the process is happening
 
01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.250 align:start position:0%
so my guess is the process is happening
without

01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:42:45.890 --> 01:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
this kind of a I belong to two different
 
01:42:50.090 --> 01:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
groups already that are ad hoc that are
 
01:42:52.129 --> 01:42:52.139 align:start position:0%
looking at ways of doing something
 
01:42:52.139 --> 01:42:53.209 align:start position:0%
looking at ways of doing something
different

01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:53.219 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
I think that's where the solution is
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
going to come from much more so than
 
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
this because I've never seen for
 
01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
instance a school choice committee that
 
01:43:06.590 --> 01:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
comes out with any kind of a
 
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
um acceptable school choice but we've
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
seen five or six different school choice
 
01:43:15.290 --> 01:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
options come through legislation that
 
01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
just percolated from individual
 
01:43:22.250 --> 01:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
ad hoc committees so that's what I think
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
will happen
 
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
as much as I recognize the work that
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
you've done in this to get here I I
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
personally don't see not a lot of work
 
01:43:32.810 --> 01:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
there it's a string you know that that
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
made us two hours it seems to me that
 
01:43:40.129 --> 01:43:40.139 align:start position:0%
the core requirement needs to be a
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
database that we can all access with the
 
01:43:44.209 --> 01:43:44.219 align:start position:0%
same eyes
 
01:43:46.609 --> 01:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
in other words if we did an assessment
 
01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
Statewide of the condition of the
 
01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:51.719 align:start position:0%
schools and therefore from that when
 
01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
they're likely to need Improvement
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
replacement addition whatever we could
 
01:43:59.930 --> 01:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
make that assumption from that database
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
and then you can start looking at where
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
are you going to need to put money
 
01:44:07.129 --> 01:44:07.139 align:start position:0%
and you have you'll have some concrete
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
data about look it's only going to last
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
17 years so this is when it Bears out
 
01:44:14.330 --> 01:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed or repaired or
 
01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
whatever I think that's true except
 
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
you're assuming
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
that the solution that may come out of
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
some other program
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
is is going to include the state
 
01:44:30.109 --> 01:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
funding of those Solutions you may be
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
one additional step is what I'm saying
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I think most of the people in the
 
01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
state also are assuming that well um
 
01:44:40.370 --> 01:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
whether or not they should it's another
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
old question right it is true I I do
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
think that there are a number of people
 
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.430 align:start position:0%
think that there are a number of people
that

01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:49.609 --> 01:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
that assume that and then you ask
 
01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
why is it we don't do state
 
01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
um building for fire and safety and and
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
they say yeah that's true why don't we
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know so it is
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
I think there is a larger issue
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
I do agree that that would be helpful if
 
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
that existed now
 
01:45:15.229 --> 01:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
um and Amy has done some of that work
 
01:45:17.689 --> 01:45:17.699 align:start position:0%
um you know we've we've scratched out
 
01:45:19.609 --> 01:45:19.619 align:start position:0%
numbers of how many schools there are
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
and how long as they live and all of
 
01:45:24.050 --> 01:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff and come out with a
 
01:45:26.810 --> 01:45:26.820 align:start position:0%
rough estimate but
 
01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:27.470 align:start position:0%
rough estimate but
um

01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
again there's a fundamental question of
 
01:45:33.649 --> 01:45:33.659 align:start position:0%
how involved does the state need to be
 
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
in that issue first and then and then
 
01:45:39.770 --> 01:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
you Branch off that decision tree I
 
01:45:42.590 --> 01:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps may be reacting to my uh cold
 
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
prayers with the other persuasion who
 
01:45:48.169 --> 01:45:48.179 align:start position:0%
always go to the status quo
 
01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
and they consider that the status quo is
 
01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
going to continue forever
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
and so I may be overreacting to that
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
anticipation well the status quo has not
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
continued here we've been through a
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
moratorium there's been no quote uh so
 
01:46:06.530 --> 01:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
here we are now we have situations where
 
01:46:08.209 --> 01:46:08.219 align:start position:0%
we have buildings which were built a
 
01:46:11.090 --> 01:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
hundred years ago that just aren't
 
01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
cutting it or in of course then you have
 
01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
the other one saying well they're only
 
01:46:16.729 --> 01:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
half full so you know figure it out well
 
01:46:18.649 --> 01:46:18.659 align:start position:0%
which is another big piece of this I
 
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
mean it
 
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
um built into that structure
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
into that conversation and I didn't hear
 
01:46:27.410 --> 01:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
it on you in your bill but somewhere in
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
there we need to look at these from that
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%
though that prism of
 
01:46:36.169 --> 01:46:36.179 align:start position:0%
what do these buildings turn into if
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
we're no longer going to have sufficient
 
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
students to fill all of them
 
01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:43.189 align:start position:0%
students to fill all of them
um

01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:46.669 --> 01:46:46.679 align:start position:0%
I know whenever we have schools before
 
01:46:49.629 --> 01:46:49.639 align:start position:0%
the school building a uh Authority
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
generally it's Frank that says what else
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
can this building be looked at and have
 
01:46:56.689 --> 01:46:56.699 align:start position:0%
you looked at what it can be converted
 
01:46:59.090 --> 01:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
to is it an assisted living facility can
 
01:47:01.129 --> 01:47:01.139 align:start position:0%
it be you know something else well I was
 
01:47:02.810 --> 01:47:02.820 align:start position:0%
trying to say the largest growing
 
01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:05.109 align:start position:0%
trying to say the largest growing
demography

01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
demography
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'm there
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
um but I think uh I I think there's a
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
lot of big pieces it's going to be
 
01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
almost impossible I got to believe to
 
01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
have a s a single document solve every
 
01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
issue I I I just can't see that
 
01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:25.310 align:start position:0%
issue I I I just can't see that
happening

01:47:25.310 --> 01:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
um this there's there's how many schools
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
in 600 roughly or four to six hundred
 
01:47:36.050 --> 01:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
yeah um I think there's four to six
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
hundred different solutions
 
01:47:42.050 --> 01:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
um is is the what I'm see on page six of
 
01:47:43.729 --> 01:47:43.739 align:start position:0%
this first document we looked at there
 
01:47:46.450 --> 01:47:46.460 align:start position:0%
was a comment I made on the side
 
01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
and the comment reads discussion item uh
 
01:47:53.689 --> 01:47:53.699 align:start position:0%
offset costs a new construction colon
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
sale amount of previous property or use
 
01:48:05.229 --> 01:48:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:07.970 --> 01:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
but you know so where where does the
 
01:48:09.890 --> 01:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
revenue come from the sale of that
 
01:48:12.109 --> 01:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
property is that go back into new
 
01:48:12.119 --> 01:48:14.570 align:start position:0%
property is that go back into new
construction

01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
um offset the bond or what it's another
 
01:48:20.169 --> 01:48:20.179 align:start position:0%
part of that question isn't it um does
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
to me all of these things are somewhat
 
01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:27.050 align:start position:0%
to me all of these things are somewhat
linked

01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
linked
 
01:48:29.450 --> 01:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
um you know a a charter school is a
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
public school
 
01:48:33.890 --> 01:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
um the public built these traditional
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
Public Schools even if it was a hundred
 
01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:37.930 align:start position:0%
years ago
um

01:48:37.930 --> 01:48:37.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:41.450 --> 01:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
somewhere there's a linking that those
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
children in that traditional public
 
01:48:45.169 --> 01:48:45.179 align:start position:0%
school that are that may be now
 
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
transition to a charter school should
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
have equal access to that same building
 
01:48:53.570 --> 01:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I'll take write my own home Community
 
01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
right now we have the grade school the
 
01:48:57.290 --> 01:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
elementary school in Woodsville which is
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
an older building it's still usable if
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
they can renovate parts of it but it's
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
right across from Walmart
 
01:49:05.570 --> 01:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
on 302 and Route 10 right at the
 
01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:06.470 align:start position:0%
on 302 and Route 10 right at the
intersection

01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
intersection
 
01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
as Prime commercial property yep so if
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
they decide to raise that building tear
 
01:49:12.890 --> 01:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
it down
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
what are they going to get in return for
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
if they sell that property off
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
um would that be then used to towards
 
01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
the new aren't there there's existing
 
01:49:26.450 --> 01:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
rsas on that right for for or in your
 
01:49:28.970 --> 01:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
Charter School your your Charter see if
 
01:49:30.590 --> 01:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
they don't want to go to the Charter
 
01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
School no no no I mean if they're oh
 
01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
well so they want to use that that's a
 
01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
different story but if inside your your
 
01:49:41.330 --> 01:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
document somewhere along the line and I
 
01:49:42.890 --> 01:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
understand there's school districts that
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
don't have because yours is a
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
Cooperative as well
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
well that's a Cooperative of one town
 
01:49:52.669 --> 01:49:52.679 align:start position:0%
yeah but but inside there is a document
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere that's because it does say
 
01:50:01.010 --> 01:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
what happens when you sell that property
 
01:50:03.590 --> 01:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
or it should
 
01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
I I'd have to go look at yeah I know
 
01:50:07.370 --> 01:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
because we brought I think that's
 
01:50:09.530 --> 01:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
questions already in this road and use
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
those portable classrooms at Woodsville
 
01:50:14.330 --> 01:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
Elementary School and those Portables
 
01:50:16.129 --> 01:50:16.139 align:start position:0%
really weren't worth dragging across the
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
street yeah uh but it raises the
 
01:50:21.770 --> 01:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
question so if they want to sell that
 
01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
property off to offset the costs of the
 
01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:25.910 align:start position:0%
property off to offset the costs of the
bond

01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
bond
 
01:50:28.609 --> 01:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
can you can you I don't know I would
 
01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
look at your internal documents first
 
01:50:31.370 --> 01:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
well you're the school building
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
authority you're supposed to be checking
 
01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.659 --> 01:50:40.430 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:46.490 --> 01:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
near the million this this work session
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
is great and I appreciate that yeah but
 
01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
there are a million little questions let
 
01:50:54.169 --> 01:50:54.179 align:start position:0%
me ask a question Amy of you here
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
um so there's a number of ways that we
 
01:50:59.209 --> 01:50:59.219 align:start position:0%
can try to coordinate this so we don't
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
get a lot of disjointed type proposal
 
01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
legislative wise that haven't been
 
01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
thoroughly thought out and that's our
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
job to filter through all that there
 
01:51:11.290 --> 01:51:11.300 align:start position:0%
needs to be a coordinating
 
01:51:13.609 --> 01:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
organization that to me would be the
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education or the
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
01:51:19.010 --> 01:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
if you're going to set up some kind of
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
like you do with curriculum a task force
 
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
to look at how we're teaching
 
01:51:24.890 --> 01:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
mathematics and social studies would it
 
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
not be better to have rather than a
 
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
committee that the department uh set up
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
some kind of a a process where we're
 
01:51:36.649 --> 01:51:36.659 align:start position:0%
going to start looking into sort of like
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
you you've done with these minimum
 
01:51:40.729 --> 01:51:40.739 align:start position:0%
Public School standards
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
um you you had that you contracted that
 
01:51:46.010 --> 01:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
service out is it there's you wouldn't
 
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
have to necessarily do this unless you
 
01:51:49.129 --> 01:51:49.139 align:start position:0%
know you didn't have the time for that
 
01:51:53.629 --> 01:51:53.639 align:start position:0%
but were to look at where is this
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
present building School building aid
 
01:51:59.570 --> 01:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
process working can we tweak this to
 
01:52:02.030 --> 01:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
make it work better we can do some of
 
01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
that right here we will this this
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
timeline has to be done but is are there
 
01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
a number areas in there that are just
 
01:52:12.169 --> 01:52:12.179 align:start position:0%
not doing what we wanted to totally do
 
01:52:14.689 --> 01:52:14.699 align:start position:0%
right now partially do the way we're
 
01:52:16.669 --> 01:52:16.679 align:start position:0%
funding it and it's the funding process
 
01:52:20.209 --> 01:52:20.219 align:start position:0%
correct all that should be discussed but
 
01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
is it better done through the department
 
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh you know that's probably a good
 
01:52:26.330 --> 01:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
question for the commissioner
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
um but my guess is that he probably
 
01:52:30.050 --> 01:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
think would think that that's a good
 
01:52:31.729 --> 01:52:31.739 align:start position:0%
idea I know from other conversations
 
01:52:33.890 --> 01:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
that he's already thinks that it's
 
01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
important for other conversations to
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
come about about how building Aid can
 
01:52:40.370 --> 01:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
can be functioning
 
01:52:41.930 --> 01:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
um and thinking outside the box is
 
01:52:44.209 --> 01:52:44.219 align:start position:0%
definitely his his favorite thing to do
 
01:52:48.169 --> 01:52:48.179 align:start position:0%
as well that maybe it'd be a that's the
 
01:52:49.490 --> 01:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to get this thing done
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
and done you know
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
quickly that could start right now right
 
01:52:57.709 --> 01:52:57.719 align:start position:0%
I think it's going on right now so I
 
01:53:00.830 --> 01:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
think um having that you know I
 
01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
whether our study committee comes up or
 
01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:04.129 align:start position:0%
whether our study committee comes up or
not

01:53:04.129 --> 01:53:04.139 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
um I think that that probably process is
 
01:53:07.850 --> 01:53:07.860 align:start position:0%
going through and my preference is to
 
01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
work with the department and not have
 
01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:11.820 align:start position:0%
another committee right the speaker of
 
01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
the house does not want any more
 
01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
committees right so Rick I know
 
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
I heard what uh Greg was saying
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
and I know that there are numerous
 
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
people talking about putting bills and
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
whatever might it make sense to use all
 
01:53:34.129 --> 01:53:34.139 align:start position:0%
of that legislative creativity but have
 
01:53:36.169 --> 01:53:36.179 align:start position:0%
like a
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
whether it's a clearing house that's
 
01:53:40.850 --> 01:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
what I was thinking Clearinghouse and
 
01:53:43.129 --> 01:53:43.139 align:start position:0%
then I was thinking or just a keeper
 
01:53:46.090 --> 01:53:46.100 align:start position:0%
like a conference or a so you know a day
 
01:53:49.370 --> 01:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
for that set up somewhere for them to
 
01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
all come together and say hey this is
 
01:53:54.290 --> 01:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
this is what I'm thinking this is my you
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
know it's hardly actually submit bills
 
01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
or I think something I think that's a
 
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
hard I I hear what you're saying
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's a hard thing to have people sitting
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
listening to
 
01:54:11.149 --> 01:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
all you know 14 different concepts
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
because you will like one piece out of
 
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
each of them and and you really end up
 
01:54:19.260 --> 01:54:20.689 align:start position:0%
each of them and and you really end up
nowhere

01:54:20.689 --> 01:54:20.699 align:start position:0%
nowhere
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
um where you still need is that
 
01:54:25.729 --> 01:54:25.739 align:start position:0%
individual con
 
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
from that what I would see is someone
 
01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
walking down the hall and saying hey I'm
 
01:54:33.709 --> 01:54:33.719 align:start position:0%
gonna steal that piece that you had on
 
01:54:33.719 --> 01:54:35.750 align:start position:0%
gonna steal that piece that you had on
this

01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:54:38.570 --> 01:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
um would you support it in my idea of
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
doing this which is how
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
right lots of legislation occurs it
 
01:54:45.169 --> 01:54:45.179 align:start position:0%
certainly is and that's why I wasn't
 
01:54:48.410 --> 01:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
sure what form it should take but a form
 
01:54:50.570 --> 01:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
not as a final coming up with a final
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
but just some way of getting all of
 
01:54:56.209 --> 01:54:56.219 align:start position:0%
these people planning these bills to
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
hear what other people are planning so
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
they can do just exactly that oh that
 
01:55:04.250 --> 01:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
would work right in here right well what
 
01:55:06.410 --> 01:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
you're seeing is a piece of that
 
01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
here right now in this kind of a work
 
01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
session and that's where I I kind of
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
disagree that it should be done through
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:55:19.490 --> 01:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
I although I I'm not
 
01:55:21.649 --> 01:55:21.659 align:start position:0%
um opposed to that because I belong to a
 
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
one or two of those but yeah but it is I
 
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
do think that you have a role here too
 
01:55:31.129 --> 01:55:31.139 align:start position:0%
um the chair in House and Senate
 
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
to have a work session or two and bring
 
01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
in one or two people with ideas and and
 
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
discuss those but see there's there's
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
the commission process like public
 
01:55:42.590 --> 01:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure but that's not
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
going to hack it that's not going to do
 
01:55:48.410 --> 01:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
it uh we I I like that the idea of it
 
01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:49.490 align:start position:0%
it uh we I I like that the idea of it
being

01:55:49.490 --> 01:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
the gatekeeper or the Clearinghouse
 
01:55:55.490 --> 01:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
really belongs with the Department of
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
Education or the State Board of
 
01:55:58.850 --> 01:55:58.860 align:start position:0%
Education or somebody that's linked to
 
01:56:00.590 --> 01:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
it I don't think so I don't think so
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
either I I well there's going to be
 
01:56:03.649 --> 01:56:03.659 align:start position:0%
somebody that's going to keep this
 
01:56:05.629 --> 01:56:05.639 align:start position:0%
moving well I think that's the
 
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
legislature yeah because part of the
 
01:56:10.850 --> 01:56:10.860 align:start position:0%
problem are you do have somebody assign
 
01:56:13.010 --> 01:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
that responsibility you could do a
 
01:56:14.990 --> 01:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee just like a work session
 
01:56:16.729 --> 01:56:16.739 align:start position:0%
just like we're doing here
 
01:56:19.609 --> 01:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
put it out publicly and say hey all you
 
01:56:22.129 --> 01:56:22.139 align:start position:0%
guys who are looking at ideas this is
 
01:56:23.689 --> 01:56:23.699 align:start position:0%
the date we're going to do this come and
 
01:56:26.090 --> 01:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
share your ideas
 
01:56:27.890 --> 01:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
that's what I meant by conference or
 
01:56:30.290 --> 01:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
whatever just a chance for people to sit
 
01:56:31.729 --> 01:56:31.739 align:start position:0%
down at the same time I think if you
 
01:56:34.370 --> 01:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
have the doe be the
 
01:56:36.229 --> 01:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
the gatekeeper
 
01:56:36.239 --> 01:56:36.950 align:start position:0%
the gatekeeper
um

01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:41.689 --> 01:56:41.699 align:start position:0%
it's hard in some cases for the doe or
 
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
the people in the doe to have the same
 
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
blunt conversations that we're have that
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:01.370 --> 01:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
ability to communicate and say our ideas
 
01:57:03.410 --> 01:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
we've certainly done it here today well
 
01:57:05.649 --> 01:57:05.659 align:start position:0%
that's what we're saying yeah right
 
01:57:11.629 --> 01:57:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
yeah see well yeah we we could continue
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
to do it in a form like we have here and
 
01:57:19.490 --> 01:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
just keep that process going and then
 
01:57:21.649 --> 01:57:21.659 align:start position:0%
and then run it by and then bring in
 
01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
Frank and say hey what do you think of
 
01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
that we'd have to have meetings posted
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
and we would you know work sessions and
 
01:57:29.209 --> 01:57:29.219 align:start position:0%
we'd have to have you know we'd
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
certainly we'd have to have need for
 
01:57:33.950 --> 01:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
technical support along the way it
 
01:57:36.050 --> 01:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have to be a
 
01:57:38.209 --> 01:57:38.219 align:start position:0%
formalized process it doesn't have to be
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
formalized this is really not formal
 
01:57:43.490 --> 01:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
here no but I um
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
is you can imagine
 
01:57:49.370 --> 01:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
if this room was full
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
um of the usual characters here we
 
01:57:54.350 --> 01:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be having the kind of same
 
01:57:56.510 --> 01:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
conversation that we're having now no
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
because she'd have hope different
 
01:58:02.689 --> 01:58:02.699 align:start position:0%
perspectives but but you would be having
 
01:58:02.699 --> 01:58:03.830 align:start position:0%
perspectives but but you would be having
um

01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
you would be having side conversations
 
01:58:08.089 --> 01:58:08.099 align:start position:0%
you would be having all kinds of things
 
01:58:12.850 --> 01:58:12.860 align:start position:0%
that it's not as productive as small
 
01:58:15.890 --> 01:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
informal groups mainly because a lot of
 
01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
the people who are here have other
 
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
priorities that for them transcend the
 
01:58:22.729 --> 01:58:22.739 align:start position:0%
ones that we're talking about well if
 
01:58:25.250 --> 01:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
their idea is what will this do to the
 
01:58:28.189 --> 01:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
number of people employed to do this and
 
01:58:30.950 --> 01:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
this and that and in this Union and that
 
01:58:32.689 --> 01:58:32.699 align:start position:0%
Union and so forth could be their
 
01:58:35.330 --> 01:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
priorities will be there oh I can
 
01:58:37.609 --> 01:58:37.619 align:start position:0%
guarantee it yeah well I think we've got
 
01:58:39.770 --> 01:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
to be very careful in that you know the
 
01:58:42.290 --> 01:58:42.300 align:start position:0%
they will have ownership in their ideas
 
01:58:44.810 --> 01:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
yes but that's what you want to hear
 
01:58:47.209 --> 01:58:47.219 align:start position:0%
because if we're going to get to where
 
01:58:48.350 --> 01:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
we are going to have something that's
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
going to have some longevity we gotta we
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
got to know that right but if you have
 
01:58:55.850 --> 01:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
that diversity of ideas yeah
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's hard for that type of group to come
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
into a focus of of legislation that's
 
01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
why we don't go to reps Hall and do
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
legislation in reps Hall we do
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislation on your computer and my
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
computer and then we come and testify
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
and try to get consensus that I think
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
you have to have some initial part where
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
you can have different ideas coming
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
forward without one idea being squelched
 
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
and another person bullying this idea
 
01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:34.609 align:start position:0%
and another person bullying this idea
forward

01:59:34.609 --> 01:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:59:37.129 --> 01:59:37.139 align:start position:0%
then what we got to do is try to get a
 
01:59:38.570 --> 01:59:38.580 align:start position:0%
process of whittling it down like you're
 
01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
doing an interview you might have 25
 
01:59:41.629 --> 01:59:41.639 align:start position:0%
people interview for a job you want to
 
01:59:43.129 --> 01:59:43.139 align:start position:0%
get it down to five yeah then you're
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
going to pull those five in then you
 
01:59:45.709 --> 01:59:45.719 align:start position:0%
Whittle it down maybe to three or two
 
01:59:47.689 --> 01:59:47.699 align:start position:0%
then you have to make the final decision
 
01:59:49.490 --> 01:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
so if we ever written legislation like
 
01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
that pardon me how have we ever written
 
01:59:55.070 --> 01:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
legislation yeah it's it's that's no
 
01:59:57.709 --> 01:59:57.719 align:start position:0%
that's management that's that no but you
 
02:00:01.129 --> 02:00:01.139 align:start position:0%
have an example of of this is a whole
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
new thing for for what you're describing
 
02:00:07.609 --> 02:00:07.619 align:start position:0%
and maybe it may be idyllic always
 
02:00:09.250 --> 02:00:09.260 align:start position:0%
before we've always brought a
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
boilerplate forward and so we're going
 
02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
to work off the boilerplate we brought
 
02:00:16.970 --> 02:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
the last goal around in this when I did
 
02:00:19.970 --> 02:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
it we borrowed some stuff from Maine and
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
we brought people in and we started
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
writing this and also basing off what Ed
 
02:00:26.810 --> 02:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
Murdo had in the past over here at
 
02:00:28.729 --> 02:00:28.739 align:start position:0%
Department of Education right and they
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
were basically nobody everything but I'm
 
02:00:34.129 --> 02:00:34.139 align:start position:0%
saying um even let's take some big
 
02:00:37.490 --> 02:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
project like the EFA project
 
02:00:40.129 --> 02:00:40.139 align:start position:0%
um that didn't we didn't all sit in a
 
02:00:40.139 --> 02:00:40.850 align:start position:0%
um that didn't we didn't all sit in a
room

02:00:40.850 --> 02:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
room
 
02:00:45.709 --> 02:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
and get Divergent ideas and get those
 
02:00:48.770 --> 02:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
top five but that doesn't work concept
 
02:00:51.050 --> 02:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
that was new but that's something that's
 
02:00:54.530 --> 02:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
going to need to be the same thing but
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's still dealing with the same topic
 
02:00:59.450 --> 02:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
the brick and mortar of a school we need
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
a new A New Concept just like the EFA
 
02:01:04.970 --> 02:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
was why do we need a totally new there
 
02:01:07.729 --> 02:01:07.739 align:start position:0%
see you're already working like this how
 
02:01:09.410 --> 02:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
do you know it's not working it's
 
02:01:11.410 --> 02:01:11.420 align:start position:0%
working for those that got
 
02:01:14.209 --> 02:01:14.219 align:start position:0%
that's not missing for mostly so it has
 
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
some issues to have to be fixed or or we
 
02:01:20.209 --> 02:01:20.219 align:start position:0%
have to retune the whole thing
 
02:01:22.609 --> 02:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
but we it's we're still dealing with the
 
02:01:25.370 --> 02:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
same topic well this age-old talk to
 
02:01:27.649 --> 02:01:27.659 align:start position:0%
Schoolhouse I can show you back in 1887
 
02:01:30.169 --> 02:01:30.179 align:start position:0%
when the commissioner education said
 
02:01:32.990 --> 02:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's one of our top priorities
 
02:01:35.570 --> 02:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
well efas were dealing with education
 
02:01:38.270 --> 02:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
it's the same topic yeah totally new way
 
02:01:39.649 --> 02:01:39.659 align:start position:0%
of doing it
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I think there are things that uh you
 
02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:45.169 align:start position:0%
and I think there are things that uh you
know

02:01:45.169 --> 02:01:45.179 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
I do think you need
 
02:01:51.169 --> 02:01:51.179 align:start position:0%
um input from look this this project
 
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
that Frank put together or or discussed
 
02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
for Manchester that this public private
 
02:01:57.420 --> 02:01:59.810 align:start position:0%
for Manchester that this public private
partnership

02:01:59.810 --> 02:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
partnership
 
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
um oh
 
02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
that's a whole concept that that needs
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
to be fleshed out and and could be
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
submitted as legislation if if
 
02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
legislation isn't needed
 
02:02:15.530 --> 02:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it was for Manchester
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
it was it was floated to Manchester and
 
02:02:20.570 --> 02:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
Manchester rejected it
 
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
but that's a whole I understand that
 
02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:24.709 align:start position:0%
but that's a whole I understand that
it's

02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
within the building Aid realm but it's a
 
02:02:33.169 --> 02:02:33.179 align:start position:0%
whole new idea of how to provide school
 
02:02:37.689 --> 02:02:37.699 align:start position:0%
buildings to a community or or
 
02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
locate all kinds of things so
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
it is a new idea to take Alicia's
 
02:02:47.870 --> 02:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
comment be because you first have to
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
decide whether you're going to
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
tweak an existing state-funded state
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
directed State coordinated process or
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
you're just going to enable
 
02:03:03.290 --> 02:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
districts to do something and and
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
Innovative and and show them different
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
ways of making that happen it's kind of
 
02:03:10.970 --> 02:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
like the risk pool idea that we came up
 
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
with for special ed funding that is a
 
02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
different idea and just enabling them to
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
do that and that was coordinated through
 
02:03:19.199 --> 02:03:20.149 align:start position:0%
do that and that was coordinated through
whom

02:03:20.149 --> 02:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
whom
 
02:03:20.159 --> 02:03:24.589 align:start position:0%
whom
foreign

02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.599 --> 02:03:27.229 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:03:27.229 --> 02:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:03:29.689 --> 02:03:29.699 align:start position:0%
well yeah well yeah he was very much
 
02:03:31.250 --> 02:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
involved with it you were involved with
 
02:03:35.390 --> 02:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
it uh no I understand uh you're I'm
 
02:03:38.030 --> 02:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
using it as an example of I just think
 
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
that you know you need somebody that's
 
02:03:43.070 --> 02:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
going to give you some support from the
 
02:03:46.129 --> 02:03:46.139 align:start position:0%
management of the whole process
 
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
to that's one way and to ensure that
 
02:03:52.729 --> 02:03:52.739 align:start position:0%
it's going to move forward that it's
 
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
moving forward constructively we're
 
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
we're getting different focuses for
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
different perspectives but and we're
 
02:04:01.010 --> 02:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
also having meetings called and somebody
 
02:04:02.930 --> 02:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
has the responsibility for scheduling
 
02:04:05.209 --> 02:04:05.219 align:start position:0%
meetings all that the management is
 
02:04:08.330 --> 02:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
important can be and or else you can
 
02:04:10.129 --> 02:04:10.139 align:start position:0%
just do it totally on the side but then
 
02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:12.719 align:start position:0%
you lose that air of transparency of
 
02:04:17.089 --> 02:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:19.850 --> 02:04:19.860 align:start position:0%
that sounds more like end process than
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
beginning process when you're
 
02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
brainstorming and we're really in
 
02:04:25.790 --> 02:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
brainstorming part brainstorming no
 
02:04:28.430 --> 02:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
ideas or bad ideas right everybody just
 
02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
puts them out there
 
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
so you do some brainstorming first and
 
02:04:33.890 --> 02:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
let every all those people with their
 
02:04:37.550 --> 02:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
ideas like uh Daniel papavichi Mueller
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
was from and he's on finance too and he
 
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
he's got a completely different idea of
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
how to fund School building Aid right
 
02:04:49.729 --> 02:04:49.739 align:start position:0%
and and there are other people who have
 
02:04:52.129 --> 02:04:52.139 align:start position:0%
other completely different ideas so you
 
02:04:53.930 --> 02:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
do the brainstorming because that's how
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
you come to Solutions is you start with
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
brainstorming and you put all the ideas
 
02:05:01.850 --> 02:05:01.860 align:start position:0%
out there and and and when you put them
 
02:05:03.770 --> 02:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
out there you don't judge any of them
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
yeah and taking that same scenario I've
 
02:05:08.330 --> 02:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
already met with him and he's saying
 
02:05:09.890 --> 02:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
what kind of technical support can you
 
02:05:11.330 --> 02:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
give me in this whole process to better
 
02:05:13.550 --> 02:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
understand something so that's exactly
 
02:05:15.890 --> 02:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for you can't do it
 
02:05:18.589 --> 02:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
in isolation you're going to have to get
 
02:05:20.570 --> 02:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
the support from Amy or from Frank or
 
02:05:23.209 --> 02:05:23.219 align:start position:0%
from you sometimes the transparency that
 
02:05:25.550 --> 02:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
you talk about
 
02:05:28.609 --> 02:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
is is far further down further down the
 
02:05:30.410 --> 02:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
road normal the formal yes it's later
 
02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
down the road but you're still at the
 
02:05:34.250 --> 02:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
beginning you need to have a working
 
02:05:36.890 --> 02:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
administrative type group of some kind
 
02:05:39.770 --> 02:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
that's going to be able to coordinate
 
02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
this and try to get it all together
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
and then you then you're going to have
 
02:05:48.050 --> 02:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
to go through the process a more open
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
process but you have a working group
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I I think that's what we have to
 
02:05:55.490 --> 02:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
have is now how do we form a working
 
02:05:59.570 --> 02:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
group now as a legislature that we can't
 
02:06:01.129 --> 02:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
do we can do it by way commission or
 
02:06:03.410 --> 02:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
committee or we can have work sessions
 
02:06:09.050 --> 02:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.910 --> 02:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
how do we end up having this meeting
 
02:06:13.310 --> 02:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
well I decided we're going to have to
 
02:06:14.810 --> 02:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
have a meeting right put it in the
 
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
calendar got this based on a bill based
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
upon a bill or even if this bill hadn't
 
02:06:23.410 --> 02:06:23.420 align:start position:0%
been here I would have done it exactly
 
02:06:26.570 --> 02:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
exactly so you do the same thing a
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
person could be you
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
could be it could be you
 
02:06:33.410 --> 02:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
says we're going to have this working
 
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
session ask her to come and that gives
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
us her input so all these people who
 
02:06:42.109 --> 02:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
come with their ideas can ask it's the
 
02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
research partion but there's a downside
 
02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
to that too you have people that may
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
come to this kind of a meeting with
 
02:06:52.250 --> 02:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
microphones on and taping
 
02:06:55.550 --> 02:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
that don't want to say things
 
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
um that jeopardize their own Community
 
02:06:57.480 --> 02:06:59.589 align:start position:0%
um that jeopardize their own Community
right

02:06:59.589 --> 02:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:07:03.770 --> 02:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
which may be why some add ad hoc type
 
02:07:05.930 --> 02:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
approach look at the funding commission
 
02:07:07.370 --> 02:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
we just did
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
yeah what that was a a half a million
 
02:07:14.570 --> 02:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
dollars funding and
 
02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
did we have all those services available
 
02:07:21.770 --> 02:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
here in this building
 
02:07:25.189 --> 02:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
where we wouldn't have had to pay what
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
we paid out to car seat and everything
 
02:07:29.209 --> 02:07:29.219 align:start position:0%
yes we got right back there in the back
 
02:07:32.209 --> 02:07:32.219 align:start position:0%
left Empire research that's our research
 
02:07:35.570 --> 02:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
right and that research can be used by
 
02:07:37.609 --> 02:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
that group in other words there there's
 
02:07:39.470 --> 02:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
going to be times when we have to get
 
02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
further than just the
 
02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh right but we have other research
 
02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:46.550 align:start position:0%
uh right but we have other research
um

02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:49.609 --> 02:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
Alternatives yes electric Slater but
 
02:07:51.290 --> 02:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
this is a research that because
 
02:07:54.169 --> 02:07:54.179 align:start position:0%
ultimately down the road we're hoping to
 
02:07:56.990 --> 02:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
make some legislation right which would
 
02:07:59.209 --> 02:07:59.219 align:start position:0%
move us forward but most of the
 
02:08:02.570 --> 02:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
legislation I I think does not come from
 
02:08:07.129 --> 02:08:07.139 align:start position:0%
a work session and and and open and
 
02:08:07.139 --> 02:08:08.930 align:start position:0%
a work session and and and open and
transparent

02:08:08.930 --> 02:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
conversations I think most legislation
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
comes from in the hall talking to your
 
02:08:17.570 --> 02:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
buddy yep or in the cafeteria or in the
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
cafeteria and awful lot comes from there
 
02:08:23.089 --> 02:08:23.099 align:start position:0%
well there's a lot that comes the other
 
02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
way too in fact I look at the bills this
 
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
committee has passed out this year and
 
02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
most of that came through a lot of deep
 
02:08:33.050 --> 02:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
work with other committees and and I'm
 
02:08:35.089 --> 02:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
not saying it came outside I'm saying
 
02:08:38.330 --> 02:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
this you you you have to understand that
 
02:08:40.970 --> 02:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
there are pluses and minuses of both
 
02:08:43.790 --> 02:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
approaches there are and and so I don't
 
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary that you create one
 
02:08:50.930 --> 02:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
pathway for this bill for this ID these
 
02:08:54.410 --> 02:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
ideas to be fleshed out when you're
 
02:08:56.570 --> 02:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
giving up some alternative no all the
 
02:08:58.370 --> 02:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
other stuff is going on concurrently I
 
02:09:01.129 --> 02:09:01.139 align:start position:0%
think so too yeah but then we've got to
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
get all these all these parts put
 
02:09:07.609 --> 02:09:07.619 align:start position:0%
together somehow that's where you need
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
to have that person that's going to call
 
02:09:12.050 --> 02:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
this together and say okay we're working
 
02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
on that now you you come up with your
 
02:09:15.470 --> 02:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts and ideas and praying we're
 
02:09:17.089 --> 02:09:17.099 align:start position:0%
gonna have this General discussion this
 
02:09:19.010 --> 02:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
is where I always thought OLS had
 
02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:20.390 align:start position:0%
is where I always thought OLS had
another

02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:09:23.149 --> 02:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
could have another responsibility which
 
02:09:24.890 --> 02:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial when they sit down
 
02:09:26.689 --> 02:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
with one attorney like he used to sit
 
02:09:29.689 --> 02:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
with Anthony and you could say here's my
 
02:09:31.490 --> 02:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
idea for doing this and Anthony could
 
02:09:33.890 --> 02:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
turn and say have you talked with you
 
02:09:36.410 --> 02:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
know Dan McGuire because he has a
 
02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
similar uh you know I always thought
 
02:09:41.930 --> 02:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
there was a way of of being a connecting
 
02:09:43.729 --> 02:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
system and they do have research too
 
02:09:45.229 --> 02:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
that should go a little farther and then
 
02:09:46.609 --> 02:09:46.619 align:start position:0%
you know you can go over to the archives
 
02:09:49.189 --> 02:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
right I've gone that whole route me too
 
02:09:52.129 --> 02:09:52.139 align:start position:0%
yeah and and it's there's a lot more
 
02:09:53.810 --> 02:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
than we do than just with the Anthony's
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
or the Jefferson no and we do need
 
02:09:58.129 --> 02:09:58.139 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line because you and
 
02:10:00.830 --> 02:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
I aren't going to be here forever there
 
02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:02.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be well I'm not going to be
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
here forever there may be we need to
 
02:10:07.490 --> 02:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
have some way of
 
02:10:10.370 --> 02:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
of passing that institutional knowledge
 
02:10:14.930 --> 02:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
of how to craft a bill a big idea bill
 
02:10:17.629 --> 02:10:17.639 align:start position:0%
um utilizing what's available
 
02:10:20.089 --> 02:10:20.099 align:start position:0%
um you know the good thing is we've got
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
people like Jen and Amy that we rely on
 
02:10:27.290 --> 02:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
that stay here hopefully for a long
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
periods of time but we're not teaching
 
02:10:30.719 --> 02:10:31.609 align:start position:0%
periods of time but we're not teaching
um

02:10:31.609 --> 02:10:31.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:35.209 --> 02:10:35.219 align:start position:0%
freshmen don't have any clue how to they
 
02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
think that every idea that they have is
 
02:10:39.169 --> 02:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
the first time anyone's thought of it
 
02:10:41.330 --> 02:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
and they don't then are surprised when
 
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
it's been brought up 13 times in the
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
past so yeah
 
02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
okay and that's why I was hoping yes you
 
02:10:50.270 --> 02:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
notice none of our freshmen are in there
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
well you know they should be but it is
 
02:10:55.609 --> 02:10:55.619 align:start position:0%
they were invited they were invited yeah
 
02:10:57.169 --> 02:10:57.179 align:start position:0%
they were invited it's just the fact
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
that you know there's a lot going on I
 
02:11:03.410 --> 02:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
think everybody was exhausted after the
 
02:11:04.669 --> 02:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
because we've been do we've been meeting
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
almost every day for the last three
 
02:11:10.609 --> 02:11:10.619 align:start position:0%
weeks well well every day for the last I
 
02:11:15.050 --> 02:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:21.109 --> 02:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:23.629 --> 02:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
yeah get back because but I am going to
 
02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
go forward with with the amending
 
02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
language that we have here for 452 which
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
is relevant to the timeline and to that
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
possible change we have discussed today
 
02:11:36.290 --> 02:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
for the for Cobra are you talking about
 
02:11:38.330 --> 02:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
not the commission one but I mean
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
committee one but this one that we've
 
02:11:42.609 --> 02:11:42.619 align:start position:0%
been looking at
 
02:11:45.050 --> 02:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
yeah the one that we're looking at I'm
 
02:11:47.089 --> 02:11:47.099 align:start position:0%
not going to put the committee on there
 
02:11:49.129 --> 02:11:49.139 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to put everything else on
 
02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
there plus the scratch out of those four
 
02:11:54.109 --> 02:11:54.119 align:start position:0%
words right does that work Amy desk I
 
02:11:55.970 --> 02:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
just um wanted to also point out
 
02:11:58.189 --> 02:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
something I just realized on page four
 
02:12:00.649 --> 02:12:00.659 align:start position:0%
okay which one are you looking at um the
 
02:12:02.450 --> 02:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
regular Amendment not the company right
 
02:12:03.770 --> 02:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
here okay
 
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
um yeah the marked up one
 
02:12:12.370 --> 02:12:12.380 align:start position:0%
um the amendment three two twenty three
 
02:12:14.689 --> 02:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the study commission
 
02:12:16.850 --> 02:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
not I okay I haven't really read that
 
02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
that much but on the one that you have
 
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
for the amended one yeah did this
 
02:12:24.410 --> 02:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
already go through was it already a
 
02:12:26.689 --> 02:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment okay so this is just
 
02:12:31.250 --> 02:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
draft okay so on page four yeah line
 
02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:32.810 align:start position:0%
draft okay so on page four yeah line
five

02:12:32.810 --> 02:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:34.729 align:start position:0%
five
yeah

02:12:34.729 --> 02:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:43.550 --> 02:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:45.530 --> 02:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
yes but the
 
02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
which I handed out
 
02:12:50.569 --> 02:12:50.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:54.169 --> 02:12:54.179 align:start position:0%
here with uh um but it also has the
 
02:12:55.490 --> 02:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
committee on what it does it doesn't
 
02:12:56.750 --> 02:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
include everything in the bill already
 
02:13:00.370 --> 02:13:00.380 align:start position:0%
only has certain amending areas
 
02:13:03.649 --> 02:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
so the just it says beginning July 1st
 
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
of 2025 because this is supposed to um
 
02:13:09.169 --> 02:13:09.179 align:start position:0%
talk about the funding however
 
02:13:12.589 --> 02:13:12.599 align:start position:0%
um schools submit April 1st so I think
 
02:13:14.149 --> 02:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
that you need to make that beginning
 
02:13:17.930 --> 02:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
April 1st of 2025. okay
 
02:13:19.430 --> 02:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
they're actually
 
02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:21.250 align:start position:0%
they're actually
um

02:13:21.250 --> 02:13:21.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
so schools uh the way this amendment is
 
02:13:29.689 --> 02:13:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
should I go ahead
 
02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
um the way this is set up is that
 
02:13:35.330 --> 02:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
schools are applying a couple months
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
before the beginning of the fiscal year
 
02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:39.530 align:start position:0%
before the beginning of the fiscal year
um

02:13:39.530 --> 02:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:41.870 --> 02:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
originally I think originally that used
 
02:13:44.629 --> 02:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
to say July 1st uh the April 1st was
 
02:13:44.639 --> 02:13:45.709 align:start position:0%
to say July 1st uh the April 1st was
pushed

02:13:45.709 --> 02:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
pushed
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
um since that's actually the application
 
02:13:49.970 --> 02:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
do you think perhaps he was talking
 
02:13:51.609 --> 02:13:51.619 align:start position:0%
about a letter
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
no it's just that it's simply that this
 
02:14:00.410 --> 02:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
legislation becomes effective in 2023
 
02:14:03.410 --> 02:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
however the legislation also says
 
02:14:07.250 --> 02:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
beginning July 1st of 2025 meaning our
 
02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
next round of applicants which is
 
02:14:12.530 --> 02:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
correct beginning July 1st of 2025 we're
 
02:14:16.189 --> 02:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
going to start this process but for
 
02:14:17.930 --> 02:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
those that are starting this process
 
02:14:22.250 --> 02:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
they need to submit April of 2025. the
 
02:14:24.649 --> 02:14:24.659 align:start position:0%
third line down that line seven
 
02:14:26.930 --> 02:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
correct uh
 
02:14:29.330 --> 02:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
um so but like yeah if you look at line
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
seven like seven it says April 1st right
 
02:14:37.490 --> 02:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
that April 1st is April 1st of 2025 but
 
02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
it is in a section that doesn't say it
 
02:14:44.750 --> 02:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't start until afterwards right
 
02:14:47.930 --> 02:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
right so either you meant to put that
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
applications were due July 1st which
 
02:14:52.550 --> 02:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
originally was the case but I think he
 
02:14:55.010 --> 02:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
moved that to a couple months earlier
 
02:14:58.669 --> 02:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:00.770 --> 02:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
well that's what I was thinking make it
 
02:15:03.609 --> 02:15:03.619 align:start position:0%
before the April first
 
02:15:06.530 --> 02:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
right you just can't have it be any
 
02:15:10.189 --> 02:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
sooner than any other deadline so
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
um so would there be a problem with
 
02:15:15.310 --> 02:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
saying beginning January 2025
 
02:15:18.890 --> 02:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so
 
02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:26.930 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so
um

02:15:26.930 --> 02:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:29.089 --> 02:15:29.099 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year that immediately
 
02:15:32.089 --> 02:15:32.099 align:start position:0%
precedes the fiscal year
 
02:15:33.950 --> 02:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
which is correct because April 1st is
 
02:15:37.250 --> 02:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year
 
02:15:40.609 --> 02:15:40.619 align:start position:0%
that starts on July 1st April 1st is the
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
preceding fiscal year to the upcoming
 
02:15:42.719 --> 02:15:49.870 align:start position:0%
preceding fiscal year to the upcoming
one

02:15:49.870 --> 02:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:52.490 --> 02:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
split up for today
 
02:15:56.290 --> 02:15:56.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.890 --> 02:15:59.900 align:start position:0%
I was looking at my modifications
 
02:16:03.530 --> 02:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
yeah it was good
 
02:16:03.540 --> 02:16:04.550 align:start position:0%
yeah it was good
um

02:16:04.550 --> 02:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:06.669 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

02:16:06.669 --> 02:16:06.679 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:16:10.189 --> 02:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
yeah sure well I just had to call my
 
02:16:10.199 --> 02:16:12.050 align:start position:0%
yeah sure well I just had to call my
wife

02:16:12.050 --> 02:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
wife
 
02:16:15.470 --> 02:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay so um there's that that's so I won
 
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
or April one January 1st
 
02:16:23.689 --> 02:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
page four line five
 
02:16:27.970 --> 02:16:27.980 align:start position:0%
January January 1.
 
02:16:34.549 --> 02:16:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:34.559 --> 02:16:40.089 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:16:40.089 --> 02:16:40.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's really just an administrator it
 
02:16:45.310 --> 02:16:45.320 align:start position:0%
looks like a thing
 
02:16:48.610 --> 02:16:48.620 align:start position:0%
it's probably Fair ones on the
 
02:16:51.469 --> 02:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
I know there's a whole slug them right
 
02:16:54.190 --> 02:16:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
hey that's just um Technical and then
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
the only other um technical
 
02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.209 align:start position:0%
the only other um technical
um

02:17:02.209 --> 02:17:02.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:05.209 --> 02:17:05.219 align:start position:0%
the only other thing is that um in the
 
02:17:07.129 --> 02:17:07.139 align:start position:0%
previous law and maybe this was done on
 
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
intention and that's completely fine but
 
02:17:13.849 --> 02:17:13.859 align:start position:0%
um it is unclear in this revision what
 
02:17:16.849 --> 02:17:16.859 align:start position:0%
school districts can apply
 
02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
um in general
 
02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
um the only thing I think that you're
 
02:17:22.429 --> 02:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
now including that are not included
 
02:17:24.049 --> 02:17:24.059 align:start position:0%
right now is potentially public
 
02:17:27.589 --> 02:17:27.599 align:start position:0%
academies so if your intent is to
 
02:17:30.290 --> 02:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
include public academies in building Aid
 
02:17:34.310 --> 02:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
now they're not currently eligible which
 
02:17:35.629 --> 02:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure they'd be happy to be
 
02:17:37.370 --> 02:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
eligible but they're not currently
 
02:17:38.990 --> 02:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
eligible because the current law
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
specifically defines what school
 
02:17:44.330 --> 02:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
districts are this law this amendment
 
02:17:45.770 --> 02:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
does not talk about what school
 
02:17:49.490 --> 02:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
districts are if you leave it as is when
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton and Cole Brown ask me if
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for building Aid I will
 
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
probably I think I have to say yes which
 
02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
again I don't have a preference either
 
02:17:59.870 --> 02:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
way I just want to right now the answer
 
02:18:02.209 --> 02:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
is no because the current loss
 
02:18:04.429 --> 02:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
specifically Define school districts as
 
02:18:06.770 --> 02:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
and I can send you the language
 
02:18:08.810 --> 02:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
basically include
 
02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
if this is written this would include
 
02:18:14.049 --> 02:18:14.059 align:start position:0%
Cobra correct and if that's the intent
 
02:18:16.849 --> 02:18:16.859 align:start position:0%
where where is it that that does happen
 
02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
no Mission it's by uh oh mission right
 
02:18:22.669 --> 02:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
now the the amendment just taught says
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
School District there's no definition of
 
02:18:26.509 --> 02:18:26.519 align:start position:0%
school district the current building a
 
02:18:29.629 --> 02:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
law defines school district is a school
 
02:18:31.549 --> 02:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
district is these schools these schools
 
02:18:33.709 --> 02:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
in these schools and public academies
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
are not included on that list so when
 
02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
public academies ask me currently if
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for building Aid I say
 
02:18:42.530 --> 02:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
no because the law excludes them
 
02:18:45.770 --> 02:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
but this does not define that so again
 
02:18:47.389 --> 02:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
02:18:51.889 --> 02:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
and on page two we're good with uh on
 
02:18:58.730 --> 02:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
line five taking charitable trust
 
02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
bequests gifts Insurance yes policies
 
02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:03.169 align:start position:0%
bequests gifts Insurance yes policies
out

02:19:03.169 --> 02:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:19:03.179 --> 02:19:08.270 align:start position:0%
out
absolutely

02:19:08.270 --> 02:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:10.929 --> 02:19:10.939 align:start position:0%
yeah what we had we had yeah
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
from uh Colebrook and they have a
 
02:19:17.450 --> 02:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
situation where the voters up there did
 
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
not approve however they have donors
 
02:19:24.410 --> 02:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
that are willing to provide sizable hunk
 
02:19:27.410 --> 02:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
dollar the local money local money so
 
02:19:29.810 --> 02:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
that should be used
 
02:19:33.410 --> 02:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
frankly the way this is written now
 
02:19:33.420 --> 02:19:40.969 align:start position:0%
frankly the way this is written now
five

02:19:40.969 --> 02:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:43.370 --> 02:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
at the state ground
 
02:19:43.380 --> 02:19:54.130 align:start position:0%
at the state ground
yeah

02:19:54.130 --> 02:19:54.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:58.370 --> 02:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:00.650 --> 02:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
it's not terrible trust me again right
 
02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's been around for years and I don't
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
know why it's really there because that
 
02:20:07.310 --> 02:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
should that should probably come out
 
02:20:09.410 --> 02:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what we're saying yes yes
 
02:20:12.290 --> 02:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
yeah they're very sport because if I
 
02:20:15.170 --> 02:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
mean if there's a generous local donor
 
02:20:17.330 --> 02:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
which they have two million bucks that
 
02:20:20.450 --> 02:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that should that valuation it
 
02:20:22.010 --> 02:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
actually also solves the charter school
 
02:20:28.690 --> 02:20:28.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:35.690 --> 02:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:38.990 --> 02:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
yes and that works for Colebrook yes so
 
02:20:42.290 --> 02:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
leaving federal grants yeah yeah yes
 
02:20:42.300 --> 02:20:45.230 align:start position:0%
leaving federal grants yeah yeah yes
yeah

02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:20:48.650 --> 02:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's been their first months
 
02:20:55.809 --> 02:20:55.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:58.490 --> 02:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
it never has well we only had what six
 
02:21:00.469 --> 02:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
or seven recently Amy and when did you
 
02:21:02.809 --> 02:21:02.819 align:start position:0%
think that was put into a lot of way
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
back yeah as far as I know I mean I've
 
02:21:07.010 --> 02:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
only been with the department since late
 
02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
2015 but that that is my guess is that's
 
02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
just well actually I do know I'm the old
 
02:21:15.290 --> 02:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
building Aid method of uh I've gone
 
02:21:17.389 --> 02:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
through all of their financial
 
02:21:19.250 --> 02:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
um calculations and they always take
 
02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
that off the top of the project so it's
 
02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
been in there for a long time
 
02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
meaning when I get when we get an
 
02:21:27.469 --> 02:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
application we're calculating the
 
02:21:31.010 --> 02:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
well maybe they're trying to save money
 
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
from the states
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
well this so this is one theory is that
 
02:21:39.050 --> 02:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
a lot a long time ago again I don't know
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
the dates on this when you were able to
 
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
receive CTE funding building Aid would
 
02:21:47.870 --> 02:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
pay on the Porsche and so CTE covered 75
 
02:21:52.490 --> 02:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
the remaining 25 building Aid paid 60 of
 
02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
that remaining 25 and somebody said
 
02:21:56.510 --> 02:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna have that happen anymore
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
and might maybe that's when that
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:06.170 --> 02:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
your Amendment would but my guess is
 
02:22:07.849 --> 02:22:07.859 align:start position:0%
that wasn't there and that's why people
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
could get funds on this their CTE
 
02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:11.450 align:start position:0%
could get funds on this their CTE
portion

02:22:11.450 --> 02:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
portion
 
02:22:14.210 --> 02:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
gosh it's okay well we don't need to
 
02:22:15.889 --> 02:22:15.899 align:start position:0%
worry about the history here let's just
 
02:22:21.469 --> 02:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
oh actually according to superintendent
 
02:22:26.570 --> 02:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
Taylor it was not it's not it's not yeah
 
02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's what she said this morning
 
02:22:30.410 --> 02:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
and they've she's been dealing with the
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay are you okay being the school
 
02:22:45.889 --> 02:22:45.899 align:start position:0%
building authority with what's on the
 
02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
bottom page four there in accordance
 
02:22:50.450 --> 02:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
with criteria defined in subparagraph 2B
 
02:22:53.230 --> 02:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
that is the response boys
 
02:22:55.490 --> 02:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
those are the responsibilities that are
 
02:22:58.670 --> 02:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
currently in law yeah you're dealing
 
02:23:01.670 --> 02:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
with the the capability of the the local
 
02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
to fund what they're doing
 
02:23:04.319 --> 02:23:06.849 align:start position:0%
to fund what they're doing
um

02:23:06.849 --> 02:23:06.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:09.950 --> 02:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
from that one
 
02:23:11.809 --> 02:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
line 27.
 
02:23:14.270 --> 02:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
the school billing Authority shall
 
02:23:16.130 --> 02:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
verify the ranking submitted by the
 
02:23:18.170 --> 02:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
commissioner in accordance with criteria
 
02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:27.710 --> 02:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
well I think they ought to do it in
 
02:23:30.070 --> 02:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
accordance with the ranking but also
 
02:23:34.270 --> 02:23:34.280 align:start position:0%
discuss as the financial means
 
02:23:37.610 --> 02:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
well okay if down the road we're going
 
02:23:41.150 --> 02:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
to get into Charter Public Schools oh
 
02:23:43.250 --> 02:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
how do you guarantee that they're going
 
02:23:45.410 --> 02:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
to have the financial ability to
 
02:23:48.610 --> 02:23:48.620 align:start position:0%
maintain so is that only pertaining
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
well any type of I know is that your
 
02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
intention and this isn't opening it to
 
02:23:58.130 --> 02:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
funding jurisdiction no it's it's it's
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
just putting policy in place now is that
 
02:24:03.889 --> 02:24:03.899 align:start position:0%
your intention that was the initial
 
02:24:06.469 --> 02:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
intent nobody's here so let me say it
 
02:24:08.510 --> 02:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
again is your intention that this
 
02:24:10.429 --> 02:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
determining this financial needs and
 
02:24:14.830 --> 02:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:17.630 --> 02:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
to everybody school district for example
 
02:24:19.610 --> 02:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
when looking at Colebrook this morning
 
02:24:21.650 --> 02:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
you know she says we're tapped out what
 
02:24:24.349 --> 02:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
we're 30 bucks per thousand so how am I
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
going to determine
 
02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
that the school district or the charters
 
02:24:32.510 --> 02:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
how is that how do you envision that
 
02:24:35.870 --> 02:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
well I it basically that area statute
 
02:24:37.849 --> 02:24:37.859 align:start position:0%
we're referencing is your responsibility
 
02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
I think they put together a statement
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
from the District of the truck how does
 
02:24:45.309 --> 02:24:45.319 align:start position:0%
the district put together
 
02:24:48.010 --> 02:24:48.020 align:start position:0%
their Finance their
 
02:24:50.450 --> 02:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
something that I can use for financial
 
02:24:52.969 --> 02:24:52.979 align:start position:0%
we determine their financial needs that
 
02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
it would be that it would be subject to
 
02:24:58.990 --> 02:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
um to approval at a uh notice you know
 
02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:00.969 align:start position:0%
um to approval at a uh notice you know
notice

02:25:00.969 --> 02:25:00.979 align:start position:0%
notice
 
02:25:04.010 --> 02:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
right right and so I would have to
 
02:25:06.290 --> 02:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
determine whether the community has no
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
the community determines itself and and
 
02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
it would be subject to
 
02:25:14.990 --> 02:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
um to a vote at um at a
 
02:25:16.849 --> 02:25:16.859 align:start position:0%
School disagreement
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
right well but I wouldn't
 
02:25:22.010 --> 02:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
for the full disc
 
02:25:26.270 --> 02:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so in terms of the timeline
 
02:25:29.450 --> 02:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
if I'm approving the list
 
02:25:31.490 --> 02:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
the district meeting is going to take
 
02:25:31.500 --> 02:25:33.110 align:start position:0%
the district meeting is going to take
place

02:25:33.110 --> 02:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
following six months later sure so so if
 
02:25:40.429 --> 02:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
the district votes down the project then
 
02:25:40.439 --> 02:25:41.870 align:start position:0%
the district votes down the project then
then

02:25:41.870 --> 02:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:25:44.090 --> 02:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
it's not moving forward anyway you still
 
02:25:46.190 --> 02:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
need something but this part takes place
 
02:25:48.410 --> 02:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
six months earlier than that yeah and
 
02:25:49.790 --> 02:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
they would they would have they would
 
02:25:52.010 --> 02:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
they would be saying that I mean the
 
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
project is still subject to a vote at
 
02:25:56.570 --> 02:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
that time right so they're basically
 
02:25:59.510 --> 02:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
saying if the if the project receives
 
02:26:01.790 --> 02:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
the support of the voters then the
 
02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
district does have the financial
 
02:26:05.929 --> 02:26:05.939 align:start position:0%
research well the tax voters but that's
 
02:26:09.290 --> 02:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:11.290 --> 02:26:11.300 align:start position:0%
so I think this language essentially
 
02:26:13.969 --> 02:26:13.979 align:start position:0%
codifying it for school districts
 
02:26:16.730 --> 02:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
well they did for my purposes this is
 
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
talking about me this is saying the
 
02:26:21.290 --> 02:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
school building authority shall verify
 
02:26:23.870 --> 02:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
ciao verified the ranking submitted to
 
02:26:26.450 --> 02:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
the commissioner in accordance with this
 
02:26:28.849 --> 02:26:28.859 align:start position:0%
and I have to determine the finance that
 
02:26:30.410 --> 02:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
the school district has the financial
 
02:26:30.420 --> 02:26:32.510 align:start position:0%
the school district has the financial
means

02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
means
 
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
I don't have that information
 
02:26:37.250 --> 02:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
six months prior to the meeting that
 
02:26:39.230 --> 02:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I think I think
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking past each other well I
 
02:26:43.250 --> 02:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
mean I think we're essentially saying
 
02:26:46.490 --> 02:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
the same thing yeah well hey hang on a
 
02:26:48.590 --> 02:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
second yeah so so what you're doing
 
02:26:51.230 --> 02:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
right now is you're saying okay you're
 
02:26:53.570 --> 02:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh who's your position on the list take
 
02:26:57.290 --> 02:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
it to your voters uh in March and let me
 
02:26:59.450 --> 02:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
know thumbs up or coming soon
 
02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know if it's something and that's
 
02:27:06.170 --> 02:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
what this is saying I I believe as far
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
as school districts for Charters I think
 
02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:16.150 --> 02:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
because I don't see how I am going to
 
02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
determine their
 
02:27:22.610 --> 02:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
uh their financial means until well
 
02:27:22.620 --> 02:27:24.230 align:start position:0%
uh their financial means until well
after

02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
after
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
I've already given my rankings to the
 
02:27:29.210 --> 02:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
school board
 
02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
but your rankings are based upon the
 
02:27:34.010 --> 02:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
criteria same criteria
 
02:27:37.130 --> 02:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
that the department ranked on yes and so
 
02:27:39.170 --> 02:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
you're just basically checking their
 
02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
mathematics yes
 
02:27:45.349 --> 02:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
and and uh yeah and what they did when
 
02:27:47.870 --> 02:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
they they take this over at the the and
 
02:27:50.270 --> 02:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
before and in accordance with criteria
 
02:27:52.429 --> 02:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
defined so you'd be doing the checking
 
02:27:55.490 --> 02:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
of the to verify the rankings and in
 
02:27:55.500 --> 02:27:56.630 align:start position:0%
of the to verify the rankings and in
accordance

02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
accordance
 
02:27:59.150 --> 02:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
with you know what you're responsible
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
for you you do this RSA whatever to be
 
02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
to be there it is
 
02:28:08.030 --> 02:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
determine if that you know so I don't
 
02:28:09.530 --> 02:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
know if this is necessary in here or not
 
02:28:11.809 --> 02:28:11.819 align:start position:0%
this is all add-in it's not there now I
 
02:28:14.690 --> 02:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
don't know how I do it unless it's six
 
02:28:16.910 --> 02:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
months later and I think I've already
 
02:28:19.070 --> 02:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
submitted my report
 
02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
did that
 
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
by October 15th yeah wow that's what it
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
says right here then by November 15th
 
02:28:30.650 --> 02:28:30.660 align:start position:0%
they have to approve yeah that's why
 
02:28:33.290 --> 02:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
we're backing everything off here so so
 
02:28:34.969 --> 02:28:34.979 align:start position:0%
how I don't
 
02:28:37.429 --> 02:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
I still don't know before I stand my
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
paperwork to the board of ed how do I
 
02:28:44.270 --> 02:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
verify that school district's financial
 
02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:45.910 align:start position:0%
verify that school district's financial
means

02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
means
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
so uh just just Greg and I don't always
 
02:28:51.230 --> 02:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
see eye to eye so I'm just going to
 
02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
shout in here that I um I don't
 
02:28:55.490 --> 02:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
understand it either
 
02:28:57.290 --> 02:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
um so we're on the same page here
 
02:28:57.300 --> 02:28:58.490 align:start position:0%
um so we're on the same page here
correct

02:28:58.490 --> 02:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:29:01.309 --> 02:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
um because then all right
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
um I so on the Departments and we
 
02:29:07.070 --> 02:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
receive these applications and to the
 
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
extent possible we ask for their
 
02:29:12.889 --> 02:29:12.899 align:start position:0%
information on their application we do
 
02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
do a check on their debt ratio of their
 
02:29:15.720 --> 02:29:17.030 align:start position:0%
do a check on their debt ratio of their
borrowings

02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
borrowings
 
02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
um and just alert them if they're above
 
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
that I think a seven percent or whatever
 
02:29:24.349 --> 02:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
it is that they're allowed but I'm not
 
02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
really sure what this like what happens
 
02:29:30.010 --> 02:29:30.020 align:start position:0%
if he if there's something you know
 
02:29:32.330 --> 02:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
we've got to submit this to the state
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
board for publication so I'm just not
 
02:29:36.349 --> 02:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
I'm just not clear on what that would be
 
02:29:39.650 --> 02:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
that's all so Amy does a does a does a
 
02:29:39.660 --> 02:29:40.550 align:start position:0%
that's all so Amy does a does a does a
project

02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:29:43.849 --> 02:29:43.859 align:start position:0%
um make it on to the list
 
02:29:46.250 --> 02:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
you know the ranking on the on the list
 
02:29:51.050 --> 02:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
prior prior to receiving uh voter
 
02:29:54.349 --> 02:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
approval correct yes correct okay so so
 
02:29:54.359 --> 02:29:56.870 align:start position:0%
approval correct yes correct okay so so
so

02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:00.110 --> 02:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
I mean I I think because now maybe
 
02:30:02.030 --> 02:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
somebody didn't get on the list for a
 
02:30:04.969 --> 02:30:04.979 align:start position:0%
project that it sorted them six months
 
02:30:04.979 --> 02:30:06.950 align:start position:0%
project that it sorted them six months
later

02:30:06.950 --> 02:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
later
 
02:30:08.510 --> 02:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
say if you're taking the first four
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
projects the fifth project I don't know
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
I only give the one through seven or in
 
02:30:17.389 --> 02:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
this case so 1 through 17. in in the
 
02:30:20.030 --> 02:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
United States the what what what you're
 
02:30:22.130 --> 02:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
saying is you're going to be on the lip
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
ranked on the list and then the question
 
02:30:28.250 --> 02:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
is put to voters in March yeah so after
 
02:30:30.050 --> 02:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
I already that's why after after you've
 
02:30:32.809 --> 02:30:32.819 align:start position:0%
already reported who's on the who's on
 
02:30:34.190 --> 02:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
the list
 
02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:38.290 align:start position:0%
the list
um

02:30:38.290 --> 02:30:38.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and and sometimes the voters need
 
02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
to hear that we're gonna we've been
 
02:30:46.490 --> 02:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
approved for um for safe Mondays prior
 
02:30:49.130 --> 02:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
to well I think voters like to like to
 
02:30:50.570 --> 02:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
know how much they're going to be
 
02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
getting themselves into because they
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
look they're either getting into 100 of
 
02:30:56.690 --> 02:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
the project cost or they're getting
 
02:30:59.450 --> 02:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
themselves into sixty percent and this
 
02:31:01.570 --> 02:31:01.580 align:start position:0%
is the conundrum yeah
 
02:31:04.190 --> 02:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
but this is the also the conundrum that
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
this dead this new timeline fixes
 
02:31:11.450 --> 02:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
good yes it does except except we don't
 
02:31:14.750 --> 02:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
I still don't this part I think I would
 
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
probably I don't know what I'm done what
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
I'm doing here okay here well if it's
 
02:31:22.670 --> 02:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
going to be done by the department then
 
02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
I I got it it's being done somewhere
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
I mean to the extent practical we don't
 
02:31:30.170 --> 02:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
know if the warrant article is going to
 
02:31:33.650 --> 02:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
pass we certainly do not give them money
 
02:31:36.170 --> 02:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
until they have passed a warrant article
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
matter of fact with this amendment
 
02:31:39.710 --> 02:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
there's some language in here that
 
02:31:41.929 --> 02:31:41.939 align:start position:0%
specifically says that there Warren has
 
02:31:44.090 --> 02:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
to be subject to receiving building Aid
 
02:31:46.849 --> 02:31:46.859 align:start position:0%
which is different and that kind of
 
02:31:49.210 --> 02:31:49.220 align:start position:0%
makes sense in this new system
 
02:31:51.770 --> 02:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
contingent well it says subject to
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
receiving building Aid
 
02:31:58.250 --> 02:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
um meaning in in well it says projects
 
02:31:59.690 --> 02:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
with approval from the school district's
 
02:32:01.309 --> 02:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
legislative body to construct not
 
02:32:04.070 --> 02:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
subject to uh not subject to receiving
 
02:32:06.349 --> 02:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
building Aid are eligible but I guess
 
02:32:08.750 --> 02:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's not possible in the current
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
system because the current system you
 
02:32:13.490 --> 02:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
don't know if money is going to be
 
02:32:16.670 --> 02:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
appropriated but in this timeline there
 
02:32:19.250 --> 02:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
like I said now they're applying now the
 
02:32:21.410 --> 02:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
state budget comes out in July they're
 
02:32:23.389 --> 02:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
getting ranked in November they're
 
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
getting going to their voters in March
 
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
and they can go to Construction in the
 
02:32:26.880 --> 02:32:27.670 align:start position:0%
and they can go to Construction in the
spring

02:32:27.670 --> 02:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
spring
 
02:32:30.349 --> 02:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
so this law actually says that they have
 
02:32:33.170 --> 02:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
to have their warrant written
 
02:32:37.130 --> 02:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:40.130 --> 02:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
no no not it's
 
02:32:41.570 --> 02:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
well not if they want to go construction
 
02:32:43.490 --> 02:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
that spring because they don't have to
 
02:32:45.770 --> 02:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
wait for the state budget anymore
 
02:32:49.849 --> 02:32:49.859 align:start position:0%
um can your approval be conditional
 
02:32:52.610 --> 02:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
upon that funding well the article may
 
02:32:55.490 --> 02:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
say that warrant article the then the
 
02:32:57.650 --> 02:32:57.660 align:start position:0%
law currently says it's conditional well
 
02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
well meaning it can't take funding if
 
02:33:08.590 --> 02:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:12.050 --> 02:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
making it conditional fund State funding
 
02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
then you get that the vote from voters
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't actually cut any taxes until
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
until the state funding comes in and the
 
02:33:23.450 --> 02:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
project begins on true language that
 
02:33:26.990 --> 02:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
could be DRL language for that I have
 
02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
always my opportunities one
 
02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
it means that Amy and Regina are not
 
02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:33.969 align:start position:0%
it means that Amy and Regina are not
doing

02:33:33.969 --> 02:33:33.979 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:33:37.490 --> 02:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
evaluation work on on projects that
 
02:33:40.010 --> 02:33:40.020 align:start position:0%
don't have support or Community groups
 
02:33:43.730 --> 02:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
which to me is you yeah this but the
 
02:33:45.230 --> 02:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
town lights
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
by pushing back that part early
 
02:33:50.990 --> 02:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
you're F you're having and especially
 
02:33:53.210 --> 02:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
just take the last couple years trying
 
02:33:55.490 --> 02:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
to estimate What bond rates are going to
 
02:33:58.389 --> 02:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
be that far in advance
 
02:34:02.230 --> 02:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and the construction yeah
 
02:34:05.889 --> 02:34:05.899 align:start position:0%
so that's the deviled egg slower
 
02:34:09.530 --> 02:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure where you gain on one
 
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
side you lose on the other and I'm not
 
02:34:11.520 --> 02:34:12.349 align:start position:0%
side you lose on the other and I'm not
sure

02:34:12.349 --> 02:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:34:14.330 --> 02:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
what's right so how do other states
 
02:34:18.290 --> 02:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
address that wow there it's it we we
 
02:34:20.090 --> 02:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
gave a lot of stuff out on the education
 
02:34:21.889 --> 02:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
Commission State so doing it differently
 
02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
ECS it's different what's the one that
 
02:34:27.969 --> 02:34:27.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:31.130 --> 02:34:31.140 align:start position:0%
well well I'm sure there is something
 
02:34:32.750 --> 02:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
for us there but we haven't read through
 
02:34:35.270 --> 02:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
that all yeah
 
02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
well I guess from that standpoint you're
 
02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:48.410 align:start position:0%
well I guess from that standpoint you're
right

02:34:48.410 --> 02:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
but it is I don't I don't think I know
 
02:34:57.170 --> 02:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
weapon there is that you know oh this is
 
02:34:59.570 --> 02:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
the winner because everyone is doing it
 
02:35:02.510 --> 02:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
differently so there's not clearly not
 
02:35:03.950 --> 02:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
one winner
 
02:35:06.110 --> 02:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know what works here
 
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
and we've only worked really with the
 
02:35:12.410 --> 02:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
one system where we're kind of
 
02:35:15.349 --> 02:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
guessing what what amount is going to be
 
02:35:17.450 --> 02:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
available for the next year and so we're
 
02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
giving almost contingency approval
 
02:35:24.650 --> 02:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
because we're ranking but we don't know
 
02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
I want that brand on the timeline that's
 
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
being proposed in in
 
02:35:34.130 --> 02:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
luckily too when is when is the final
 
02:35:34.140 --> 02:35:36.230 align:start position:0%
luckily too when is when is the final
approval

02:35:36.230 --> 02:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
approval
 
02:35:38.990 --> 02:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
is there a like a final approved by the
 
02:35:41.570 --> 02:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education that's uh
 
02:35:44.690 --> 02:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
November 15th in this November 15th
 
02:35:47.630 --> 02:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
well see January 15th when you have to
 
02:35:50.750 --> 02:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
notify now yes but according to this
 
02:35:53.389 --> 02:35:53.399 align:start position:0%
right here if you're looking on line 15
 
02:35:55.849 --> 02:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
on page five
 
02:35:57.610 --> 02:35:57.620 align:start position:0%
the State Board
 
02:36:00.110 --> 02:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh education shall approved and
 
02:36:01.910 --> 02:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
published a descending rank order list
 
02:36:04.670 --> 02:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
of approved eligible School construction
 
02:36:09.969 --> 02:36:09.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:12.889 --> 02:36:12.899 align:start position:0%
it's also keep in mind this is not the
 
02:36:14.929 --> 02:36:14.939 align:start position:0%
same January that you're talking about
 
02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
or the same November it's forward yeah
 
02:36:19.910 --> 02:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
we didn't move it back we moved it
 
02:36:22.849 --> 02:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
forward so it's really not it's not
 
02:36:26.450 --> 02:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
January it's actually that same December
 
02:36:29.389 --> 02:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
and later not earlier
 
02:36:32.090 --> 02:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
it's all these deadlines are later not
 
02:36:34.370 --> 02:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
earlier right well it's either it's
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
either four months before
 
02:36:40.010 --> 02:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
the the the district meeting
 
02:36:43.070 --> 02:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
for its accurate
 
02:36:45.410 --> 02:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
six months after eight eight months
 
02:36:46.929 --> 02:36:46.939 align:start position:0%
eight months
 
02:36:49.429 --> 02:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
assuming March 15th
 
02:36:52.250 --> 02:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
but see that but the key is that it is
 
02:36:56.389 --> 02:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
the G it is the November of the year the
 
02:36:58.670 --> 02:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
state voted for the budget so it's like
 
02:37:02.090 --> 02:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
if you think of it right now it's this
 
02:37:06.050 --> 02:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
November so money comes in money gets
 
02:37:09.290 --> 02:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
appropriated projects get ranked in in
 
02:37:12.349 --> 02:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
November the list comes out so that
 
02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
voters can go to their so that towns can
 
02:37:18.530 --> 02:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
go to their voters already knowing what
 
02:37:21.050 --> 02:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
the appropriation is for building Aid
 
02:37:23.809 --> 02:37:23.819 align:start position:0%
they're going to their voters in March
 
02:37:26.809 --> 02:37:26.819 align:start position:0%
of the same fiscal year of year one of
 
02:37:29.270 --> 02:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
the biennium and they're actually going
 
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
to go again if they want if they need to
 
02:37:34.130 --> 02:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
but in the old process here January 15th
 
02:37:36.170 --> 02:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
we let them know the warrant articles
 
02:37:38.809 --> 02:37:38.819 align:start position:0%
already being published yeah and and
 
02:37:41.090 --> 02:37:41.100 align:start position:0%
going forward to the voters for their
 
02:37:43.429 --> 02:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
scrutiny and then you can meet in March
 
02:37:46.190 --> 02:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
but even worse as they're going without
 
02:37:49.010 --> 02:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
knowing the state appropriation and with
 
02:37:51.650 --> 02:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
no commitment from the state this allows
 
02:37:55.969 --> 02:37:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:59.330 --> 02:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
in one of these years to make this
 
02:38:03.849 --> 02:38:03.859 align:start position:0%
prospective instead of retrospectively
 
02:38:06.650 --> 02:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
like in this budget in order to make
 
02:38:08.929 --> 02:38:08.939 align:start position:0%
this work in this budget would we have
 
02:38:10.190 --> 02:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
to put in
 
02:38:13.270 --> 02:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
yeah two one look
 
02:38:15.710 --> 02:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
now this the those this doesn't start
 
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
until July 1st 2025 or the change we
 
02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:19.969 align:start position:0%
until July 1st 2025 or the change we
just

02:38:19.969 --> 02:38:19.979 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
the money would be for the projects that
 
02:38:24.110 --> 02:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
we already ranked those those top three
 
02:38:27.290 --> 02:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
projects Rochester Colebrook uh that
 
02:38:29.530 --> 02:38:29.540 align:start position:0%
list that we just have that rank of 17
 
02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
there they would be talking about
 
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
dollars of this state budget for the
 
02:38:37.790 --> 02:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
this month right this month
 
02:38:44.510 --> 02:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
in this is still not knowing that's what
 
02:38:47.090 --> 02:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
the problem is they do not know but the
 
02:38:48.650 --> 02:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
next round we're going to collect
 
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
applications we're not even going to
 
02:38:52.670 --> 02:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
have a list at this time next next
 
02:38:55.250 --> 02:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
budget cycle people are just going to
 
02:38:57.650 --> 02:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
start to apply then the state's going to
 
02:38:59.150 --> 02:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate money
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
um they'll know who it applies but not
 
02:39:04.250 --> 02:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
not taking applications correct before
 
02:39:06.469 --> 02:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
applications over two years now we'll be
 
02:39:08.450 --> 02:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
taking them every year we'll be taking
 
02:39:10.670 --> 02:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
them every year
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
um by April and so in April then the
 
02:39:16.790 --> 02:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
budget comes that money is appropriated
 
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
we can tell people where they are in the
 
02:39:20.510 --> 02:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
list they can go to the voters knowing
 
02:39:22.670 --> 02:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
because we have money already we already
 
02:39:25.370 --> 02:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
have that money and they are waiting
 
02:39:27.830 --> 02:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
instead of them waiting for us we're
 
02:39:29.630 --> 02:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
waiting for them to pass their warrant
 
02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:30.530 align:start position:0%
waiting for them to pass their warrant
article

02:39:30.530 --> 02:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
article
 
02:39:32.450 --> 02:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
subject to receiving building a because
 
02:39:33.710 --> 02:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
they know they'll receive it because we
 
02:39:42.969 --> 02:39:42.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
estimating that far in advance to appear
 
02:39:50.150 --> 02:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's what Juan rates or what what do
 
02:39:51.830 --> 02:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
you mean that first group that first
 
02:39:54.410 --> 02:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
group will be two years from now like
 
02:39:56.090 --> 02:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
picture two years from now we're gonna
 
02:39:57.950 --> 02:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
go because that's when this would come
 
02:40:00.650 --> 02:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
in effect they're gonna be applying in
 
02:40:02.809 --> 02:40:02.819 align:start position:0%
April so next month they'll be applying
 
02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
for construction dollars for the coming
 
02:40:07.550 --> 02:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
spring that's that's good timing for
 
02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:08.990 align:start position:0%
spring that's that's good timing for
them

02:40:08.990 --> 02:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:40:11.270 --> 02:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
versus right now they're like 18 months
 
02:40:15.730 --> 02:40:15.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:18.230 --> 02:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
it'll be a year later which for a
 
02:40:19.490 --> 02:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
construction project isn't that bad
 
02:40:21.410 --> 02:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
right now they're almost two years out
 
02:40:23.330 --> 02:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
what they have to estimate those costs
 
02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
on it's just it's
 
02:40:29.450 --> 02:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
right I received at that 17 the
 
02:40:31.389 --> 02:40:31.399 align:start position:0%
application group of 17
 
02:40:34.070 --> 02:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
they submitted their application to me
 
02:40:38.410 --> 02:40:38.420 align:start position:0%
and the summer of 2020 2022 last summer
 
02:40:41.570 --> 02:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
they are going to completely Miss Even
 
02:40:43.910 --> 02:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
those top three projects they're going
 
02:40:45.290 --> 02:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
to completely miss this construction
 
02:40:47.389 --> 02:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
season because we don't know what money
 
02:40:49.630 --> 02:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
they have
 
02:40:52.429 --> 02:40:52.439 align:start position:0%
right now the money hasn't done money so
 
02:40:55.490 --> 02:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
there if the if money becomes available
 
02:40:58.370 --> 02:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
if they are
 
02:40:58.380 --> 02:41:00.550 align:start position:0%
if they are
yeah

02:41:00.550 --> 02:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:41:04.370 --> 02:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
right they still don't know right they
 
02:41:06.250 --> 02:41:06.260 align:start position:0%
still don't know
 
02:41:09.710 --> 02:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
waiting they still estimated right even
 
02:41:11.809 --> 02:41:11.819 align:start position:0%
under the present day circumstances
 
02:41:13.490 --> 02:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
where the public school infrastructure
 
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
fund remember how we appropriated
 
02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
dollars and even six or seven months
 
02:41:21.770 --> 02:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
later the cost of doing business had
 
02:41:24.770 --> 02:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
doubled right on the sudden if they
 
02:41:27.710 --> 02:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
could find anybody to do the job so so
 
02:41:30.290 --> 02:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
um just a just a thought you know if you
 
02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
keep talking we're talking about
 
02:41:35.690 --> 02:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
um uh voters that that meet either
 
02:41:39.710 --> 02:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
before the the State Board decision or
 
02:41:42.309 --> 02:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
voters that need captions
 
02:41:45.469 --> 02:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
what if we sandwich but if it was
 
02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
preliminary District vote and then a
 
02:41:51.170 --> 02:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
final District vote with board decision
 
02:41:53.929 --> 02:41:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:57.730 --> 02:41:57.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I followed that so
 
02:42:01.790 --> 02:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
preliminary where where the school board
 
02:42:03.830 --> 02:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
um because they're they're you know
 
02:42:05.630 --> 02:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
their design team and their construction
 
02:42:08.330 --> 02:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
team they put it out for bid to get a
 
02:42:10.429 --> 02:42:10.439 align:start position:0%
construction quote you bring it forward
 
02:42:12.650 --> 02:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
to the school district meeting in March
 
02:42:14.330 --> 02:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
15th and I know that doesn't apply to
 
02:42:17.090 --> 02:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
cities and stuff but but but the the
 
02:42:20.990 --> 02:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
idea might apply and and you put on the
 
02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:22.250 align:start position:0%
idea might apply and and you put on the
warrant

02:42:22.250 --> 02:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
02:42:22.260 --> 02:42:23.809 align:start position:0%
warrant
um

02:42:23.809 --> 02:42:23.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:26.990 --> 02:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
um uh would the voters
 
02:42:29.450 --> 02:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
whatever the dra language voters make
 
02:42:31.750 --> 02:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
preliminary approval from a construction
 
02:42:35.389 --> 02:42:35.399 align:start position:0%
project costing no more than I think the
 
02:42:37.070 --> 02:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
number 20 million dollars whatever you
 
02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
get from the um from the contractor less
 
02:42:44.510 --> 02:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
the school district's current building
 
02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:45.950 align:start position:0%
the school district's current building
age

02:42:45.950 --> 02:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
age
 
02:42:49.190 --> 02:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
um ratio is that not not contingency
 
02:42:56.590 --> 02:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:59.990 --> 02:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
so we know where our district sits
 
02:43:01.550 --> 02:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
um in that
 
02:43:04.250 --> 02:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
um subject to state board approval of
 
02:43:07.309 --> 02:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
the building project and final
 
02:43:07.319 --> 02:43:08.150 align:start position:0%
the building project and final
um

02:43:08.150 --> 02:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:11.050 --> 02:43:11.060 align:start position:0%
um approvals
 
02:43:14.210 --> 02:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
yeah because these projects take six to
 
02:43:18.050 --> 02:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
ten years even to get through a
 
02:43:20.570 --> 02:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
School District
 
02:43:23.770 --> 02:43:23.780 align:start position:0%
you know it's like any well you know
 
02:43:27.110 --> 02:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
yeah generally you have multiple years
 
02:43:29.690 --> 02:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
skip to bring it forward so your plan
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
well it depends you know behavioral one
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
went through and uh
 
02:43:36.170 --> 02:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
couple years well I mean you could bring
 
02:43:38.510 --> 02:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
it forward without you know outside of
 
02:43:39.950 --> 02:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
the building a
 
02:43:42.590 --> 02:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
um which is one options and get it
 
02:43:44.389 --> 02:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
through in one year but if you want to
 
02:43:46.370 --> 02:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
do the building age process do
 
02:43:49.130 --> 02:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
preliminary and then find them with with
 
02:43:51.950 --> 02:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
but if you don't do the building aid
 
02:43:53.330 --> 02:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
process you might not get your building
 
02:43:57.290 --> 02:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
Aid because you don't you have to have
 
02:43:59.270 --> 02:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
you can't apply for building Aid after
 
02:44:01.190 --> 02:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
you've started the construction project
 
02:44:04.490 --> 02:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
correct no no and and districts would
 
02:44:06.050 --> 02:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
still be able to make that decision on
 
02:44:07.730 --> 02:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
their own yeah if they want to do it
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
outside would that be part of the
 
02:44:13.130 --> 02:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
preliminary then if some would they vote
 
02:44:16.250 --> 02:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
to do it regardless no well you
 
02:44:18.590 --> 02:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
um well if they started it but they then
 
02:44:21.469 --> 02:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
they no that's the middle Easter but in
 
02:44:24.530 --> 02:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
the preliminary uh bar you know that
 
02:44:26.570 --> 02:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
they say that they have one or two
 
02:44:34.670 --> 02:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:37.610 --> 02:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
and then if without the building agent
 
02:44:39.410 --> 02:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
prove that the school board to move
 
02:44:40.730 --> 02:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
forward with the project
 
02:44:44.389 --> 02:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:48.110 --> 02:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
but no build yeah day five
 
02:44:50.990 --> 02:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
but we're building it any so I was
 
02:44:53.330 --> 02:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
trying to think of in whether it would
 
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
be in a preliminary environment yeah
 
02:44:58.670 --> 02:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
whether they
 
02:45:01.910 --> 02:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
the the you know and this is this I I
 
02:45:04.130 --> 02:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
like this sort of stuff because you know
 
02:45:06.590 --> 02:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
there's put ideas on the table
 
02:45:06.600 --> 02:45:07.330 align:start position:0%
there's put ideas on the table
um

02:45:07.330 --> 02:45:07.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:09.730 --> 02:45:09.740 align:start position:0%
he'd be here all morning
 
02:45:13.910 --> 02:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
but but I think I think it addresses the
 
02:45:15.710 --> 02:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
point you brought up right which is
 
02:45:18.590 --> 02:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
which is and Amy that that you know
 
02:45:21.710 --> 02:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
folks gets failed fast uh Bond rates
 
02:45:25.309 --> 02:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
change fast so so you're always sort of
 
02:45:31.690 --> 02:45:31.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:34.429 --> 02:45:34.439 align:start position:0%
you're basically working with fresh data
 
02:45:38.150 --> 02:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
at the at the time you you apply I mean
 
02:45:40.250 --> 02:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
at the time you do preliminary and then
 
02:45:44.210 --> 02:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:46.790 --> 02:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
okay you think about it well I'm gonna
 
02:45:48.230 --> 02:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
have my lunch here soon because we got
 
02:45:51.650 --> 02:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
another one starting at one uh so I
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
guess I go right back down to the bottom
 
02:45:55.429 --> 02:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
of that page four do we want that
 
02:45:57.110 --> 02:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
language in there or not
 
02:46:00.610 --> 02:46:00.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not you're not a fan either Amy
 
02:46:03.170 --> 02:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
then take it out take it out and it's
 
02:46:04.429 --> 02:46:04.439 align:start position:0%
not that I'm not a fan I just don't
 
02:46:09.950 --> 02:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:11.690 --> 02:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
well I think you're doing it already in
 
02:46:13.809 --> 02:46:13.819 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
preliminary application
 
02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay well I think Charlotte with Charter
 
02:46:18.960 --> 02:46:19.809 align:start position:0%
okay well I think Charlotte with Charter
School

02:46:19.809 --> 02:46:19.819 align:start position:0%
School
 
02:46:22.670 --> 02:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
that's a whole different game and uh
 
02:46:27.010 --> 02:46:27.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:30.530 --> 02:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
okay okay we're on the same page then
 
02:46:32.510 --> 02:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
so that will come out because we got to
 
02:46:36.770 --> 02:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:39.290 --> 02:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
we got we gotta act on it so you're
 
02:46:41.150 --> 02:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
taking out the entire thing are you
 
02:46:42.830 --> 02:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
putting back in well
 
02:46:44.750 --> 02:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
do this on is this on the docket for
 
02:46:44.760 --> 02:46:46.370 align:start position:0%
do this on is this on the docket for
Wednesday

02:46:46.370 --> 02:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
02:46:49.610 --> 02:46:49.620 align:start position:0%
yes yes so it would read the school
 
02:46:51.349 --> 02:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
building authority shall verify the
 
02:46:54.050 --> 02:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
rankings submitted by the commissioner
 
02:46:58.610 --> 02:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
and and and make a uh a written report
 
02:47:00.250 --> 02:47:00.260 align:start position:0%
of findings
 
02:47:06.010 --> 02:47:06.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:08.389 --> 02:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
it just would say and make a written
 
02:47:10.309 --> 02:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
report findings and submit it list in
 
02:47:12.650 --> 02:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
descending rank order to the whatever
 
02:47:14.750 --> 02:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
for approval that's what you're doing
 
02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:17.530 align:start position:0%
for approval that's what you're doing
now

02:47:17.530 --> 02:47:17.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:20.150 --> 02:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
you're just rubber stamping
 
02:47:23.150 --> 02:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
until a new process comes up and then
 
02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:25.610 align:start position:0%
until a new process comes up and then
yeah

02:47:25.610 --> 02:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:47:27.530 --> 02:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
but if we start getting the realm of
 
02:47:27.540 --> 02:47:28.550 align:start position:0%
but if we start getting the realm of
other

02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
organizations like Charters there's
 
02:47:33.710 --> 02:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
going to have to be some real look at do
 
02:47:37.130 --> 02:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to
 
02:47:40.849 --> 02:47:40.859 align:start position:0%
Bond or or pay for it
 
02:47:42.770 --> 02:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
maybe they would have all the donations
 
02:47:44.809 --> 02:47:44.819 align:start position:0%
in the world so representative blood
 
02:47:46.670 --> 02:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
maybe you said this but on page five on
 
02:47:49.070 --> 02:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
that on the top two lines on the
 
02:47:51.410 --> 02:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
strikeout I think that that that and
 
02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
make a written report of findings also
 
02:47:55.730 --> 02:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
needs to be struck out
 
02:47:57.770 --> 02:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
which maybe you already said
 
02:48:00.650 --> 02:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
because it does say it already says and
 
02:48:03.230 --> 02:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
submit I think that written report oh is
 
02:48:04.610 --> 02:48:04.620 align:start position:0%
that is that existing that's correct
 
02:48:07.910 --> 02:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay I just was thinking it says and
 
02:48:09.889 --> 02:48:09.899 align:start position:0%
submit a list what what written
 
02:48:11.150 --> 02:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
reportify what's the difference between
 
02:48:12.830 --> 02:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
a written reporter findings and
 
02:48:15.050 --> 02:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
submitting the list I'm sure that if
 
02:48:17.450 --> 02:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
Greg had made a written reported
 
02:48:17.460 --> 02:48:18.849 align:start position:0%
Greg had made a written reported
findings

02:48:18.849 --> 02:48:18.859 align:start position:0%
findings
 
02:48:22.010 --> 02:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
the financial report this financial
 
02:48:24.889 --> 02:48:24.899 align:start position:0%
means part of the application process
 
02:48:26.570 --> 02:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
um when you say financial means I mean
 
02:48:28.370 --> 02:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
they they state where they are
 
02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
anticipating their funding sources
 
02:48:33.590 --> 02:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
coming from and we do a debt
 
02:48:36.110 --> 02:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
um ratio check with dra you're not
 
02:48:38.030 --> 02:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to spend more uh have so much
 
02:48:40.370 --> 02:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
debt so so you get that information
 
02:48:46.130 --> 02:48:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
and really it's just we use that as a
 
02:48:50.750 --> 02:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
tool in case schools didn't know that I
 
02:48:53.270 --> 02:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
mean hopefully they do but if they if
 
02:48:54.889 --> 02:48:54.899 align:start position:0%
this would exceed their debt we'd want
 
02:49:02.929 --> 02:49:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:04.730 --> 02:49:04.740 align:start position:0%
you really don't need it then it just
 
02:49:06.530 --> 02:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
just submit or listen just any rank
 
02:49:11.150 --> 02:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:13.610 --> 02:49:13.620 align:start position:0%
right and it's fine if it's existing
 
02:49:15.290 --> 02:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
language it hasn't caused any problems I
 
02:49:16.670 --> 02:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
just thought it might be hanging there
 
02:49:21.770 --> 02:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it's only yeah yeah I
 
02:49:23.330 --> 02:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
02:49:25.610 --> 02:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
so you're gonna take out from oh yeah
 
02:49:29.030 --> 02:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's a good point now yeah yeah that's
 
02:49:30.710 --> 02:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
all out
 
02:49:34.130 --> 02:49:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:36.590 --> 02:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
from right after commission School
 
02:49:38.210 --> 02:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
building authority shall verify the
 
02:49:41.330 --> 02:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
rankings submitted by the commissioner
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
and make a written report of findings
 
02:49:44.990 --> 02:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
and submit a list and descending rank
 
02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:52.670 align:start position:0%
and submit a list and descending rank
order

02:49:52.670 --> 02:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:52.680 --> 02:50:01.849 align:start position:0%
 
furniture

02:50:01.849 --> 02:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:04.309 --> 02:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
no that's not if you look that's not in
 
02:50:07.570 --> 02:50:07.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
that isn't part of the funding part he
 
02:50:14.870 --> 02:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:18.349 --> 02:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
well then Okay the reason why it's the
 
02:50:20.929 --> 02:50:20.939 align:start position:0%
reason why it's there is that
 
02:50:24.469 --> 02:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
they can make a rank or a listing based
 
02:50:27.170 --> 02:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
upon different criteria
 
02:50:29.510 --> 02:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
but this right there said they got to do
 
02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
it in conjunction with the same criteria
 
02:50:38.750 --> 02:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:41.210 --> 02:50:41.220 align:start position:0%
the time of this bold new language that
 
02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
on page four right that says in
 
02:50:45.889 --> 02:50:45.899 align:start position:0%
accordance with I think you most likely
 
02:50:47.690 --> 02:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
you added that for clarification because
 
02:50:50.570 --> 02:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
it also repeats itself further down
 
02:50:54.349 --> 02:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
so so that's actually kind of be as
 
02:50:58.910 --> 02:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's not part of the financial means
 
02:50:58.920 --> 02:51:00.969 align:start position:0%
it's not part of the financial means
so

02:51:00.969 --> 02:51:00.979 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:51:03.650 --> 02:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
they'll say same thing done so it's just
 
02:51:07.809 --> 02:51:07.819 align:start position:0%
repeated so I guess it can be sacrifice
 
02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
read the sentence before that yeah yeah
 
02:51:13.030 --> 02:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
it said
 
02:51:15.469 --> 02:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
a little bit later on in the following
 
02:51:18.889 --> 02:51:18.899 align:start position:0%
you have to but yeah it's already it's
 
02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
already there
 
02:51:23.570 --> 02:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
duplicative at best
 
02:51:26.210 --> 02:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
yeah all the bull prank except for maybe
 
02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
that and
 
02:51:31.070 --> 02:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
well you could take up all the Bold at
 
02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:36.830 --> 02:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
building authority shall verify the
 
02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
rankings emitted by the commissioners
 
02:51:48.790 --> 02:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:51.469 --> 02:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
and then it says right after that if the
 
02:52:01.150 --> 02:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:10.610 --> 02:52:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:16.210 --> 02:52:16.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:18.349 --> 02:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
and then representative that is super
 
02:52:18.359 --> 02:52:19.429 align:start position:0%
and then representative that is super
minor

02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
minor
 
02:52:22.250 --> 02:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
um where are you know on page six
 
02:52:24.830 --> 02:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
um at the bottom it's a Roman numeral
 
02:52:26.870 --> 02:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
thing line 25 I think that's supposed to
 
02:52:30.710 --> 02:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
be on line 25 page six I think that's
 
02:52:32.269 --> 02:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
supposed to be Roman numeral three which
 
02:52:35.030 --> 02:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sure somebody would eventually
 
02:52:36.710 --> 02:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
which means maybe the other Roman
 
02:52:39.469 --> 02:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
numerals are
 
02:52:43.370 --> 02:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
four should be three one two yes it
 
02:52:46.370 --> 02:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:51.309 --> 02:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:55.370 --> 02:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
does this have the agent too yeah it
 
02:52:58.490 --> 02:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:01.670 --> 02:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
so then and then there's four on page
 
02:53:01.680 --> 02:53:06.410 align:start position:0%
so then and then there's four on page
seven

02:53:06.410 --> 02:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:10.550 --> 02:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
no no no no see just note it and then as
 
02:53:12.349 --> 02:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
you work through just yeah yeah
 
02:53:14.809 --> 02:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
basically it'd be three then four and
 
02:53:23.530 --> 02:53:23.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:26.630 --> 02:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right
 
02:53:29.809 --> 02:53:29.819 align:start position:0%
for all of us yeah
 
02:53:32.269 --> 02:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
well I can look and see what OLS did do
 
02:53:34.730 --> 02:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
because we
 
02:53:38.410 --> 02:53:38.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:40.610 --> 02:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
we need to really have it over there
 
02:53:43.250 --> 02:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
right off here today
 
02:53:43.260 --> 02:53:44.690 align:start position:0%
right off here today
um

02:53:44.690 --> 02:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:47.929 --> 02:53:47.939 align:start position:0%
yeah we I mean and I'm gonna try to get
 
02:53:49.670 --> 02:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
Jeff to do this
 
02:53:54.050 --> 02:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
oh yeah how do you want to
 
02:53:57.590 --> 02:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
treat this with respect to what's at hv2
 
02:54:09.950 --> 02:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:14.150 --> 02:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:17.750 --> 02:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
and what I I believe because I did have
 
02:54:19.550 --> 02:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
a conversation with her I think that she
 
02:54:22.070 --> 02:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
was just sharing that information
 
02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
um since
 
02:54:27.410 --> 02:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
I don't recall if there's anything in
 
02:54:27.420 --> 02:54:29.510 align:start position:0%
I don't recall if there's anything in
there

02:54:29.510 --> 02:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:40.790 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:54:40.790 --> 02:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:42.469 --> 02:54:42.479 align:start position:0%
because that's more of the funding
 
02:54:44.389 --> 02:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
structure for the other three bills that
 
02:54:46.770 --> 02:54:46.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:46.780 --> 02:54:50.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:54:50.870 --> 02:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:53.230 --> 02:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
I'll have to look at that
 
02:54:56.150 --> 02:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
school 2026.
 
02:54:58.610 --> 02:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
I have had um
 
02:55:01.190 --> 02:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
ETF rollover
 
02:55:02.809 --> 02:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
oh maybe I'm I'm thinking of something
 
02:55:07.630 --> 02:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:23.330 --> 02:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:25.190 --> 02:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
I can't believe they would do that right
 
02:55:30.790 --> 02:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:34.370 --> 02:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
no it doesn't it doesn't touch the you
 
02:55:36.469 --> 02:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
know schedule
 
02:55:38.570 --> 02:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
um but that's something I wanted to talk
 
02:55:40.670 --> 02:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
about I mean obviously over time the
 
02:55:43.250 --> 02:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
people who knew so many projects but but
 
02:55:46.250 --> 02:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
the question is how many you know you
 
02:55:49.309 --> 02:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
wanted do you want to do what same
 
02:55:51.650 --> 02:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
amount every year or do you want to pick
 
02:55:55.429 --> 02:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
up some more early Pro projects earlier
 
02:55:57.050 --> 02:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
in the cycle given in fact we've had a
 
02:55:57.060 --> 02:55:58.610 align:start position:0%
in the cycle given in fact we've had a
decade

02:55:58.610 --> 02:55:58.620 align:start position:0%
decade
 
02:56:02.570 --> 02:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
well I don't I don't personally I don't
 
02:56:05.630 --> 02:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
think you can look it I think that
 
02:56:08.150 --> 02:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
you're seeing those projects that were
 
02:56:12.469 --> 02:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
affected by by the receipts 17. when we
 
02:56:14.990 --> 02:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
didn't see five right only five right
 
02:56:17.210 --> 02:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
every year but
 
02:56:20.269 --> 02:56:20.279 align:start position:0%
but I don't um this
 
02:56:23.269 --> 02:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
this we had a slight conversation
 
02:56:26.929 --> 02:56:26.939 align:start position:0%
earlier what you have um
 
02:56:29.990 --> 02:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
the way of being able to take care of a
 
02:56:32.269 --> 02:56:32.279 align:start position:0%
smaller projects you know take care of
 
02:56:32.279 --> 02:56:33.769 align:start position:0%
smaller projects you know take care of
five

02:56:33.769 --> 02:56:33.779 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:56:38.750 --> 02:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
um smaller tools and then one conquerors
 
02:56:42.410 --> 02:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
can equal those five you know where
 
02:56:45.349 --> 02:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
where did my ranking
 
02:56:47.330 --> 02:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
but you know yeah when you're looking at
 
02:56:49.550 --> 02:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
it from a
 
02:56:52.010 --> 02:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
I just hearing responsibility standpoint
 
02:56:54.110 --> 02:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
you're trying to say gee who am I am I
 
02:56:57.349 --> 02:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
talking more people by doing five small
 
02:57:09.070 --> 02:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:13.969 --> 02:57:13.979 align:start position:0%
20 years as opposed to one year then you
 
02:57:16.370 --> 02:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
can get more upfront well that's a
 
02:57:20.110 --> 02:57:20.120 align:start position:0%
demonstrated dwindle as you yeah
 
02:57:20.120 --> 02:57:23.769 align:start position:0%
demonstrated dwindle as you yeah
yeah

02:57:23.769 --> 02:57:23.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:31.210 --> 02:57:31.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:34.809 --> 02:57:34.819 align:start position:0%
yes and
 
02:57:38.570 --> 02:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:38.580 --> 02:57:42.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:57:42.790 --> 02:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:54.849 --> 02:57:54.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:04.990 --> 02:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:08.769 --> 02:58:08.779 align:start position:0%
in the long run more money yeah yes
 
02:58:11.150 --> 02:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
well that's why we changed it to 80
 
02:58:11.160 --> 02:58:13.510 align:start position:0%
well that's why we changed it to 80
percent

02:58:13.510 --> 02:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:17.450 --> 02:58:17.460 align:start position:0%
but we were trying to get more projects
 
02:58:17.460 --> 02:58:18.889 align:start position:0%
but we were trying to get more projects
approved

02:58:18.889 --> 02:58:18.899 align:start position:0%
approved
 
02:58:21.290 --> 02:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
but that that works if you're sort of
 
02:58:23.990 --> 02:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
all time when you're not all cut up and
 
02:58:26.330 --> 02:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
you've got a backlog now you're going to
 
02:58:28.130 --> 02:58:28.140 align:start position:0%
put towns making a decision to go
 
02:58:30.050 --> 02:58:30.060 align:start position:0%
forward without any building because
 
02:58:31.730 --> 02:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
they can't wait anymore
 
02:58:34.910 --> 02:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
if you can only take so many projects or
 
02:58:36.550 --> 02:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
a year
 
02:58:39.230 --> 02:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
you now have a bunch of schools that are
 
02:58:41.269 --> 02:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
taking a look at not submitting building
 
02:58:43.910 --> 02:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
a because they're looking for ways to
 
02:58:46.790 --> 02:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
handle their diminished yeah
 
02:58:49.190 --> 02:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
yeah see if they can
 
02:58:54.170 --> 02:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
thread the needle and and Shrink their
 
02:58:57.889 --> 02:58:57.899 align:start position:0%
plant and materials before that to match
 
02:59:01.130 --> 02:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
there I mean there's a lot of things I
 
02:59:02.870 --> 02:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
mean talking to move forward with the
 
02:59:02.880 --> 02:59:03.950 align:start position:0%
mean talking to move forward with the
project

02:59:03.950 --> 02:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:59:07.010 --> 02:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
um uh three years ago because
 
02:59:08.990 --> 02:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
um interest rates or boundaries from
 
02:59:10.670 --> 02:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
solo we're like we're not gonna wait
 
02:59:13.550 --> 02:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I know you know that was a good
 
02:59:17.090 --> 02:59:17.100 align:start position:0%
that was a decision giving it now you're
 
02:59:19.070 --> 02:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
looking to see how many applications are
 
02:59:22.690 --> 02:59:22.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:25.550 --> 02:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
02:59:27.710 --> 02:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
well see this is all discussion we had
 
02:59:30.290 --> 02:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
and this this is just cleaning up this
 
02:59:33.170 --> 02:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
particular process we have
 
02:59:34.910 --> 02:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
we know we're going to have to do a lot
 
02:59:41.389 --> 02:59:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:41.399 --> 02:59:42.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:59:42.830 --> 02:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:59:44.389 --> 02:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
something well I think if it was a
 
02:59:47.450 --> 02:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
transition plan we we put
 
02:59:51.410 --> 02:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
we'd have a a 20-year payment um uh on
 
02:59:54.110 --> 02:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
it and then transit to to get kind of
 
02:59:55.730 --> 02:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
get out of it no no but I'm sorry but
 
02:59:59.389 --> 02:59:59.399 align:start position:0%
but to get back to more of a normal uh
 
03:00:01.670 --> 03:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
post moratorium
 
03:00:04.070 --> 03:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
um thing where we where we only get
 
03:00:06.110 --> 03:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
you know four or five applications a
 
03:00:07.730 --> 03:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
year or something like that that we can
 
03:00:10.130 --> 03:00:10.140 align:start position:0%
take care of but right now we've got way
 
03:00:12.530 --> 03:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
too high but we don't know beyond this
 
03:00:15.110 --> 03:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
curtain this transition
 
03:00:20.410 --> 03:00:20.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:23.630 --> 03:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
so what do you mean well it may be uh
 
03:00:26.809 --> 03:00:26.819 align:start position:0%
funding or going there's a lot of
 
03:00:28.250 --> 03:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
different scenarios roaming around the
 
03:00:29.590 --> 03:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
halls right now
 
03:00:36.550 --> 03:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:39.590 --> 03:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
yeah there's some of that going on but
 
03:00:41.929 --> 03:00:41.939 align:start position:0%
until all that stuff happens we gotta
 
03:00:43.849 --> 03:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
clean up what we're doing well this is
 
03:00:45.830 --> 03:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying and that's what that
 
03:00:47.570 --> 03:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
um and you're going with the idea well
 
03:00:49.969 --> 03:00:49.979 align:start position:0%
we'll only find X number up front and
 
03:00:51.290 --> 03:00:51.300 align:start position:0%
we'll take the remaining money and
 
03:00:52.490 --> 03:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
probably get a few more projects
 
03:00:52.500 --> 03:00:58.150 align:start position:0%
probably get a few more projects
involved

03:00:58.150 --> 03:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:02.210 --> 03:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
you you still you still take on that
 
03:01:06.410 --> 03:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
that 38 chunk or whatever the um the the
 
03:01:08.750 --> 03:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
district is qualified for but it's paid
 
03:01:12.110 --> 03:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
out rather than you know 80 20 in that
 
03:01:14.450 --> 03:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
first year it's paid out over that's
 
03:01:16.490 --> 03:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about over the period
 
03:01:18.469 --> 03:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
of bond yes lifetime of the bond exactly
 
03:01:21.469 --> 03:01:21.479 align:start position:0%
so you just apply it to your um which is
 
03:01:25.130 --> 03:01:25.140 align:start position:0%
extending the chart that Amy is
 
03:01:27.769 --> 03:01:27.779 align:start position:0%
which is basically our tail yeah you
 
03:01:29.929 --> 03:01:29.939 align:start position:0%
know you're extending that yeah yes
 
03:01:32.929 --> 03:01:32.939 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely but I'm saying
 
03:01:35.690 --> 03:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
that there may be a different
 
03:01:38.450 --> 03:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
we may be living with that tail when we
 
03:01:41.269 --> 03:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
when we're in a completely different
 
03:01:47.290 --> 03:01:47.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:51.590 --> 03:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
we still would have this fail but you
 
03:01:53.389 --> 03:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
gotta recognize in the next three or
 
03:01:54.889 --> 03:01:54.899 align:start position:0%
four years that tail is going to
 
03:01:56.809 --> 03:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
significantly drop right
 
03:01:58.790 --> 03:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
and once that drops there will be more
 
03:02:01.010 --> 03:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
money available which we're doing this
 
03:02:04.790 --> 03:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:07.309 --> 03:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
well what I'm saying is that tail is
 
03:02:08.990 --> 03:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
just going to take us and then we have
 
03:02:11.750 --> 03:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
that level
 
03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:35.560 align:start position:0%
that level
foreign

03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:35.570 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:35.570 --> 03:02:38.530 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:02:38.530 --> 03:02:38.540 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:02:41.230 --> 03:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
so we take that out
 
03:02:45.010 --> 03:02:45.020 align:start position:0%
and this is just the front side you know
 
03:02:47.090 --> 03:02:47.100 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from Dave right
 
03:02:49.790 --> 03:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
there whether maybe we only of the
 
03:02:52.370 --> 03:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
portion that's owed to that town instead
 
03:02:55.790 --> 03:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
of 80 maybe it's a lesser amount that I
 
03:02:57.110 --> 03:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
think is something it needs a little bit
 
03:02:58.250 --> 03:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
more discussion and probably wouldn't
 
03:03:00.170 --> 03:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
need to get amended into the senate or
 
03:03:03.710 --> 03:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
later I think that in that so for all
 
03:03:05.510 --> 03:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
policies I think we're you're putting
 
03:03:07.849 --> 03:03:07.859 align:start position:0%
together a good good policy changes in
 
03:03:09.950 --> 03:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
this and then maybe if we want to
 
03:03:12.710 --> 03:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
consider payment schedule changes Senate
 
03:03:14.389 --> 03:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
would be the place there also needs to
 
03:03:18.110 --> 03:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
be a wider look at the whole process of
 
03:03:20.090 --> 03:03:20.100 align:start position:0%
what that is and we've we talked about
 
03:03:22.070 --> 03:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
how to do that and I think we can do it
 
03:03:24.710 --> 03:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
through just a working group yeah we
 
03:03:26.210 --> 03:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
don't have to have any formalized
 
03:03:28.070 --> 03:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
another commission or a committee we can
 
03:03:29.750 --> 03:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
just do a working group right here yeah
 
03:03:31.730 --> 03:03:31.740 align:start position:0%
and and get a lot of people and people
 
03:03:33.769 --> 03:03:33.779 align:start position:0%
come in with all ideas say come share
 
03:03:35.090 --> 03:03:35.100 align:start position:0%
your ideas
 
03:03:38.630 --> 03:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
have a bill to do that with as a
 
03:03:41.530 --> 03:03:41.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:44.750 --> 03:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
we don't we can we can set up a work
 
03:03:46.849 --> 03:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
group on anything we want
 
03:03:48.769 --> 03:03:48.779 align:start position:0%
and that's another way of doing it
 
03:03:50.510 --> 03:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
rather it's the same thing as a
 
03:03:52.610 --> 03:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
committee basically yeah just talking
 
03:03:54.410 --> 03:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
about talking about ideas yeah that's
 
03:03:56.630 --> 03:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah um but that's the way to
 
03:03:58.429 --> 03:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
do it but while we're on ideas right now
 
03:04:02.630 --> 03:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
the one payment works because it's the
 
03:04:05.030 --> 03:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
the payment you get from building Aid
 
03:04:07.849 --> 03:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
goes right right towards the towards the
 
03:04:11.290 --> 03:04:11.300 align:start position:0%
project and then you Bond the remainder
 
03:04:14.210 --> 03:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
and then you get your your 20 years of
 
03:04:17.750 --> 03:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
debt service on the uh on the bond the
 
03:04:21.830 --> 03:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
um a 20-year payment works because the
 
03:04:24.469 --> 03:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
first payment you get is is tied in with
 
03:04:26.090 --> 03:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
the first year that you have the bond
 
03:04:29.210 --> 03:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
payment yeah and you you know you use
 
03:04:31.429 --> 03:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
that to help out with your your debt
 
03:04:31.439 --> 03:04:32.150 align:start position:0%
that to help out with your your debt
service

03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:04:35.750 --> 03:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
five-year schedule doesn't it because
 
03:04:37.910 --> 03:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
now you're going to bounce the tax rate
 
03:04:40.150 --> 03:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to be you're gonna yeah
 
03:04:43.670 --> 03:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
hitting well that's true yes and your
 
03:04:46.610 --> 03:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
tax returns that's there right or you're
 
03:04:48.170 --> 03:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
saying that's just the local issue huh
 
03:04:52.610 --> 03:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
no no but but it is funny work but
 
03:04:54.889 --> 03:04:54.899 align:start position:0%
numbers in between don't work well if we
 
03:04:58.010 --> 03:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
go to this if we go to this smaller not
 
03:05:00.710 --> 03:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
80 up front we have to recognize that
 
03:05:04.070 --> 03:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
we're hurting the towns right
 
03:05:08.750 --> 03:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:08.760 --> 03:05:09.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:05:09.410 --> 03:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
well you played well no I mean good good
 
03:05:17.269 --> 03:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
value challenges too but but you're also
 
03:05:20.750 --> 03:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
hurting the towns that that then have to
 
03:05:22.910 --> 03:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
move forward with a building uh Project
 
03:05:24.590 --> 03:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
without any
 
03:05:28.490 --> 03:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
um building uh because they they were
 
03:05:31.429 --> 03:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
they were ranked seven or eight there is
 
03:05:34.010 --> 03:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
a downside to it even though if you
 
03:05:36.410 --> 03:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
think you've been doing more projects
 
03:05:39.050 --> 03:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
you're still hurting well because
 
03:05:41.750 --> 03:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
because they'll be paying that's three
 
03:05:44.809 --> 03:05:44.819 align:start position:0%
and a half percent on the 38 percent or
 
03:05:47.150 --> 03:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
those so 60 says it would have gotten
 
03:05:50.330 --> 03:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
from the plant state so what we need to
 
03:05:52.730 --> 03:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
do is that we we need that substance
 
03:05:55.370 --> 03:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
working group
 
03:05:58.550 --> 03:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right so we will do that uh
 
03:06:00.590 --> 03:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
but I'm Gonna Get You know some of this
 
03:06:03.290 --> 03:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
going with OLS I think that makes sense
 
03:06:06.290 --> 03:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
though so we can just you know get the
 
03:06:07.969 --> 03:06:07.979 align:start position:0%
timeline squared away I think the
 
03:06:11.990 --> 03:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:14.330 --> 03:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
either double
 
03:06:14.340 --> 03:06:19.250 align:start position:0%
either double
or

03:06:19.250 --> 03:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:22.250 --> 03:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
which I gotta work I can't even
 
03:06:25.730 --> 03:06:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:25.740 --> 03:06:27.170 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:06:27.170 --> 03:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:06:33.830 --> 03:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:36.349 --> 03:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
almost but what we need to do we need
 
03:06:38.950 --> 03:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
that time to review these projects
 
03:06:42.050 --> 03:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind it would be great if
 
03:06:44.150 --> 03:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
there was a way of nourishing one year
 
03:06:47.290 --> 03:06:47.300 align:start position:0%
of the biennium
 
03:06:50.330 --> 03:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
Amy and school building authority was
 
03:06:53.929 --> 03:06:53.939 align:start position:0%
able to utilize that time to visit prod
 
03:06:56.690 --> 03:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
visit schools
 
03:06:59.570 --> 03:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
and the second year we just do this
 
03:06:59.580 --> 03:07:00.469 align:start position:0%
and the second year we just do this
little

03:07:00.469 --> 03:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
little
 
03:07:04.130 --> 03:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
pro forma here's our story
 
03:07:07.429 --> 03:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
because right now we're jamming all of
 
03:07:10.130 --> 03:07:10.140 align:start position:0%
those visits on both sides
 
03:07:15.349 --> 03:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:18.110 --> 03:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
October 15th and November 15th
 
03:07:22.190 --> 03:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
basically the treasurer the State Fire
 
03:07:24.170 --> 03:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
Marshal me
 
03:07:27.349 --> 03:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
um and two other people that worked
 
03:07:27.359 --> 03:07:29.510 align:start position:0%
um and two other people that worked
full-time

03:07:29.510 --> 03:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
03:07:31.309 --> 03:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
not easy
 
03:07:34.070 --> 03:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
well one always be 17 projects every
 
03:07:37.090 --> 03:07:37.100 align:start position:0%
year it'll be well for a while
 
03:07:39.710 --> 03:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
yeah but it will and there's a
 
03:07:41.210 --> 03:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
difference between new construction and
 
03:07:43.309 --> 03:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
renovation we only pick off a few at the
 
03:07:46.090 --> 03:07:46.100 align:start position:0%
topic maybe 17.
 
03:07:49.010 --> 03:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
Dave maybe you have two parts yeah new
 
03:07:51.290 --> 03:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
construction and renovation yep he's
 
03:07:53.690 --> 03:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
telling you maybe one you apply to one
 
03:07:55.309 --> 03:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
program well we talked about renovation
 
03:07:57.410 --> 03:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
maybe just dealing with a safety issue
 
03:07:59.630 --> 03:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
yeah whereas the new construction's
 
03:08:02.450 --> 03:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
dealing with all those criteria so new
 
03:08:04.670 --> 03:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
renovation Renovations not going to get
 
03:08:05.929 --> 03:08:05.939 align:start position:0%
any points because they don't have all
 
03:08:07.250 --> 03:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
those points well maybe another
 
03:08:10.250 --> 03:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
possibility too Rick would be two two
 
03:08:12.110 --> 03:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
application ones
 
03:08:14.630 --> 03:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
um where where where it gets paid all
 
03:08:28.510 --> 03:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:32.269 --> 03:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
a public school infrastructure to handle
 
03:08:35.030 --> 03:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
Renovations and we have school building
 
03:08:37.490 --> 03:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
Aid handle new project
 
03:08:40.389 --> 03:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
that's another item yeah see yeah
 
03:08:42.469 --> 03:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
continuing conversation but if you've
 
03:08:44.690 --> 03:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
got if you've got a one payment program
 
03:08:47.889 --> 03:08:47.899 align:start position:0%
and a 20 payment program representative
 
03:08:51.610 --> 03:08:51.620 align:start position:0%
might be better in the 20.
 
03:08:51.620 --> 03:08:53.769 align:start position:0%
might be better in the 20.
yeah

03:08:53.769 --> 03:08:53.779 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:08:56.150 --> 03:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
put that in this thing
 
03:09:04.090 --> 03:09:04.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:06.769 --> 03:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
I've not ever thought about it did you
 
03:09:08.389 --> 03:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
get that to me right now
 
03:09:08.399 --> 03:09:15.530 align:start position:0%
get that to me right now
okay

03:09:15.530 --> 03:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:15.540 --> 03:09:32.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:09:32.530 --> 03:09:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:35.870 --> 03:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Amy
 
03:09:38.750 --> 03:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
yeah chew on that one so where's this
 
03:09:41.889 --> 03:09:41.899 align:start position:0%
next meeting meet I was going to ask you
 
03:09:44.170 --> 03:09:44.180 align:start position:0%
well it's a senate
 
03:09:46.010 --> 03:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
it's got to be across the street
 
03:09:46.020 --> 03:09:47.769 align:start position:0%
it's got to be across the street
somewhere

03:09:47.769 --> 03:09:47.779 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
03:09:49.910 --> 03:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go get my lunch in this
 
03:09:53.110 --> 03:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
front seat of my car I'm not coming up
 
03:09:56.769 --> 03:09:56.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:00.590 --> 03:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:02.690 --> 03:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
I teach a shortage
 
03:10:02.700 --> 03:10:22.450 align:start position:0%
I teach a shortage
exactly

03:10:22.450 --> 03:10:22.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:30.610 --> 03:10:30.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:32.750 --> 03:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
another reason
 
03:10:32.760 --> 03:10:36.590 align:start position:0%
another reason
so

03:10:36.590 --> 03:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:36.600 --> 03:10:56.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:10:56.269 --> 03:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:04.010 --> 03:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:20.410 --> 03:11:20.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:27.710 --> 03:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:27.720 --> 03:11:34.490 align:start position:0%
 
no problems

03:11:34.490 --> 03:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:34.500 --> 03:11:37.969 align:start position:0%
 
here

03:11:37.969 --> 03:11:37.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:37.979 --> 03:12:02.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:12:02.590 --> 03:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:05.150 --> 03:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:12:24.309 --> 03:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:27.429 --> 03:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
there's there's
 
03:12:30.410 --> 03:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
you know like we're we're obviously a
 
03:12:33.349 --> 03:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
pat Casey family for ACLS and stuff like
 
03:12:35.450 --> 03:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
that but there are other good documents
 
03:12:37.550 --> 03:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
too and don't don't get something done
 
03:12:39.110 --> 03:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
before you need to get it done because
 
03:12:42.889 --> 03:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
sometimes it means now yeah yeah you may
 
03:12:44.690 --> 03:12:44.700 align:start position:0%
be good you know
 
03:12:46.370 --> 03:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
whatever they put in it's never going to
 
03:12:49.250 --> 03:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
be as good as the original equipment
 
03:12:53.870 --> 03:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:58.969 --> 03:12:58.979 align:start position:0%
so I think a chance to sleep in this
 
03:13:01.370 --> 03:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
morning no that's
 
03:13:16.490 --> 03:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:18.469 --> 03:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
03:13:21.830 --> 03:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
um so this is a building Aid idea and
 
03:13:23.389 --> 03:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sharing it with you because I've
 
03:13:25.610 --> 03:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
sent you a text but I don't know if you
 
03:13:27.230 --> 03:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
get it because I don't know as if I
 
03:13:28.490 --> 03:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
actually have your cell phone number and
 
03:13:31.929 --> 03:13:31.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:34.309 --> 03:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
right and that's why I actually just
 
03:13:36.010 --> 03:13:36.020 align:start position:0%
wanted it was this morning
 
03:13:38.330 --> 03:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
this morning yeah it was like I'll be
 
03:13:40.429 --> 03:13:40.439 align:start position:0%
there at nine and I only ask because I
 
03:13:42.950 --> 03:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if I actually have your
 
03:13:45.889 --> 03:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:47.450 --> 03:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
um but don't really worry about it if
 
03:13:50.090 --> 03:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
not okay I'm just looking at this
 
03:13:51.469 --> 03:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
morning no it's to you and
 
03:13:53.510 --> 03:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative black so the point is
 
03:13:55.730 --> 03:13:55.740 align:start position:0%
that I went over this weekend this
 
03:13:58.130 --> 03:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
morning so he is aware of my just
 
03:14:00.469 --> 03:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
brainstorming again
 
03:14:00.479 --> 03:14:01.250 align:start position:0%
brainstorming again
um

03:14:01.250 --> 03:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:03.950 --> 03:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
so the way we see it works for building
 
03:14:07.550 --> 03:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
it is we find a proration amount
 
03:14:09.730 --> 03:14:09.740 align:start position:0%
um of everybody
 
03:14:13.429 --> 03:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
so I'm just curious if that model and
