00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
not seeing any of the people who are
 
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.710 align:start position:0%

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if that's the people
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
testifying not having their camera on or
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's something in our system but
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
if we could it would be nice to see who
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
is testifying
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%

see them
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
so that i will
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
request that they turn their camera on
 
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.870 align:start position:0%
request that they turn their camera on
okay

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%

i just wanted to um just on a technical
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
basis people have to come in as um
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%

people are reading the rules different
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
as i see it
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%

some of our repairs they range from
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
three to four thousand dollars on a real
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
this has been
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
this is like
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
trying to keep two balls alive
 
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's been another one's been challenging
 
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
but this
 
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
this committee though it's not heavy
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
usually we have some bills
 
00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.109 align:start position:0%
usually we have some bills
sensitivity

00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
sensitivity
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely the
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
people you know assets we've had testing
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%

00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
anybody you know we
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
can you hear this mic now
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
yeah this one was good
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
testing can you hear me testing
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
that was brad looks like everybody else
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
is muted
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
representative post uh
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:24.559 --> 01:00:25.510 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
is there any i realize this is a public
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
meeting and
 
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
probably the reason we do not have a
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
chat function is because the public
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
can't see it
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
but is there any way that
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
we can pose questions
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
or things like that when we're having
 
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.230 align:start position:0%
or things like that when we're having
trouble

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.109 align:start position:0%
trouble
um

01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
unmuting and things like that that we
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
can put
 
01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.430 align:start position:0%
can put
somewhere

01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
for someone to look at
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
representative post i suggest just um

we're having trouble hearing
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
or if you can't mute contact i think i
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
an issue um i can step in if
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
extra assistance is needed

i made its way through the house and
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%

uh down on line 28 29 and 30. you'll see
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
there's a section
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
any person installing an active seasonal
 
01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
platform should demonstrate to the
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
satisfaction of the director
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
that the placement of such seasonal
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
platform does not obstruct any shore
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
front properties view of the body of
 
01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
water in which the ancient system
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
platform is to be installed
 
01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
that was removed from 1609 by your
 
01:09:17.199 --> 01:09:18.309 align:start position:0%
that was removed from 1609 by your
committee

01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
last year and i i agree that that's that
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
should be removed
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
i believe the marine mutual does also
 
01:09:24.239 --> 01:09:25.749 align:start position:0%

2020
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i compared it to house built round
 
01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.270 align:start position:0%
and i compared it to house built round
nine

01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
nine
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
which is before us now to see if there
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
is any
 
01:11:05.679 --> 01:11:07.590 align:start position:0%
is any
differences

01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
differences
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
and i did find some
 
01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.189 align:start position:0%
and i did find some
minor

01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
minor
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
what i consider minor differences
 
01:11:13.679 --> 01:11:15.030 align:start position:0%
what i consider minor differences
uh

01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:15.990 align:start position:0%
uh
the

01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
differences that i found or was able to
 
01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.630 align:start position:0%
differences that i found or was able to
find

01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
find
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
comparing 99 to 1609
 
01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:24.830 align:start position:0%
comparing 99 to 1609
was

01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.470 align:start position:0%
was

01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%

01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
two additions one uh

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.850 align:start position:0%

which is any person installing an

demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
director but the placement of such
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
anchored seasonal platforms does not
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
obstruct any
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%

01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%

01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
but as well as
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh now remember
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
it was not in
 
01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:33.990 align:start position:0%

it reads
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
in such a manner that obstructs any

chairman or
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh there seems to be a problem

anybody else had a problem or not but i

barely got any of your message and
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
evidently other people are raising their

hand also
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
need to back away from the mic back away
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
from the mic a little bit it's totally
 
01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.110 align:start position:0%
from the mic a little bit it's totally
distorted

1609 which the committee had passed

last year
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
20 to nothing
 
01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
there i
 
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
took the liberty to go through
 
01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.310 align:start position:0%
took the liberty to go through
1609

01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
1609
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
with the previous year's bill with uh
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
90 house bill 99 and there are some
 
01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.709 align:start position:0%
90 house bill 99 and there are some
differences

01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
differences
 
01:22:30.719 --> 01:22:32.629 align:start position:0%
differences
the

01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh one the first difference is item
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh roman numeral three
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
and it says
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
any person installing an anchored
 
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
seasonal platform shall demonstrate to
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
the satisfaction of the director
 
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
that the placement of such anchored
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
seasonal platforms does not obstruct any
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
shoreline shorefront property view of
 
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
the body of water in which the anchored
 
01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
seasonal platform is to be installed
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's was one apparent addition
 
01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.990 align:start position:0%
that's was one apparent addition
and

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
from

01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
to house bill 99
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
that differs from what is house bill
 
01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
1609 the other addition
 
01:23:26.239 --> 01:23:27.590 align:start position:0%
1609 the other addition
is

01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
there is a about a two inches lower than
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
that on the again on the second page
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
item e
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
small and small letter e
 
01:23:39.679 --> 01:23:40.470 align:start position:0%
small and small letter e
and

01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it goes in reads in
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
conjunction which with item d which
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
actually is uh
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
in both bills item e's uh small letter e
 
01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:51.669 align:start position:0%
in both bills item e's uh small letter e
says

01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
in such a manner that obstructs another
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
property owner's view of the body of
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
water in which it is located
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
okay so those are the additions to i uh
 
01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.189 align:start position:0%
okay so those are the additions to i uh
to

01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
to

difference
 
01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.830 align:start position:0%
difference
was

01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
was

01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
the that the that part of that
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
is missing
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
it just says the enforcement just speaks
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
in sixteen that is missing ins uh uh in
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 99
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh and it's
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh a it just ends in
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
penalties but not exemptions
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
those are the uh
 
01:25:04.639 --> 01:25:06.229 align:start position:0%
those are the uh
items

01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
items
 
01:25:06.239 --> 01:25:07.830 align:start position:0%
items
uh

01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
the i asked
 
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
to address that
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
it is not something that
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not certain this needs
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
if we are agreeing with what is in
 
01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.510 align:start position:0%
if we are agreeing with what is in
idaho

01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
idaho
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
doubts bill 9.
 
01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:28.870 align:start position:0%
doubts bill 9.
so

01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
but just be aware that those are the
 
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
slight those are the differences
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
that be between the bill and we can talk
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
about this if we when we go to exec or
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
there might be some
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh testimony that says
 
01:25:44.239 --> 01:25:45.750 align:start position:0%
uh testimony that says
why

01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
the why that discrepancy
 
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
or difference exists and we'll convince
 
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:52.830 align:start position:0%

01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
financial component to this
 
01:29:57.679 --> 01:29:59.910 align:start position:0%

fiscal note on to this uh legislation

it'll stay that way without any fiscal
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
note so i don't think there'll be any
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact upon the state or our
 
01:30:16.239 --> 01:30:17.830 align:start position:0%

01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
waterways we have a boat
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
um there are lots of them um i don't
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
know how often they come loose or the
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
problems that they have but i would
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
assume this would take more time
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
of our um
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
the people who monitor our waterways um
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
and wondered if that would um have a
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
financial effect
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
um in now adding these to
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
um because there are so many
 
01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.310 align:start position:0%
um because there are so many
um

01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
to their responsibilities
 
01:31:00.719 --> 01:31:01.510 align:start position:0%
to their responsibilities
uh

01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
i will
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
i can uh
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
i don't think uh
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
i think the the following speaker may be
 
01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:10.719 align:start position:0%
able to answer that question yeah i was
 
01:31:12.149 --> 01:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
just gonna say i think the um the next
 
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
person to testify who i believe is from
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
marine patrol they'll be better um
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
suited to answer your question but i
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
think it's a good question worthy of
 
01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:20.709 align:start position:0%
think it's a good question worthy of
asking

01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
asking
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you

uh and respectfully ask that you
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%

the chair as well as representative
mcdonald

01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
mcdonald
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
the history behind this bill uh goes
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
back uh a few years as you've heard
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
and it it addresses what currently
 
01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:26.070 align:start position:0%
and it it addresses what currently
exists

01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
exists
 
01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:26.870 align:start position:0%
exists
as

01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
what some would consider a problem on
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
our public waters as it relates to
 
01:32:30.239 --> 01:32:31.350 align:start position:0%
our public waters as it relates to
inflatable

01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
inflatable
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
devices particularly
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
trampolines icebergs climbing walls and
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
the like
 
01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.470 align:start position:0%
the like
um

01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
the proliferation of these uh somewhat
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
affordable somewhat not affordable
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
depending upon your budget
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh items
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh has has
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
has raised concerns where they are
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
unregulated at this point
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
absent them being placed as a hazard to
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
navigation or
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
impeding navigation of boats
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
anyone who has legal access to the water
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
can install these in front of anyone
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
else's property and there's nothing we
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
can do about it unless they are blocking
 
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
someone's access to their own dock
 
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
so this bill would allow the marine
 
01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:16.629 align:start position:0%
so this bill would allow the marine
patrol

01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
patrol
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
to enforce the installation of these
 
01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:21.750 align:start position:0%
to enforce the installation of these
devices

01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
devices
 
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
and and regulate their placement
 
01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:25.510 align:start position:0%
and and regulate their placement
um

01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
certainly the language in house bill 99
 
01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
that that has been discussed earlier
 
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
about striking the language it refers to
 
01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
impeding one's view
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
marine patrol would enforce the striking
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
of that language as it would be very
 
01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:38.950 align:start position:0%
of that language as it would be very
difficult

01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh without further clarification to
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
enforce simply saying obstructing a view
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
certainly means just about any neighbor
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
could complain about the placement of
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
inflatable whether it's in front of
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
their property or not
 
01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:52.709 align:start position:0%
their property or not
uh

01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
the the second change that has been
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
discussed regarding uh identifying
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
exceptions to this statute
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh was initially brought forth by dot uh
 
01:34:05.669 --> 01:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh last year last session
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
and marine patrol agreed with with their
 
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
point where there are times when
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
bridge contractors subcontractors are
 
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
installing floats that would meet this
 
01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.189 align:start position:0%
installing floats that would meet this
definition

01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
to do bridge work so it would be an
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence um and burden on
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions to to seek
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
um permission for installment so we
 
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
expanded the exceptions to also include
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
those who might be involved in water
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
quality studies that use floats uh
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
certainly the placement of floating
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
nests for our loons
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh and so
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
those items have been captured in that
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
exception which i again would encourage
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
you to consider
 
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.510 align:start position:0%
you to consider
um

01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
to to go in and address representative
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
post question about the financial
 
01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.350 align:start position:0%
post question about the financial
impacts

01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
this this statute or this language this
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
bill would require people to to put
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
their name on these floating devices and
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
a contact phone number
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
right now marine patrol spends more time
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
trying to track down the owner and if
 
01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
they don't come to claim their property
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
marine patrol has to engage in the
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
process of bringing these devices uh to
 
01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
storage facilities and then on to
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
the state surplus white farm uh where
 
01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
they would go to state auction
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
so it certainly uh is in everybody's
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
financial interest to be able to return
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
them to the rightful owner and and ease
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
our burden of having to go through that
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
auction process by simply being able to
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
make a phone call and allow a person to
 
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
claim what is rightly theirs
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm happy to answer any
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
other questions but but marine patrol is
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
in support of
 
01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
of the of the language uh particularly
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
as it appeared in
 
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
any questions members of the committee
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:03.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
president posed his first representative
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
post you have a question the captain
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um i would like to know
 
01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.830 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um i would like to know
how

01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
people would
 
01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.390 align:start position:0%
people would
apply

01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
apply
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
for a permit
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
to do this um what would be the
 
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.709 align:start position:0%
to do this um what would be the
mechanism

01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question this
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
language does not require a permit it
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
simply allows the enforcement of of what
 
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
is in in the language before you
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh should a person install it uh in a
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
manner that is not in front of their own
 
01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:38.950 align:start position:0%
manner that is not in front of their own
property

01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps extends beyond
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh the the dimensions of their
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
shorefront property
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh or is is placed where it impacts
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
navigation or the recreational uses of a
 
01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:50.790 align:start position:0%
navigation or the recreational uses of a
neighbor

01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
neighbor
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
so it's not restricting the uh surefront
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
property owner's ability to install it
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
it just allows uh
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
some control as to the placement and how
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
it impacts
 
01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh captain dunlevy for
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
um i noticed that this proposed bill
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
talks about anchored
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
seasonal platforms and maybe you can
 
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
refresh my memory from last year
 
01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:28.709 align:start position:0%
refresh my memory from last year
um

01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
i remember the size and the pictures of
 
01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
all these floats
 
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
do we have any regulation what if it's
 
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
not anchored and it's as big as a house
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
can they just put it on the waterways or
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
is there another provision somewhere
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
because i read this bill only to call
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
for anchored platform thank you
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
certainly uh there are
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
a few and i would say it would be a very
 
01:37:59.590 --> 01:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
few uh people who may launch a boat for
 
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
a day trip and bring one of these
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
devices along with them
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh it takes some significant planning
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
and work because they have to inflate
 
01:38:08.239 --> 01:38:09.109 align:start position:0%
and work because they have to inflate
them

01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh either at the ramp or and tow them
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
out or or inflate them out on the water
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
we have not seen any devices that are
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
used that aren't anchored in any way uh
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
when when they would be afloat it would
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
be a very temporary situation
 
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh and and they would fall under the
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
same regulations of any other floating
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
device that somebody may look to put out
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
on the water uh and and essentially it
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
would be a a navigation issue at that
 
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
point and and we we already have the
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
ability to statute to address any safety
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
concerns with that scenario
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you you answered my question thank
 
01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:51.109 align:start position:0%
thank you you answered my question thank
you

01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh ever have a question on
 
01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.030 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh ever have a question on
captain

01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
captain
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
representative post still has her hands
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
up oh no she hasn't fallen out you have
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
a follow-on representative post
 
01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:05.679 align:start position:0%
yes i do um so normally i believe that
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh boats and docks that you're mooring
 
01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
putting on an anchor
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
have to be approved um is would that be
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
the same with um these
 
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
floats that are
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
we're discussing
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
no ma'am it would not some of the
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
language that you find in the mooring
 
01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.350 align:start position:0%
language that you find in the mooring
law

01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
which by the way only applies to about
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
seven of our lakes
 
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
has been borrowed as far as
 
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
who is eligible to install these
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
but beyond that there is no permit
 
01:39:37.119 --> 01:39:39.510 align:start position:0%
but beyond that there is no permit
requirement

01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
no permission that needs to be sought
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
this language simply allows us to
 
01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:44.629 align:start position:0%
this language simply allows us to
enforce

01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh those things that might be installed
 
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
and misplaced or impact like i say the
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
the the users
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
that answer your question
 
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative creighton
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh captain the uh
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
i heard you say it but it was muffled so
 
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
i guess what was your
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
your take on the obstruction comment
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh currently thank you representative
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
currently there are statutes already on
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
the books that allow us to address
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
any placement of these devices either
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
floating or anchored which are impacting
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
i would only recommend striking the
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
the line that that was discussed earlier
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
as it pertains to obstructing a view
 
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
and then including the exceptions that
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
were discussed
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much sir thank you
 
01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:04.550 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much sir thank you
sir

01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
is there any other questions of the
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
present more answer oh representative
 
01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:11.830 align:start position:0%
present more answer oh representative
moran

01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
moran
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
are you there yes yes uh uh if this um
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
passes what would be the fines or fees
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
a captain
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh yes it would be considered a
 
01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:29.350 align:start position:0%
uh yes it would be considered a
violation

01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
violation
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
uh right now there is no uh monetary
 
01:41:32.719 --> 01:41:33.830 align:start position:0%
uh right now there is no uh monetary
amount

01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh placed on
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
the fine so that would be set by the
 
01:41:37.679 --> 01:41:38.629 align:start position:0%
the fine so that would be set by the
court

01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
typically uh non-safety related uh fines
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
that are assessed by it by the court
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
where there isn't a fine schedule in
 
01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:46.709 align:start position:0%
where there isn't a fine schedule in
place

01:41:46.709 --> 01:41:46.719 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up question on if a fine is
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
levied where do those funds go to
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh the general fund uh is my
 
01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:04.870 align:start position:0%
uh the general fund uh is my
understanding

01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:06.149 --> 01:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh there being no um more questions uh
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you captain
 
01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:18.790 align:start position:0%
thank you captain
uh

01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else nobody's scheduled
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
to speak there's nobody else scheduled
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and uh honorable

by yourself and uh who you represent
 
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
yes so my name is matt urban
 
01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
i represent the new hampshire department
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
of transportation i'm the chief of our
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
operations management section
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
i want to send a an extra thanks to
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald and also captain
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
ben levy i think they've done a great
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
job expressing
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
the concerns that d.o.t initially had
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
and we support the proposed amendment to
 
01:43:05.590 --> 01:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
carry over the language from 1609
 
01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
specific to the exemptions
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
section uh that said that that was our
 
01:43:13.109 --> 01:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
concern and i think it's been addressed
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
if that proposed amendment carries
 
01:43:14.719 --> 01:43:16.310 align:start position:0%
if that proposed amendment carries
through

01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%

i realized that um i have to leave now
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
of being stripped of my committee
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
assignment although i still remain on
 
01:44:59.830 --> 01:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
the role
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
and the roster
 
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
i feel very sad about this i feel that
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
there's been a double standard
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
i feel my freedom of speech is being
 
01:45:08.159 --> 01:45:10.229 align:start position:0%
i feel my freedom of speech is being
violated

01:45:10.229 --> 01:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
violated
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm just very disappointed
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
i feel like i've contributed well to
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
this committee and i'm ready to continue
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
i urged all my colleagues from across
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
the aisle as well to speak up because
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
today it's me tomorrow could be somebody
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
else but i i really feel like i've been
 
01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:28.070 align:start position:0%
else but i i really feel like i've been
mistreated

01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
mistreated
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%

exec this uh
 
01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:38.950 align:start position:0%

bill
 
01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%
today obviously that's not going to
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
happen it doesn't require a an amendment
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
so i'll just put it on a future
 
01:45:49.119 --> 01:45:51.030 align:start position:0%
so i'll just put it on a future

uh for
uh

01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
haven't heard back yet specifically on
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
but i have intentionally tried to get
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
the next the the next wednesdays until
 
01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:42.639 align:start position:0%
we use up everything is who's up
 
01:46:42.639 --> 01:46:43.669 align:start position:0%
we use up everything is who's up
everything

01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
and that would probably be an additional
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
three meetings
 
01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
so at least you can plan that far i hope
 
01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:51.590 align:start position:0%
so at least you can plan that far i hope
so

01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh let you all go uh until 10 we'll

uh let you all go uh until 10 we'll
reconvene

01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
did somebody say they were going to take
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
charge of putting together that number
 
01:47:04.229 --> 01:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh they will
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's the person who suggested is going
 
01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
to do it yep
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
oh well the person is going to do it
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:15.189 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald is the person
 
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
who's going to be responsible for the
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
amendment we may
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
wish to get involved
 
01:47:26.159 --> 01:47:27.109 align:start position:0%
wish to get involved
and

01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
we may have a uh
 
01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:30.870 align:start position:0%
we may have a uh
this

01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
could be a work session but lots make
 
01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
the choices on that i hadn't expected
 
01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:38.709 align:start position:0%
the choices on that i hadn't expected
this

01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:38.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
it's kind of good that i
 
01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
i did i i just was doing
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure i was just checking
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh the difference because we're trying
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
to say that these were
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
bills that were
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to have been
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
going uh that were passed
 
01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
last year well
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
being you know kind of retentive i just
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
decided to read
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
both of them together
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
and there were
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
my what i still call them real minor
 
01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:21.189 align:start position:0%
my what i still call them real minor
differences

01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
if we do this amendment
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
then the bill will be exactly the same
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
as passed the house on the consent
 
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
01:48:37.119 --> 01:48:38.070 align:start position:0%
looks like
yeah

01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
okay i mean yeah
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
that is that is true on the exemption
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
yeah the exemption was in the bill we
 
01:48:47.119 --> 01:48:48.149 align:start position:0%
yeah the exemption was in the bill we
passed

01:48:48.149 --> 01:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
he pretty much it looks like hb 99 is
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
the bill that was introduced last year
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
that we amended
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
and then we amended it and then it
 
01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:03.030 align:start position:0%
and then we amended it and then it
passed

01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
that's the one thing i didn't do was
 
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:05.440 align:start position:0%

the official notes of this meeting that
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
i disagree with the removal of
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative wrong that i believe is
 
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
not in the best interest of the citizens
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:45.990 --> 01:59:46.000 align:start position:0%

well
 
01:59:49.350 --> 01:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
they i don't believe that you can add
 
01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:50.390 align:start position:0%
they i don't believe that you can add
the

01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
mr chair you have kathleen murray from
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:14.719 --> 02:00:33.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:35.669 --> 02:00:35.679 align:start position:0%
house bill 184
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
call the
 
02:00:52.830 --> 02:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:55.990 --> 02:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
but morning um good morning to you all
 
02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
nice to see you all even if it's in this
 
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
strange situation hopefully in a
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
several months we'll be vaccinated and
 
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
we'll be back together but um good to
 
02:01:05.669 --> 02:01:05.679 align:start position:0%
see you all uh thank you for hearing
 
02:01:07.589 --> 02:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
this bill as many of you know this was a
 
02:01:10.149 --> 02:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
bill that was passed unanimously
 
02:01:12.870 --> 02:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
some about this time maybe last year
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
um you did field trips coming out here
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
which was great fun i think you do
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
terrific field trips hopefully you'll be
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
able to do those again
 
02:01:19.679 --> 02:01:21.030 align:start position:0%
able to do those again
um

02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
the bill basically is prohibiting
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
certain watercraft in marshlands in rye
 
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
and in the back channel in newcastle
 
02:01:30.070 --> 02:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
you took field trips out here so you
 
02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
have an idea of what that looks like
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
these watercraft leave pretty much
 
02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
lasting damage the damage that they do
 
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
to the ocean bed and the floor does not
 
02:01:41.589 --> 02:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
go away um with one tide or too tight or
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
three ties these marks tend to stay
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
there they're basically scars that will
 
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
last for years
 
02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
newcastle has worked very hard
 
02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:50.870 align:start position:0%
newcastle has worked very hard
to

02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
bolster its environment in terms of
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
protection um against
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
storm surges and climate change you know
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
we're an island we're about 50 percent
 
02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:02.070 align:start position:0%
we're an island we're about 50 percent
rock

02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
rock
 
02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
people have worked very hard to build up
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
the marshlands protect them bring them
 
02:02:08.550 --> 02:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
back to a good state of health and this
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
is one step to ensure that some of these
 
02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
marshlands these sponges that protect us
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
from flooding um are not damaged in the
 
02:02:17.109 --> 02:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
future um the same thing with rye i
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
think you received a wonderful letter
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
from representative groter um you've got
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
65 percent of wetland is in in rye and
 
02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
again uh these are
 
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
barriers and protections against climate
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
climate change storm surges
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
they're also used by
 
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
i guess benign
 
02:02:39.109 --> 02:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
recreational users for paddle boarding
 
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
for fishing kayaking canoeing and the
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
watercraft that we're talking about here
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
is very disruptive to the people who are
 
02:02:48.070 --> 02:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
trying to use those non-invasive types
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
of recreational activities in these
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
estuaries and in the back channel of
 
02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
newcastle so i'm happy to take any
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
questions i think most of you are quite
 
02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with this many of you are on
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
the field trip that we we did last year
 
02:03:03.990 --> 02:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
um i'm happy to take any questions um i
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
think there are some other people around
 
02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
here too that may be able to answer
 
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
questions better than i if they're
 
02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
become too technical
 
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
but i would respectfully ask that as you
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
did last year you passed this bill along
 
02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
to the senate so we can continue the
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
discussion there and hopefully maintain
 
02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
the protections that we've already put
 
02:03:22.229 --> 02:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
into place for rye and newcastle
 
02:03:24.070 --> 02:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
marshlands and waterways
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
so thank you i will take whatever
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
hello representative murray
 
02:03:33.119 --> 02:03:34.149 align:start position:0%
hello representative murray
yes

02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay we finally got through here
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i couldn't hear
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
oh yeah well we were trying to
 
02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
tell you that
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
we had very hard difficult time hearing
 
02:03:48.070 --> 02:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
you oh
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
well actually you're
 
02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
i think you're probably too close to the
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
mic and it was too fast and it was too
 
02:03:56.790 --> 02:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
fast but
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
because not really we
 
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:10.550 --> 02:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
should i recap major points uh yes why
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't why don't you
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
um newcastle is an island
 
02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
we've worked very hard to maintain
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
our marshlands to their maximum health
 
02:04:24.070 --> 02:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
and these types of watercraft do great
 
02:04:26.229 --> 02:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
damage to the
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
floor of the ocean
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
it impacts the ability of the marshland
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
to protect us against storm surge and
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
rising water
 
02:04:36.149 --> 02:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
this is one step in a larger
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
environmental program in rye and
 
02:04:42.070 --> 02:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
newcastle to protect our marshlands um
 
02:04:44.070 --> 02:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
against these sorts of issues
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
02:04:48.070 --> 02:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
is this better by the way
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
recreational users kayakers swimmers
 
02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.430 align:start position:0%
recreational users kayakers swimmers
paddleboard

02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
paddleboard
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
fishermen who use these channels and the
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
watercraft that's described in the bill
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
is very disruptive and dangerous we also
 
02:05:06.550 --> 02:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
have several swimming locations in these
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
areas and these
 
02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
these watercraft go by so quickly that
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
is quite a danger to the people who are
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
trying to use these in a non-invasive
 
02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
fashion so we're looking to protect the
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
people who use these in this
 
02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
non-invasive fashion and we're this bill
 
02:05:24.310 --> 02:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
as i said is um
 
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
an important step in protecting the
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
environment um for newcastle which is
 
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
subject to flooding since we are at
 
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
island we're about 50 percent rock and
 
02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
new castle where you have about 65
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
percent of the wetlands and again um
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
important areas that need to be
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
protected um against flooding
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
is that better
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:01.030 --> 02:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
just a quick question for you do you
 
02:06:02.790 --> 02:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
have the definition of personal
 
02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
watercraft that's being used for this
 
02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:06.709 align:start position:0%
watercraft that's being used for this
bill

02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's basically the jet ski
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's defined in the rsas before this
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
bill is based on a bill that was passed
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
two years ago i believe
 
02:06:22.229 --> 02:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
in hampton and seabrook
 
02:06:24.070 --> 02:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
the definition isn't included right here
 
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's included i think in the section
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
before this i don't have it with me i
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
can probably look it up quickly but it's
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
essentially it does not pertain to your
 
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
typical motor boats with a with a motor
 
02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's attached on the back
 
02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
um it's the jet ski that has that type
 
02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:43.669 align:start position:0%
um it's the jet ski that has that type
of

02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
motor where the water is pushed out from
 
02:06:48.629 --> 02:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
underneath and leaves deep channels in
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the the ocean floor of the
 
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
floor bed
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
great thank you so much
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
the personal water
 
02:06:58.229 --> 02:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
craft there i think there is a
 
02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
definition in the overall in the statute
 
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
that this is just
 
02:07:05.830 --> 02:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
the way the bill was written
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
you see only a small section
 
02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:09.910 align:start position:0%
you see only a small section
uh

02:07:09.910 --> 02:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:12.149 --> 02:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
anyone else any question by anyone else
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
there is
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative kelly
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative kelly you have a
 
02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:18.550 align:start position:0%
uh representative kelly you have a
question

02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair um i i have the rsa with
 
02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
the personal watercraft
 
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh definition in front of me if you'd
 
02:07:27.109 --> 02:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
like i can read it for the
 
02:07:27.119 --> 02:07:28.870 align:start position:0%
like i can read it for the
committee

02:07:28.870 --> 02:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:30.870 align:start position:0%

uh

02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful as long as it isn't
 
02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
big thing yeah it's quite short
 
02:07:39.910 --> 02:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft means a motorboat 16
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
feet or less in length that is propelled
 
02:07:44.149 --> 02:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
by jet pump not propellers where the
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
operator and riders stand kneel straddle
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
or sit on rather than inside the craft
 
02:07:50.079 --> 02:07:52.149 align:start position:0%
or sit on rather than inside the craft
okay

02:07:52.149 --> 02:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that that's helpful

honorable members of the committee
 
02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
marine patrol
 
02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
is aware of this legislation we support
 
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
it uh we are prepared uh in conjunction
 
02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
port authority to to post this area
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
this is a shallow area
 
02:09:20.229 --> 02:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
very susceptible to to tide fluctuation
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
and at times at low tide uh this is an
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
area that is one could consider high and
 
02:09:25.679 --> 02:09:26.629 align:start position:0%
area that is one could consider high and
dry

02:09:26.629 --> 02:09:26.639 align:start position:0%
dry
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
and at high tide it is very shallow
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh and in places it would only be these
 
02:09:34.550 --> 02:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
jet propelled type craft that even could
 
02:09:37.350 --> 02:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
operate uh in waters of this depth
 
02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh for those of you who may be generally
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
familiar with with portsmouth and
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
newcastle it's the back channel
 
02:09:46.149 --> 02:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
that runs from roughly wentworth by the
 
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
sea marina
 
02:09:50.229 --> 02:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh up through the back channels uh to uh
 
02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
pierce's island uh in in in that area
 
02:09:56.310 --> 02:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
jobs creek is another popular spot uh in
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
this area
 
02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
so it's not a huge impact to have global
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
waters for personal watercraft operators
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
and it is sensitive area that is being
 
02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:06.870 align:start position:0%
and it is sensitive area that is being
protected

02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
protected
 
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
02:10:10.390 --> 02:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
is there any questions

um just uh would like to ask a couple of
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
questions of representative murray and
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
of captain dunleavy
 
02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:26.320 align:start position:0%

watercraft and i live in the dover area
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
i'm also
 
02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
i own a couple of businesses that are
 
02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
involved in this and the sales and
 
02:11:35.350 --> 02:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
repair of watercraft on the seacoast
 
02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:36.709 align:start position:0%
repair of watercraft on the seacoast
area

02:11:36.709 --> 02:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
i understand thoroughly how these uh
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
these machines operate
 
02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:41.910 align:start position:0%
these machines operate
um

02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
having worked on them having been
 
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
involved in the in this industry for
 
02:11:48.629 --> 02:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
gosh 21 years now
 
02:11:50.310 --> 02:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
on the seacoast
 
02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:51.189 align:start position:0%
on the seacoast
and

02:11:51.189 --> 02:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh there's not a lot of members i just
 
02:11:55.830 --> 02:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
found out about this uh bill yesterday
 
02:11:58.390 --> 02:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
and uh you know we have as you can
 
02:12:00.709 --> 02:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
imagine we have dozens probably actually
 
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
at this point hundreds of customers
 
02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh in this area that own and operate uh
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft
 
02:12:10.629 --> 02:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
and um you know as much as
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
as a concern i have about this bill i'd
 
02:12:14.790 --> 02:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
like to look at this as an educational
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
experience uh for me because uh
 
02:12:20.069 --> 02:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
i'm unaware of anything that a
 
02:12:22.149 --> 02:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
watercraft can do
 
02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh to negatively affect the environment
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
that isn't already illegal
 
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
um i you know my understanding is is
 
02:12:30.550 --> 02:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
that uh representative murray made a
 
02:12:32.550 --> 02:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
statement about these these machines
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
passing very quickly
 
02:12:37.189 --> 02:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
as you may be aware rsa 270 already
 
02:12:37.199 --> 02:12:38.149 align:start position:0%
as you may be aware rsa 270 already
covers

02:12:38.149 --> 02:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
covers
 
02:12:38.159 --> 02:12:39.030 align:start position:0%
covers
yeah

02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:12:41.109 --> 02:12:41.119 align:start position:0%
whether boats have to operate boats
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
include watercraft have to operate at
 
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
headway speed within 150 feet
 
02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
of any shoreland uh areas so if there is
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
an area that is
 
02:12:53.270 --> 02:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
exposed as
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
due to low tide as the representative
 
02:12:56.950 --> 02:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
was talking about
 
02:12:58.709 --> 02:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh that area they would have to be
 
02:12:59.910 --> 02:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
operating at headway speed they could
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
not go through there quickly and that
 
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
would be you know kevin dunley please
 
02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but that would
 
02:13:04.719 --> 02:13:05.510 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but that would
be

02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
something that they could be cited for
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
um and banning uh you know an entire
 
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
user group of people
 
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh citizens in this area uh due to
 
02:13:18.069 --> 02:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:13:20.229 --> 02:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
due to issues that may or not be
 
02:13:20.239 --> 02:13:21.669 align:start position:0%
due to issues that may or not be
substantiated

02:13:21.669 --> 02:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
substantiated
 
02:13:24.149 --> 02:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh i have i have great concerns with and
 
02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering what
 
02:13:27.990 --> 02:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
evidence that we might have that
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
determines that has determined that the
 
02:13:33.189 --> 02:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
wave runners and watercraft are creating
 
02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
this damage they do operate with a jet
 
02:13:37.750 --> 02:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
pump they do not have propellers
 
02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
boats have you know propellers on them
 
02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
and the propellers are what creates the
 
02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
the majority of any damage to to the
 
02:13:48.709 --> 02:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
substrate uh in this in these areas and
 
02:13:51.030 --> 02:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
um i don't understand if there's been
 
02:13:52.629 --> 02:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
if there is real evidence out there that
 
02:13:54.550 --> 02:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
that's uh showing that the wave runners
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
and the watercraft are doing this i'm
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
happy to look at it and i'm happy to
 
02:13:59.109 --> 02:13:59.119 align:start position:0%
educate our customers
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
but until this bill and representative
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
murray's explanation i'm unaware of any
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
of this so
 
02:14:07.510 --> 02:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
if she could help me and help me out and
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
explain some of this i would really
 
02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
am i good to talk
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
nope uh does uh either representative uh
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
murray or captain don levy wish to uh
 
02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:33.920 align:start position:0%

mr chair
 
02:14:49.350 --> 02:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
this is representative smith i have i
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
object um people who come to give
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
testimony to
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
at a public hearing don't usually get to
 
02:15:00.550 --> 02:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
ask other people who are giving
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
testimony questions
 
02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
usually it's the representatives who get
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
to ask the questions others are just
 
02:15:07.199 --> 02:15:10.229 align:start position:0%
to ask the questions others are just
observers

02:15:10.229 --> 02:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
that that is true but i was just
 
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
allowing uh the representative or
 
02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
captain to respond if they wished
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
i would only say that there is a video
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
which i would be glad to send um mr
 
02:15:26.229 --> 02:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
miles uh which shows the damage from jet
 
02:15:26.239 --> 02:15:30.790 align:start position:0%
miles uh which shows the damage from jet
skis

02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay i'm happy to see that i would very
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
much like to create a dialogue with you
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
guys with you representative murray
 
02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
outside of this committee meeting
 
02:15:40.390 --> 02:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
um the the idea that that a jet ski
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
could create damage to the substrate in
 
02:15:45.750 --> 02:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
protected and sensitive areas
 
02:15:47.189 --> 02:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
this doesn't make sense to me and i'm
 
02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm informing that the committee of
 
02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
this and if if i know that we're saying
 
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
that they damage areas and we're saying
 
02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
that they're operating quickly and we're
 
02:15:55.040 --> 02:15:56.149 align:start position:0%
that they're operating quickly and we're
saying

02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
that they're disruptive but i don't know
 
02:16:01.030 --> 02:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
how and and and and
 
02:16:02.310 --> 02:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
i would resp
 
02:16:04.629 --> 02:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
mr cook
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
you hear me
 
02:16:11.189 --> 02:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
i said i didn't want a back and forth
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to have an argument going
 
02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:14.709 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to have an argument going
on

02:16:14.709 --> 02:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:16:14.719 --> 02:16:16.149 align:start position:0%
on
obviously

02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:16:18.550 --> 02:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
this is my first one of these hearings
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
and this will not happen again
 
02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
so you have representative post and
 
02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative moran in that order
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
all right uh this we're still in he's
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
still testifying
 
02:16:32.549 --> 02:16:32.559 align:start position:0%
mr cook are you finished with your
 
02:16:32.559 --> 02:16:35.349 align:start position:0%
mr cook are you finished with your
testimony

02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
he has to arm you stand by sir
 
02:16:41.110 --> 02:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
yes i'm you i apologize i'm unmuted now
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
i apologize i guess i was muted um
 
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry doing this in a zoom meeting
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
is difficult and i don't mean to create
 
02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
the back and forth or do anything
 
02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:51.270 align:start position:0%
the back and forth or do anything
disrespectful

02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
disrespectful
 
02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
um i would just suggest to the committee
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
that that uh you know that i have not
 
02:17:00.150 --> 02:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
seen and i am unaware of any evidence to
 
02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:01.190 align:start position:0%
seen and i am unaware of any evidence to
suggest

02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
02:17:03.669 --> 02:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
that the wave runners are disruptive to
 
02:17:05.509 --> 02:17:05.519 align:start position:0%
the substrate to sensitive environmental
 
02:17:05.519 --> 02:17:06.469 align:start position:0%
the substrate to sensitive environmental
areas

02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
areas
 
02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
you're banning an entire user group from
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
being able to use public areas
 
02:17:14.469 --> 02:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that is warranted
 
02:17:16.389 --> 02:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
unless there is real you know
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
significant evidence to deter to show
 
02:17:20.469 --> 02:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
that it is actually wave runners doing
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
the damage
 
02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
and that's my you know my testimony to
 
02:17:26.549 --> 02:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
the to the committee
 
02:17:38.309 --> 02:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much for taking my
 
02:17:43.589 --> 02:17:43.599 align:start position:0%
question um i i do appreciate
 
02:17:46.230 --> 02:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
the where mr cook is coming from
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
um and i would like to see evidence of
 
02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
wave runners and jet skis do i know
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of small
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
smaller lakes that people have these
 
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
i haven't noticed any damage from i have
 
02:18:13.349 --> 02:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
a family that does have some of those
 
02:18:13.359 --> 02:18:14.790 align:start position:0%
a family that does have some of those
and

02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
i i'm just interested to see if there is
 
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
really damage created by them and if we
 
02:18:22.830 --> 02:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
have laws in place
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:35.509 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
yes now i can yes you have to form this
 
02:18:43.669 --> 02:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:46.150 --> 02:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
so so i would i would like to i would
 
02:18:48.709 --> 02:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
like information on on
 
02:18:50.629 --> 02:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
that that would be my question if we
 
02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
could gather information
 
02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
and how do we do that
 
02:18:56.950 --> 02:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
um to see what kind of damage these
 
02:18:58.709 --> 02:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
actually do have
 
02:18:59.910 --> 02:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:19:01.509 --> 02:19:01.519 align:start position:0%
on the environment
 
02:19:03.509 --> 02:19:03.519 align:start position:0%
this is the question of the
 
02:19:04.830 --> 02:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
of the person
 
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
testified uh you know this is for
 
02:19:09.509 --> 02:19:09.519 align:start position:0%
everyone uh
 
02:19:12.549 --> 02:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
the you place that you when you when
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
fighting when you're asking you asking a
 
02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:16.070 align:start position:0%
fighting when you're asking you asking a
question

02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
of the witness
 
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
you're not
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
telling them
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
stuff that you
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
it's not a uh
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
you're not telling the witness anything
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
you could you
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
still it should be
 
02:19:34.309 --> 02:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
phrased in the form of a question
 
02:19:34.319 --> 02:19:35.750 align:start position:0%
phrased in the form of a question
so

02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:37.830 --> 02:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
in other words this
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
witness so and so
 
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
what uh what is this or what are you
 
02:19:46.230 --> 02:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
what is where is there any of any
 
02:19:49.030 --> 02:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
thing that you could uh and you could
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
show can you show us any uh in the
 
02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
information data
 
02:19:56.550 --> 02:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
so if you you want to have so
 
02:19:58.630 --> 02:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
please go ahead and uh
 
02:20:00.309 --> 02:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
yeah but ask it in the form of a
 
02:20:02.309 --> 02:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
question is it very difficult to be able
 
02:20:02.319 --> 02:20:04.790 align:start position:0%
question is it very difficult to be able
to

02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
get the person's attention through this
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
zoom system
 
02:20:11.349 --> 02:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i apologize for that
 
02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
so my question is mr cook would you be
 
02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
able to provide the committee
 
02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
with any uh information on those
 
02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
jet skis and watercraft that
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
you're speaking of and how it harms the
 
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
can the committee hear me
 
02:20:40.479 --> 02:20:41.349 align:start position:0%
can the committee hear me
yes

02:20:41.349 --> 02:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you
 
02:20:45.510 --> 02:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
um well that's just the the point
 
02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative post i'm saying that i'm
 
02:20:49.990 --> 02:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
unaware of any evidence to show that
 
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
that this product
 
02:20:54.309 --> 02:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh given that it's makeup given how it's
 
02:20:54.319 --> 02:20:55.510 align:start position:0%
uh given that it's makeup given how it's
constructed

02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
constructed
 
02:20:57.510 --> 02:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
could har could harm the environment um
 
02:21:00.070 --> 02:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
and i would moreover suggest that it is
 
02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
both operating with propellers and lower
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
units uh you know that is creating any
 
02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
damage to the substrate that that uh may
 
02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
occur i don't
 
02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
if i could see
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
somehow a a a
 
02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
jet pump or the the way that and i'm
 
02:21:17.429 --> 02:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
happy to provide
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
any information that any committee
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
members want with regard to how these
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
machines operate how they are
 
02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:23.349 align:start position:0%
machines operate how they are
constructed

02:21:23.349 --> 02:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
constructed
 
02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
why it is difficult for them to create
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
the damage that is being discussed that
 
02:21:29.429 --> 02:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
is the point of topic here
 
02:21:31.750 --> 02:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to to show that that and it's
 
02:21:34.150 --> 02:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
just logically uh with the way that
 
02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:35.349 align:start position:0%
just logically uh with the way that
these

02:21:35.349 --> 02:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:21:36.870 --> 02:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
machines are constructed it's very hard
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
for them to do damage to the substrate
 
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
unless they were
 
02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
i mean they would have to be really
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
doing something that would already be
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
considered a leak you know improper
 
02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
illegal under rsa270
 
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
so um i i don't i'm not aware of how
 
02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
they're doing it so if if there's
 
02:21:55.030 --> 02:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
evidence out there i'm happy to look at
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
it but i don't have any to show that
 
02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
and representative more answer
 
02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative moran for a question
 
02:22:06.469 --> 02:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh mr cook
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
do you think this bill would negatively
 
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
impact your small business
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely
 
02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:12.870 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely
absolutely

02:22:12.870 --> 02:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:22:14.230 --> 02:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
have you had an opportunity to run any
 
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
type of numbers that would
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
indicate a loss of income or revenue as
 
02:22:20.830 --> 02:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
a result of this bill
 
02:22:23.429 --> 02:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
um no i haven't i just learned about the
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
bill yesterday
 
02:22:26.469 --> 02:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's the issue most people
 
02:22:27.910 --> 02:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
in this area we didn't know about this
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh
 
02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
or i haven't heard about it and my
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
customer group hasn't told me anything
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
about it so i just know that it would
 
02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
greatly diminish you know the user
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
the the the users of this mark of this
 
02:22:42.309 --> 02:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
product in this area and any thing that
 
02:22:43.349 --> 02:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
does that
 
02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh would have a negative effect on our
 
02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
small business
 
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
and uh have you been negatively impacted
 
02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
by covert 19.
 
02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
we were at first
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
but then we also sell other products um
 
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know off-road vehicles uh that sort
 
02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
of thing and
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
as we got into the year uh it it seemed
 
02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
like more and more people because you
 
02:23:04.870 --> 02:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
can you know utilize this product in
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
socially distance get outside
 
02:23:09.190 --> 02:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh go and enjoy what new hampshire has
 
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
to offer uh we actually saw a little bit
 
02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
of a spike in business late in the year
 
02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh as you know probably well not lately
 
02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
mid may june early in the year yes may
 
02:23:22.230 --> 02:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
june no things actually started to spike
 
02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh do you think this bill would uh
 
02:23:28.630 --> 02:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
reduce your revenue again after
 
02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
seemingly having a small increase from
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
the 19 impact on your small business
 
02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so it would not only in the short
 
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
term but in the long term as well
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
do you think this bill will impact the
 
02:23:40.309 --> 02:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
your local economy
 
02:23:41.590 --> 02:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
yes i do
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:58.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:23:58.870 --> 02:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:01.270 --> 02:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
procedure is you ask one question
 
02:24:03.190 --> 02:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
and then when you run a follow-up you
 
02:24:05.349 --> 02:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
just say follow-up and there's all
 
02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
questions up to come through the chair
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:13.990 --> 02:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
again this is a learning experience for
 
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
me to be able to
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
do this by
 
02:24:19.830 --> 02:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know by zoom
 
02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:20.870 align:start position:0%
uh you know by zoom
uh

02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's so easy if you're you know you're
 
02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
here we just
 
02:24:24.399 --> 02:24:25.190 align:start position:0%
here we just
talk

02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
talk
 
02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:25.990 align:start position:0%
talk
so

02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's that for everybody that's the uh
 
02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
you have to come back to the chair and
 
02:24:34.469 --> 02:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
just say for a follow-up
 
02:24:34.479 --> 02:24:35.490 align:start position:0%
just say for a follow-up
uh

02:24:35.490 --> 02:24:35.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:37.510 align:start position:0%

okay a few people
 
02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
okay a few people have brought up the
 
02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
financial aspects to your business and i
 
02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
was just wondering would you say a high
 
02:26:08.710 --> 02:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
percentage of your customers actually
 
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
ski a jet ski in this particular
 
02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
well it's both
 
02:26:20.469 --> 02:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of customers in the local
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
area i the dealerships i own one is in
 
02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
hampton and the other one is in
 
02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:25.750 align:start position:0%
hampton and the other one is in
rochester

02:26:25.750 --> 02:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
rochester
 
02:26:28.309 --> 02:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
and we have a number of customers that
 
02:26:30.070 --> 02:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
will take their wave runners and operate
 
02:26:31.830 --> 02:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
in both areas
 
02:26:34.230 --> 02:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
but we have a large amount of them that
 
02:26:36.230 --> 02:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
do operate on the seacoast i hear
 
02:26:38.070 --> 02:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
stories of them taking their families
 
02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
out and their friends out and going down
 
02:26:41.910 --> 02:26:41.920 align:start position:0%

02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know just getting out and enjoying
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
the you know the summer and the weather

and and uh getting through those areas
and

02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
this this bill would have would have a
 
02:26:58.469 --> 02:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
serious impact on that and um you know i
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
would just hate to see that happen for
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
those folks

thank you mr chair and thank you mr cook
 
02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question have you um read
 
02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
the bill and looked at a map of exactly
 
02:27:30.790 --> 02:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
the area that it would include uh i.e
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
newcastle goat island back channel
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
mooring field
 
02:27:38.550 --> 02:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
yes i have
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:52.479 --> 02:28:01.940 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:28:01.940 --> 02:28:01.950 align:start position:0%

02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:28:15.510 --> 02:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh uh
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative mayville you had a
 
02:28:20.309 --> 02:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
question for uh
 
02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
i did thank you for taking my question i
 
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
apologize for being a little bit slow on
 
02:28:26.309 --> 02:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
the uptake as i'm trying to research
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
through this as a new member of the
 
02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:28.790 align:start position:0%
through this as a new member of the
committee

02:28:28.790 --> 02:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:28:31.590 --> 02:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to offer um or
 
02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
provide some type of
 
02:28:36.870 --> 02:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
research or articles that demonstrate
 
02:28:39.670 --> 02:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
that the rave the characteristics of the
 
02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
wave produced by these personal
 
02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:43.030 align:start position:0%
wave produced by these personal
watercraft

02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
watercraft
 
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
affect the turbidity of the water and
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
therefore affect the erosion
 
02:28:49.750 --> 02:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
of that substrate i'm just unaware of
 
02:28:51.830 --> 02:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
any and i was unable to quickly research
 
02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
and find something that demonstrated
 
02:28:56.469 --> 02:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
that because it appears that this is um
 
02:28:58.469 --> 02:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
expanding the area of limitation on
 
02:29:00.469 --> 02:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
these personal watercraft so i would
 
02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
like to see something that's that's
 
02:29:04.710 --> 02:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that the um the propellant
 
02:29:06.469 --> 02:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
of these watercraft you know exhibited
 
02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
at speed is damaging that substrate
 
02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:13.670 --> 02:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
02:29:15.270 --> 02:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh yeah
 
02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
um there was a lot of work that was done
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
on this last year and as i said the bill
 
02:29:22.469 --> 02:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
was passed unanimously uh with the field
 
02:29:24.309 --> 02:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
trips that the committee took it was
 
02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
also a video that was done to show the
 
02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:29:30.389 --> 02:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
the the area the shallowness of the area
 
02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
the sensitivity of the substrata and the
 
02:29:33.670 --> 02:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
damage that
 
02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
these type of watercraft can do i'd like
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
to iterate that this is a really small
 
02:29:41.429 --> 02:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
area and in particular bee gees is not
 
02:29:43.510 --> 02:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
effective that's well beyond this area
 
02:29:45.030 --> 02:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
this is a very small area where it's
 
02:29:46.389 --> 02:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
very shallow
 
02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
and very environmentally sensitive
 
02:29:50.389 --> 02:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
it does not affect
 
02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
very many people at all coming in here
 
02:29:55.110 --> 02:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
and the idea is that they
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
inadvertently might come in there and
 
02:30:00.469 --> 02:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
the damage is you know pretty lasting
 
02:30:03.190 --> 02:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
but i can i'm sure i can dig out that
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
video if you wanted and there's a great
 
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
deal of information um that and
 
02:30:10.710 --> 02:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
testimony from last year um around this
 
02:30:13.349 --> 02:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
issue from des i think from marine
 
02:30:13.359 --> 02:30:14.469 align:start position:0%
issue from des i think from marine
patrol

02:30:14.469 --> 02:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
patrol
 
02:30:16.070 --> 02:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
and i think a lot of people here already
 
02:30:18.150 --> 02:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
saw it with the
 
02:30:24.309 --> 02:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative mabel did you have
 
02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
02:30:33.110 --> 02:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
it does thank you i'm sorry i was not on
 
02:30:34.710 --> 02:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
the committee last year i did not attend
 
02:30:36.309 --> 02:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
those field trips and so i'm simply
 
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
seeking information but i appreciate the
 
02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:39.830 align:start position:0%
seeking information but i appreciate the
response

02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
response

response
okay

02:30:41.110 --> 02:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
okay

okay
uh

02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:45.349 align:start position:0%
uh
yes

02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
i'd like to uh a question of
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
representative murray if i could a
 
02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
question of representative murray near
 
02:30:50.080 --> 02:30:52.150 align:start position:0%
question of representative murray near
you

02:30:52.150 --> 02:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
i'm here
 
02:30:59.349 --> 02:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
a question by representative
 
02:31:00.790 --> 02:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
good morning representative thank you
 
02:31:03.270 --> 02:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh representative
 
02:31:05.270 --> 02:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
smith had uh just brought up a few
 
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
moments ago with another speaker about a
 
02:31:07.920 --> 02:31:08.790 align:start position:0%
moments ago with another speaker about a
map

02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
map
 
02:31:10.150 --> 02:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
and i recall
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
you providing us a map last year
 
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
when we heard this
 
02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:15.750 align:start position:0%
when we heard this
this

02:31:15.750 --> 02:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:31:17.110 --> 02:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
similar bill
 
02:31:19.270 --> 02:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
is it possible for the committee to get
 
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
a copy of the areas that you have
 
02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
designated in this bill
 
02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sure that there is i don't know
 
02:31:28.630 --> 02:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
if you still have a copy from the from
 
02:31:30.389 --> 02:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
the previous year you know materials
 
02:31:32.070 --> 02:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
that were attached to the bill
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure i can find the the map
 
02:31:35.910 --> 02:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
again this year
 
02:31:40.150 --> 02:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
serenia uh who's uh
 
02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
so there are no other no other hands
 
02:31:45.439 --> 02:31:46.389 align:start position:0%
so there are no other no other hands
raised

02:31:46.389 --> 02:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
raised
 
02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
are there any other uh is any other
 
02:31:51.670 --> 02:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
there are no other speakers
 
02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
there being no uh are there any is there
 
02:31:56.469 --> 02:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
anyone else in the uh audience
 
02:31:56.479 --> 02:31:57.510 align:start position:0%
anyone else in the uh audience
who

02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:32:01.270 --> 02:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
nobody's raising their hand right yeah
 
02:32:06.710 --> 02:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
sure okay that being the case
 
02:32:08.870 --> 02:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
we'll close the hearing
 
02:32:11.349 --> 02:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
sir stand by you have uh representative
 
02:32:14.230 --> 02:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
smith has your hands up all right uh
 
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
is this while
 
02:32:18.790 --> 02:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh i'll get a hold for representative
 
02:32:18.800 --> 02:32:19.750 align:start position:0%
uh i'll get a hold for representative
smith

02:32:19.750 --> 02:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
smith
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh you have uh
 
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes i had a question for captain
 
02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:26.469 align:start position:0%
yes i had a question for captain
dunleavy

02:32:26.469 --> 02:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
captain dunleavy um i know that uh the
 
02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
bill that we passed last year
 
02:32:38.960 --> 02:32:40.230 align:start position:0%
bill that we passed last year
uh

02:32:40.230 --> 02:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:45.270 --> 02:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
refined the area that was going to be um
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
included in the bill
 
02:32:50.550 --> 02:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
and uh could you tell me what the the
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
water depth is in those areas and and
 
02:32:55.830 --> 02:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
what the damage is that is has been
 
02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
being talked about
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh ma'am i can i can speak to the the
 
02:33:03.190 --> 02:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
water depth in that it varies with the
 
02:33:06.790 --> 02:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
tides again there are times when when uh
 
02:33:08.469 --> 02:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
this is high and dry
 
02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh depending upon the tide height uh it
 
02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
could be it could range from six inches
 
02:33:14.950 --> 02:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
to a couple of feet in some of these
 
02:33:14.960 --> 02:33:16.150 align:start position:0%
to a couple of feet in some of these
areas

02:33:16.150 --> 02:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
areas
 
02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh it depends on how close to shore you
 
02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:18.870 align:start position:0%
uh it depends on how close to shore you
are

02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
rather than how close you are to the to
 
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
the navigable channel
 
02:33:25.590 --> 02:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh as far as the damages are concerned i
 
02:33:27.990 --> 02:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
i i don't have the science uh i i don't
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
feel qualified to speak to the science
 
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
i do know that certainly at times of
 
02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:34.950 align:start position:0%
i do know that certainly at times of
tide

02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
tide
 
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh these are shallow areas that are
 
02:33:38.309 --> 02:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
difficult for
 
02:33:38.319 --> 02:33:39.110 align:start position:0%
difficult for
our

02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:33:41.429 --> 02:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
regular patrol craft to access due to
 
02:33:43.270 --> 02:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that they are prop driven and
 
02:33:44.710 --> 02:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
there just simply isn't enough water
 
02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:46.790 align:start position:0%
there just simply isn't enough water
depth

02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
depth
 
02:33:46.800 --> 02:33:47.670 align:start position:0%
depth
okay

02:33:47.670 --> 02:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:33:51.270 --> 02:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and oh um captain dunleavy uh
 
02:33:53.590 --> 02:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
oh follow-up question
 
02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:55.349 align:start position:0%
oh follow-up question
mister

02:33:55.349 --> 02:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
mister
 
02:33:55.359 --> 02:33:56.150 align:start position:0%
mister
um

02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:59.429 --> 02:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
the the discussion of uh
 
02:33:59.439 --> 02:34:00.550 align:start position:0%
the the discussion of uh
what

02:34:00.550 --> 02:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
motor which watercraft we're talking
 
02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:03.750 align:start position:0%
motor which watercraft we're talking
about

02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:34:06.150 --> 02:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
could you describe how the propellers
 
02:34:09.510 --> 02:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
work or how the how the water is uh
 
02:34:11.670 --> 02:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
funneled through the motor or the engine
 
02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
on these watercraft
 
02:34:16.389 --> 02:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
certainly i'd be happy to uh
 
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
this is a jet pump or a jet propelled
 
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
craft by definition
 
02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
and essentially the engine of these
 
02:34:22.800 --> 02:34:24.150 align:start position:0%
and essentially the engine of these
machines

02:34:24.150 --> 02:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
machines
 
02:34:25.830 --> 02:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
through a grate in the bottom of the
 
02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:27.429 align:start position:0%
through a grate in the bottom of the
machine

02:34:27.429 --> 02:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
machine
 
02:34:28.790 --> 02:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
sucks in
 
02:34:32.710 --> 02:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
the water and through an impeller im
 
02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:33.910 align:start position:0%
the water and through an impeller im
color

02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
color
 
02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
pushes a jet of water through a nozzle
 
02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh out the back of the machine so it is
 
02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
it is it is water pressure that is
 
02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
pushing or propelling this machine and
 
02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
this nozzle will go side to side which
 
02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
accounts for the steering
 
02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
so there is no hardware such as a shaft
 
02:34:53.590 --> 02:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
or a propeller or a rudder
 
02:34:55.990 --> 02:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
or a lower unit
 
02:34:57.670 --> 02:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
beneath the surface of the hull of this
 
02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:04.150 align:start position:0%
beneath the surface of the hull of this
machine

02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
02:35:12.870 --> 02:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
so that because there is no propeller
 
02:35:15.270 --> 02:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
sticking out then they can go in much
 
02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
shallower water than other
 
02:35:19.270 --> 02:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
moto watercraft
 
02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:20.790 align:start position:0%
moto watercraft
correct

02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:35:22.469 --> 02:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
that is accurate this is a very shallow
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
what we refer to as a shallow draft
 
02:35:29.190 --> 02:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
craft but the water is still powerful
 
02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
it it
 
02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
depending upon how much throttle is
 
02:35:33.830 --> 02:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
applied certainly
 
02:35:36.389 --> 02:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh these these it does push that machine
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:59.429 --> 02:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
um my question is about the pressure of
 
02:36:05.110 --> 02:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
the water and how like how fast is this
 
02:36:07.429 --> 02:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
water coming out and
 
02:36:09.429 --> 02:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
how many pounds per square inch are we
 
02:36:11.349 --> 02:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
talking about that would move a machine
 
02:36:22.550 --> 02:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
mr chair would you like me to take it
 
02:36:25.990 --> 02:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
this is tim dunleavy
 
02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:27.670 align:start position:0%
this is tim dunleavy
yes

02:36:27.670 --> 02:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
so so the the amount of uh pressure or
 
02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:32.710 align:start position:0%
so so the the amount of uh pressure or
um

02:36:32.710 --> 02:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
speed of that jet pump is is all
 
02:36:38.550 --> 02:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
relative to a variety of things
 
02:36:40.309 --> 02:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that if if a person is
 
02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
applying full throttle to this machine
 
02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
we're talking machines that run probably

02:49:05.349 --> 02:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
while those channels aren't necessarily
 
02:49:07.349 --> 02:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
falling under this restriction it would
 
02:49:09.349 --> 02:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
be what i would refer to as the shoulder
 
02:49:12.630 --> 02:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
waters uh for this back channel and and
 
02:49:14.230 --> 02:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
some of the small islands that you would
 
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
also observe from the causeway uh would
 
02:49:19.269 --> 02:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
be included in that area uh there are
 
02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
several um
 
02:49:23.110 --> 02:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh paddle craft operations rental
 
02:49:26.469 --> 02:49:26.479 align:start position:0%
operations in there sea kayaking uh so
 
02:49:28.230 --> 02:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
you're you're seeing a a
 
02:49:30.309 --> 02:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
a very good mix of the type of
 
02:49:33.590 --> 02:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
watercraft that use the area
 
02:49:38.309 --> 02:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:40.630 --> 02:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
and would you say these jet skis would
 
02:49:42.550 --> 02:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh in your opinion have you seen these
 
02:49:45.269 --> 02:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
jet skis being used to impact anyone
 
02:49:47.030 --> 02:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
else's um
 
02:49:49.269 --> 02:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
business that may operate in these these
 
02:49:49.279 --> 02:49:51.910 align:start position:0%
business that may operate in these these
wetlands

02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:53.349 --> 02:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
we do not see a lot of personal
 
02:49:56.070 --> 02:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
watercraft traffic in that area
 
02:49:58.389 --> 02:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
there is some
 
02:50:01.750 --> 02:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
it is it is one of several
 
02:50:04.230 --> 02:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
routes that a person can take from the
 
02:50:06.950 --> 02:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
main piscataqua river to reach the open
 
02:50:09.190 --> 02:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
waters of the atlantic
 
02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:10.070 align:start position:0%
waters of the atlantic
so

02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:11.429 --> 02:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
you know depending upon what route the
 
02:50:13.750 --> 02:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
person chooses uh they may or may not
 
02:50:15.910 --> 02:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
use these waters
 
02:50:18.389 --> 02:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
so it's it's it's a variety of levels uh
 
02:50:19.510 --> 02:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:20.790 align:start position:0%
it is not
um

02:50:20.790 --> 02:50:20.800 align:start position:0%

i had
 
02:53:04.950 --> 02:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
originally considered a place where i
 
02:53:06.950 --> 02:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
placed enough time
 
02:53:08.710 --> 02:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
to put this bill
 
02:53:08.720 --> 02:53:08.890 align:start position:0%

02:53:16.070 --> 02:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's going to happen
 
02:53:16.080 --> 02:53:18.070 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's going to happen
advisable

02:53:18.070 --> 02:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
advisable
 
02:53:20.630 --> 02:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
we will
 
02:53:22.870 --> 02:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
hope to
 
02:53:22.880 --> 02:53:23.750 align:start position:0%
hope to
right

02:53:23.750 --> 02:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:53:26.630 --> 02:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
maybe i should i will look to
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh continue
 
02:53:33.349 --> 02:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
the maybe i i think i will
 
02:53:36.150 --> 02:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
i think i'll reopen the hearing
 
02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
and then continue it
 
02:53:40.150 --> 02:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
on to another day
 
02:53:43.429 --> 02:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
just so that additional information
 
02:53:46.070 --> 02:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
can be gotten to it seems there's
 
02:53:48.630 --> 02:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
appears to be
 
02:53:48.640 --> 02:53:49.510 align:start position:0%
appears to be
some

02:53:49.510 --> 02:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
questions that need to be by some
 
02:53:52.800 --> 02:53:54.570 align:start position:0%
questions that need to be by some
representatives

02:53:54.570 --> 02:53:54.580 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
02:54:03.030 --> 02:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
i realize we have heard the bill the
 
02:54:07.990 --> 02:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:11.830 --> 02:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
and it was a 20 to nothing vote however
 
02:54:14.230 --> 02:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
all fairness and the new folks they have
 
02:54:14.240 --> 02:54:15.990 align:start position:0%
all fairness and the new folks they have
questions

02:54:15.990 --> 02:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:16.950 align:start position:0%
questions
i

02:54:16.950 --> 02:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:17.990 align:start position:0%
i
think

02:54:17.990 --> 02:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
if they deserve to get
 
02:54:23.830 --> 02:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
answers to their questions so
 
02:54:25.190 --> 02:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
i will
 
02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:26.150 align:start position:0%
i will
uh

02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:54:30.230 --> 02:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
i will just continue this bill to a time
 
02:54:33.510 --> 02:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
to to a future
 
02:54:35.269 --> 02:54:35.279 align:start position:0%

02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
meeting in the future
 
02:54:41.429 --> 02:54:41.439 align:start position:0%
have a uh a continuing hearing
 
02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
continues so
 
02:54:45.750 --> 02:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
we open the uh
 
02:54:49.110 --> 02:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
i'll open the hearing and
 
02:54:51.750 --> 02:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:54.160 align:start position:0%

any questions what i just did
 
02:55:09.830 --> 02:55:09.840 align:start position:0%

also
what

02:55:38.070 --> 02:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:40.230 --> 02:55:40.240 align:start position:0%

02:55:49.269 --> 02:55:49.279 align:start position:0%
we got you a little bit away from them
 
02:55:51.190 --> 02:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
if you changed mike's but
 
02:55:53.830 --> 02:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
yeah mike seems to keep moving
 
02:55:53.840 --> 02:55:55.510 align:start position:0%
yeah mike seems to keep moving
so

02:55:55.510 --> 02:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:02.550 --> 02:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's very faint yeah
 
02:56:04.950 --> 02:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay and uh
 
02:56:06.790 --> 02:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
we'll change back
 
02:56:10.469 --> 02:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
we'll change back aft uh after lunch
 
02:56:14.230 --> 02:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:16.550 --> 02:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
yeah it's almost as if you're way in the
 
02:56:18.550 --> 02:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
distance just like in the picture on the
 
02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:25.190 align:start position:0%
distance just like in the picture on the
screen

02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:26.790 --> 02:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
probably try to get yeah one okay maybe
 
02:56:28.309 --> 02:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
the settings you could probably put that
 
02:56:29.269 --> 02:56:29.279 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
02:56:29.279 --> 02:56:31.910 align:start position:0%
at the end
because

02:56:31.910 --> 02:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:33.990 --> 02:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
no no that works that one works the best
 
02:56:36.710 --> 02:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
that was done right
 
02:56:45.269 --> 02:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
seven years ago our forefathers brought
 
02:56:50.469 --> 02:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
forth in wisconsin and a new nation
 
02:56:52.150 --> 02:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
dedicated the proposition that all men
 
02:56:55.510 --> 02:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:59.590 --> 02:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:01.190 --> 02:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
02:57:03.830 --> 02:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:05.750 --> 02:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
good enough
 
02:57:08.630 --> 02:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
well tell me somebody i don't know
 
02:57:10.309 --> 02:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
yeah it's not 100
 
02:57:11.590 --> 02:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
not 100
 
02:57:13.670 --> 02:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
it it hasn't changed a lot andy i think
 
02:57:15.269 --> 02:57:15.279 align:start position:0%
you just raise your voice and speak
 
02:57:17.429 --> 02:57:17.439 align:start position:0%
louder we can hear you better but it's
 
02:57:18.630 --> 02:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
still your
 
02:57:20.630 --> 02:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
you were much closer to the mic at one
 
02:57:22.870 --> 02:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
point there we were hearing you fine and
 
02:57:24.389 --> 02:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
now it's sort of falling off a little
 
02:57:24.399 --> 02:57:25.110 align:start position:0%
now it's sort of falling off a little
bit

02:57:25.110 --> 02:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:57:27.670 --> 02:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
right again okay how's this
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh you're starting to get distorted now
 
02:57:31.510 --> 02:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
so you're back to that second area we
 
02:57:32.870 --> 02:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
had where we couldn't understand a word
 
02:57:35.030 --> 02:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
you said
 
02:57:38.230 --> 02:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:39.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:57:39.349 --> 02:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:57:41.510 --> 02:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
one two three four
 
02:57:44.790 --> 02:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
better much better again it's acceptable
 
02:57:46.469 --> 02:57:46.479 align:start position:0%
i think it i think it's good considering
 
02:57:48.150 --> 02:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
the circumstances we can always always
 
02:57:50.790 --> 02:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
put on headphones on our side
 
02:57:54.070 --> 02:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh we'll do as best we can as we
 
02:57:55.990 --> 02:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
we struggle through it now you know what
 
02:57:57.830 --> 02:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
will happen when you go
 
02:58:01.110 --> 02:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
off to a zoom meeting so
 
02:58:02.830 --> 02:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
this was for half
 
02:58:04.710 --> 02:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
people it's crazy there's a chair i
 
02:58:06.710 --> 02:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
think part of it is when you leave back
 
02:58:06.720 --> 02:58:07.670 align:start position:0%
think part of it is when you leave back
yep

02:58:07.670 --> 02:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:58:09.590 --> 02:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't leave your mind just if you just
 
02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
stay in the same spot stay in the motion
 
02:58:11.680 --> 02:58:12.950 align:start position:0%
stay in the same spot stay in the motion
yeah

02:58:12.950 --> 02:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:58:14.790 --> 02:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
you have to get something to measure
 
02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:15.990 align:start position:0%
you have to get something to measure
yeah

02:58:15.990 --> 02:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:58:21.750 --> 02:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:25.030 --> 02:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
i wonder if i put my mask over it
 
02:58:25.040 --> 02:58:25.990 align:start position:0%
i wonder if i put my mask over it
anyway

02:58:25.990 --> 02:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:58:30.950 --> 02:58:30.960 align:start position:0%

at least
 
02:58:40.469 --> 02:58:40.479 align:start position:0%
i don't have a problem with it
 
03:55:01.030 --> 03:55:01.040 align:start position:0%

04:04:04.870 --> 04:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to open up the hearing for
 
04:04:11.590 --> 04:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:13.750 --> 04:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
 
04:04:13.760 --> 04:04:15.189 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
committee

04:04:15.189 --> 04:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:04:17.429 --> 04:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
my name for the record is suzanne smith
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
i represent the towns of plymouth hebron
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
and holderness grafton county district 8
 
04:04:23.910 --> 04:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm here as the prime sponsor of
 
04:04:26.550 --> 04:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 344
 
04:04:29.750 --> 04:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
relative to temporary docs
 
04:04:31.910 --> 04:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
this bill was a request of the
 
04:04:34.550 --> 04:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
commission to study structures in or on
 
04:04:37.269 --> 04:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
non-tidal waters otherwise known as the
 
04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
dock commission
 
04:04:43.189 --> 04:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
and this bill amends three statutes that
 
04:04:44.950 --> 04:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
relate to docs
 
04:04:46.469 --> 04:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
and their
 
04:04:48.070 --> 04:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
i'd say their housekeeping but that's
 
04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
usually the kiss of death for a bill is
 
04:04:52.870 --> 04:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
to say it's housekeeping um in the the
 
04:04:55.750 --> 04:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
part one of the bill um if you have a
 
04:04:58.469 --> 04:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
copy of it it's on line three
 
04:05:01.349 --> 04:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
just clarifies that it is not just
 
04:05:03.429 --> 04:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
seasonal docks we're talking about its
 
04:05:06.309 --> 04:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
temporary seasonal docks just in case
 
04:05:08.150 --> 04:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
there's any confusion on the part of the
 
04:05:08.160 --> 04:05:09.590 align:start position:0%
there's any confusion on the part of the
public

04:05:09.590 --> 04:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:05:10.950 --> 04:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
part two
 
04:05:10.960 --> 04:05:11.750 align:start position:0%
part two
uh

04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:05:11.760 --> 04:05:13.030 align:start position:0%
uh
removes

04:05:13.030 --> 04:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
removes
 
04:05:13.040 --> 04:05:14.229 align:start position:0%
removes
rivers

04:05:14.229 --> 04:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
rivers
 
04:05:16.870 --> 04:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
from the statute that allows you to just
 
04:05:19.510 --> 04:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
get a permit by notification
 
04:05:21.830 --> 04:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh which means you just write a letter
 
04:05:24.389 --> 04:05:24.399 align:start position:0%
to des and you can put in your doc
 
04:05:26.550 --> 04:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
without any uh
 
04:05:28.630 --> 04:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
any bureaucratic
 
04:05:28.640 --> 04:05:29.510 align:start position:0%
any bureaucratic
tape

04:05:29.510 --> 04:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
tape
 
04:05:33.269 --> 04:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
and so it just excludes rivers from this
 
04:05:36.630 --> 04:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
statute because rivers where the water
 
04:05:39.349 --> 04:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
is flowing you would not want a dock
 
04:05:41.910 --> 04:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
heading straight out into a river
 
04:05:44.790 --> 04:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh it could cause damage to boats damage
 
04:05:46.309 --> 04:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
to the environment
 
04:05:48.950 --> 04:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
and damage to the dock so it just
 
04:05:51.510 --> 04:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
removes rivers from temporary seasonal
 
04:05:54.550 --> 04:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
dock statute that we already have
 
04:05:56.070 --> 04:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
and then the third part of the build
 
04:05:59.510 --> 04:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
which is line 17 pertains to the doc
 
04:06:02.309 --> 04:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
registration criteria we passed a doc
 
04:06:04.630 --> 04:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
registration process
 
04:06:07.030 --> 04:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh in 2020
 
04:06:09.830 --> 04:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
and this just clarifies that if you wish
 
04:06:13.349 --> 04:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
to use the doc registration process
 
04:06:13.359 --> 04:06:14.469 align:start position:0%
to use the doc registration process
to

04:06:14.469 --> 04:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:06:16.469 --> 04:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
install your new doc
 
04:06:18.229 --> 04:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
if you have pending
 
04:06:21.269 --> 04:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
or final adverse action from a municipal
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
or state authority or pending civil
 
04:06:26.229 --> 04:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
action you cannot use the doc
 
04:06:29.349 --> 04:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
registration process to get your new doc
 
04:06:32.150 --> 04:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
so that is the gist of the bill i can
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
try to answer questions but i'm hoping
 
04:06:36.950 --> 04:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
that there are people from in the uh
 
04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
audience wishing to speak that can
 
04:06:40.630 --> 04:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
clarify it better than i can
 
04:06:44.150 --> 04:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative smith are there

04:08:28.710 --> 04:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:30.150 --> 04:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:08:30.160 --> 04:08:31.189 align:start position:0%
this bill
corrects

04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
corrects
 
04:08:34.229 --> 04:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
language that was changed unfortunately
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
last year
 
04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
last year within the
 
04:08:39.349 --> 04:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
structures on public waters commission
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
there was a discussion about expanding
 
04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
this process to include rivers this
 
04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
process is an exemption from the
 
04:08:47.189 --> 04:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
permitting requirements specific to
 
04:08:49.510 --> 04:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
certain single seasonal docks
 
04:08:51.349 --> 04:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
and they're seasonal docks which have no
 
04:08:53.750 --> 04:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
anchor constructed at the shoreline
 
04:08:56.469 --> 04:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
so they're for stillwater areas
 
04:08:58.389 --> 04:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
where you're really just setting a
 
04:08:59.830 --> 04:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
structure in place that you can tie a
 
04:09:02.469 --> 04:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
boat to or walk out and fish off of
 
04:09:03.990 --> 04:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
so there was a discussion of adding
 
04:09:06.950 --> 04:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
these two rivers and streams and
 
04:09:08.469 --> 04:09:08.479 align:start position:0%
that may have seemed like a good idea at
 
04:09:10.630 --> 04:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
the time but after some discussions and
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
after the after the bill was introduced
 
04:09:14.229 --> 04:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
and discussions with the new hampshire
 
04:09:15.590 --> 04:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
rivers committees
 
04:09:17.349 --> 04:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
it was decided that such a dock which
 
04:09:19.429 --> 04:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
has no modification of the bank would be
 
04:09:21.510 --> 04:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
unstable and be a potential safety
 
04:09:23.510 --> 04:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
hazard on a river or stream because it's
 
04:09:25.510 --> 04:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
likely to break free
 
04:09:27.510 --> 04:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
especially in times of flood and where
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
we have so many dams in this state if
 
04:09:31.349 --> 04:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
something were to break free with a boat
 
04:09:33.510 --> 04:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
attached or without a boat attached it
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
all ends up in some dams rack
 
04:09:37.510 --> 04:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
downstream it becomes a safety hazard it
 
04:09:39.750 --> 04:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
puts stress on on that dam or it ends up
 
04:09:41.910 --> 04:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
in someone else's frontage or it becomes
 
04:09:41.920 --> 04:09:42.710 align:start position:0%
in someone else's frontage or it becomes
a

04:09:42.710 --> 04:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:09:45.670 --> 04:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
hazard to boaters or swimmers elsewhere
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
down current
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
so it was intended that
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
when the bill which added this language
 
04:09:54.389 --> 04:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
this exemption to rivers and streams it
 
04:09:57.429 --> 04:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
was intended that when it reached
 
04:09:59.910 --> 04:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
the opposite side of the legislature
 
04:10:03.349 --> 04:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
after crossover it would be amended and
 
04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
those those provisions would be removed
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately
 
04:10:08.550 --> 04:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
as we all know last year's sessions were
 
04:10:10.469 --> 04:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
somewhat interrupted
 
04:10:12.150 --> 04:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
and the bill slipped through without an
 
04:10:13.990 --> 04:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to correct it and remove the
 
04:10:16.710 --> 04:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
rivers and streams
 
04:10:16.720 --> 04:10:17.830 align:start position:0%
rivers and streams
provisions

04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
04:10:19.590 --> 04:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
so that's how we got to this point and
 
04:10:21.750 --> 04:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
why that correction needs to be made
 
04:10:23.670 --> 04:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
again our biggest concerns here when
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
they came up were
 
04:10:27.910 --> 04:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
public safety concerns specific to the
 
04:10:30.870 --> 04:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
fact that this exemption prohibits docks
 
04:10:32.469 --> 04:10:32.479 align:start position:0%
it only applies to docks that don't have
 
04:10:34.309 --> 04:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
an anchor at the shoreline and those are
 
04:10:35.830 --> 04:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
exactly the docks that you don't want to
 
04:10:38.550 --> 04:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
have on a flowing body of water where
 
04:10:40.229 --> 04:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
something might break free and it's
 
04:10:42.630 --> 04:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
where it's most likely to be a risk
 
04:10:45.429 --> 04:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
so we support this
 
04:10:46.630 --> 04:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
sorry that we couldn't get it cleaned up
 
04:10:48.150 --> 04:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
last year but we very much support this
 
04:10:50.870 --> 04:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
language change for this year
 
04:10:53.110 --> 04:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to ask or answer any questions
 
04:10:54.950 --> 04:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
for anyone if they have them
 
04:10:54.960 --> 04:10:56.070 align:start position:0%
for anyone if they have them
um

and holderness grafton eighth and i'm
 
04:57:20.470 --> 04:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
here as the prime sponsor of house bill
 
04:57:25.990 --> 04:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
193 house bill 193 relative to
 
04:57:28.550 --> 04:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
timber trespass laws
 
04:57:31.190 --> 04:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
was introduced last year as a different
 
04:57:34.390 --> 04:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
bill it was amended and cleaned up and
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
passed this committee unanimously passed
 
04:57:39.350 --> 04:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
the floor on the consent calendar
 
04:57:42.070 --> 04:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
went to the senate where covid hit and
 
04:57:43.670 --> 04:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
it was tabled
 
04:57:46.310 --> 04:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
so um i have took the liberty of
 
04:57:48.150 --> 04:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
reintroducing it because it is an
 
04:57:50.310 --> 04:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
important bill it does not change the
 
04:57:50.320 --> 04:57:51.590 align:start position:0%
important bill it does not change the
penalties

04:57:51.590 --> 04:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
for taking timber timber trespass which
 
04:57:56.788 --> 04:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
is usually if there's a logging job
 
04:58:02.470 --> 04:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
being done if someone uh cuts trees
 
04:58:04.628 --> 04:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
on someone else's property they are
 
04:58:07.270 --> 04:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
liable and that is in the statute now
 
04:58:10.470 --> 04:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it also changes
 
04:58:12.470 --> 04:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
it somewhat so that
 
04:58:14.788 --> 04:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
if you are the owner
 
04:58:17.750 --> 04:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
of the property and you tell the logger
 
04:58:19.750 --> 04:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
these are all my trees over here these
 
04:58:22.550 --> 04:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
two acres over there cut those and
 
04:58:24.868 --> 04:58:24.878 align:start position:0%
they're really not your property
 
04:58:27.430 --> 04:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
the logger is not liable you are liable
 
04:58:29.350 --> 04:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
because you told them to cut them there
 
04:58:31.510 --> 04:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
so who's ever responsible for the trees
 
04:58:33.430 --> 04:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
being cut whether it's the log or the
 
04:58:36.150 --> 04:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
forester or the owner
 
04:58:38.310 --> 04:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
it would make them liable for the timber
 
04:58:40.628 --> 04:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
trespass not just the person who is
 
04:58:42.550 --> 04:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
doing the actual cutting
 
04:58:45.030 --> 04:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
and that's all that the bill does
 
04:58:47.110 --> 04:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
it does not change the penalties that
 
04:58:49.910 --> 04:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
are already in place
 
04:58:55.270 --> 04:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:56.868 --> 04:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
and i will take questions if you have
 
04:58:56.878 --> 04:59:21.110 align:start position:0%
and i will take questions if you have
any

04:59:21.110 --> 04:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:25.680 --> 04:59:26.788 align:start position:0%
 
sure

04:59:26.788 --> 04:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:59:28.788 --> 04:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
i will take a question
 
04:59:31.430 --> 04:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:31.440 --> 04:59:33.190 align:start position:0%
 
currently

04:59:33.190 --> 04:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:59:36.150 --> 04:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
if a landowner tells a logger to cut
 
04:59:38.628 --> 04:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
land on someone else's property who's
 
04:59:43.510 --> 04:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:43.520 --> 04:59:46.310 align:start position:0%
 
correct

04:59:46.310 --> 04:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:48.628 --> 04:59:48.638 align:start position:0%
who is is it water's responsibility for
 
04:59:48.638 --> 04:59:49.590 align:start position:0%
who is is it water's responsibility for
the

04:59:49.590 --> 04:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:59:53.190 --> 04:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:57.590 --> 04:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
if for example i have 20 acres
 
04:59:59.510 --> 04:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i want to log
 
05:00:01.830 --> 05:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
10 of them
 
05:00:05.750 --> 05:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
and i misrepresent the property and half
 
05:00:08.390 --> 05:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
of that property is not mine it's on my
 
05:00:10.628 --> 05:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
neighbor's property
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
then i would be liable if this law
 
05:00:12.718 --> 05:00:13.670 align:start position:0%
then i would be liable if this law
passed

05:00:13.670 --> 05:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
passed
 
05:00:15.750 --> 05:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
for telling the logger that is my
 
05:00:18.310 --> 05:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
property when it wasn't my property
 
05:00:20.470 --> 05:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
and i believe that someone i'm hoping
 
05:00:22.470 --> 05:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
someone from a department of forest and
 
05:00:24.150 --> 05:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
lands is here or
 
05:00:27.350 --> 05:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
jason stock from timberland owners to uh
 
05:00:29.830 --> 05:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
help me out if that needs to happen i
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
don't see them on the list of attendees
 
05:00:31.680 --> 05:00:33.190 align:start position:0%
don't see them on the list of attendees
though

05:00:33.190 --> 05:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
though
 
05:00:35.510 --> 05:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
but yeah that is that is what the law
 
05:00:37.670 --> 05:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
would do it doesn't it's just that if
 
05:00:37.680 --> 05:00:39.030 align:start position:0%
would do it doesn't it's just that if
you're

05:00:39.030 --> 05:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:00:41.270 --> 05:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
if you're in good faith the logger and
 
05:00:43.270 --> 05:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
someone tells you that you that it's
 
05:00:45.190 --> 05:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
their property
 
05:00:46.948 --> 05:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
it's their responsibility to know what
 
05:00:49.110 --> 05:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
it they own
 
05:00:58.948 --> 05:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:14.550 --> 05:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:16.550 --> 05:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not hearing any questions are there
 
05:01:16.560 --> 05:01:17.910 align:start position:0%
i'm not hearing any questions are there
questions

05:01:17.910 --> 05:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:01:20.470 --> 05:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh no we're just i was just trying to
 
05:01:20.480 --> 05:01:22.070 align:start position:0%
uh no we're just i was just trying to
determine

05:01:22.070 --> 05:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
determine
 
05:01:22.080 --> 05:01:23.190 align:start position:0%
determine
okay

05:01:23.190 --> 05:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:01:25.590 --> 05:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
actually two hands raised i do have a
 
05:01:25.600 --> 05:01:28.070 align:start position:0%
actually two hands raised i do have a
question

05:01:28.070 --> 05:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:34.788 --> 05:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:56.708 --> 05:01:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:58.788 --> 05:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
yes i do and thank you for recognizing
 
05:02:01.430 --> 05:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
me um i would like to know if that
 
05:02:03.750 --> 05:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
creates a situation up
 
05:02:06.788 --> 05:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
he told me the other one refuses it how
 
05:02:06.798 --> 05:02:07.670 align:start position:0%
he told me the other one refuses it how
how

05:02:07.670 --> 05:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
how
 
05:02:10.390 --> 05:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
would we balance that how would you know
 
05:02:13.110 --> 05:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
make that determination
 
05:02:14.788 --> 05:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
about who said what
 
05:02:17.750 --> 05:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
on something like that
 
05:02:22.390 --> 05:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't i mean
 
05:02:26.708 --> 05:02:26.718 align:start position:0%
when you
 
05:02:30.310 --> 05:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
file an intent to cut order
 
05:02:31.910 --> 05:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
it goes through the
 
05:02:31.920 --> 05:02:35.510 align:start position:0%
it goes through the
municipality

05:02:35.510 --> 05:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:37.830 --> 05:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
and you state on it how many acres you
 
05:02:39.270 --> 05:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
have and how much you're going to have
 
05:02:39.280 --> 05:02:40.470 align:start position:0%
have and how much you're going to have
cut

05:02:40.470 --> 05:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
cut
 
05:02:40.480 --> 05:02:41.270 align:start position:0%
cut
so

05:02:41.270 --> 05:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:02:44.390 --> 05:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
i would i mean i'm not
 
05:02:47.270 --> 05:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
i'm only looking at the statute i have
 
05:02:48.788 --> 05:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
in front of me which is what the
 
05:02:50.310 --> 05:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
penalties are
 
05:02:52.708 --> 05:02:52.718 align:start position:0%
and who is responsible i don't i don't
 
05:02:54.390 --> 05:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
know for sure how
 
05:02:56.948 --> 05:02:56.958 align:start position:0%
i don't know the fine points there
 
05:02:59.750 --> 05:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
so i can't answer that question
 
05:03:02.628 --> 05:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
without saying that if you own property
 
05:03:06.070 --> 05:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:08.070 --> 05:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
maybe i might help out a little bit on
 
05:03:08.080 --> 05:03:08.948 align:start position:0%
maybe i might help out a little bit on
that

05:03:08.948 --> 05:03:08.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:08.958 --> 05:03:10.470 align:start position:0%
that
but

05:03:10.470 --> 05:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:03:12.150 --> 05:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
this is uh
 
05:03:14.868 --> 05:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
these are basically
 
05:03:24.150 --> 05:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:26.070 --> 05:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
we can't i can't really hear anyone in
 
05:03:27.270 --> 05:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
the room
 
05:03:30.788 --> 05:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
all i can hear are the zoom people
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
and we cannot hear the room
 
05:03:33.600 --> 05:03:39.830 align:start position:0%
and we cannot hear the room
here

05:03:39.830 --> 05:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:42.150 --> 05:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
can't hear you mr chair
 
05:03:44.150 --> 05:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
05:03:46.310 --> 05:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
coming through is muffled and not
 
05:03:46.320 --> 05:03:54.550 align:start position:0%
coming through is muffled and not
legible

05:03:54.550 --> 05:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:56.868 --> 05:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
you're getting your exercise today
 
05:03:56.878 --> 05:03:57.910 align:start position:0%
you're getting your exercise today
yeah

05:03:57.910 --> 05:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:03:59.190 --> 05:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
how's that
 
05:04:02.628 --> 05:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
better good that's good oh okay
 
05:04:04.470 --> 05:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
they heard
 
05:04:06.230 --> 05:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
yeah that one works that works yeah
 
05:04:14.788 --> 05:04:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:16.868 --> 05:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
i think just uh
 
05:04:18.788 --> 05:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
all this is doing is
 
05:04:18.798 --> 05:04:19.830 align:start position:0%
all this is doing is
uh

05:04:19.830 --> 05:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:04:21.030 --> 05:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
laying out
 
05:04:21.040 --> 05:04:22.390 align:start position:0%
laying out
alexa

05:04:22.390 --> 05:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
alexa
 
05:04:29.270 --> 05:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:29.280 --> 05:04:46.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:04:46.390 --> 05:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:50.470 --> 05:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:52.550 --> 05:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
somebody's been unmuting us for some
 
05:04:54.390 --> 05:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
reason it's
 
05:04:56.628 --> 05:04:56.638 align:start position:0%
well i was just muted and i unmuted
 
05:04:58.868 --> 05:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
myself and i was i was muted and
 
05:05:00.550 --> 05:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
somebody unmuted me
 
05:05:03.190 --> 05:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
and the the whole general room is now
 
05:05:03.200 --> 05:05:08.390 align:start position:0%
and the the whole general room is now
muted

05:05:08.390 --> 05:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:10.948 --> 05:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
the in-person people are muted and poor
 
05:05:13.030 --> 05:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative harb's ma hand is
 
05:05:14.708 --> 05:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
probably getting tired from holding up
 
05:05:18.070 --> 05:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:20.230 --> 05:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative smith i appreciate you
 
05:05:22.470 --> 05:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
recognizing my hand we should probably
 
05:05:22.480 --> 05:05:23.430 align:start position:0%
recognizing my hand we should probably
be

05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:05:26.310 --> 05:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
conversation without the main room
 
05:05:28.708 --> 05:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
i know well the chair has to
 
05:05:30.390 --> 05:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
they have to get their act together well
 
05:05:32.628 --> 05:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
it looks like they're unmuted now
 
05:05:39.670 --> 05:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:49.270 --> 05:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:50.230 --> 05:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:05:52.948 --> 05:05:52.958 align:start position:0%
i think maybe representative
 
05:05:54.470 --> 05:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
might be
 
05:05:56.788 --> 05:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
trying to help being a practicing
 
05:05:58.150 --> 05:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
attorney you might
 
05:06:01.350 --> 05:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
want to respond to what the question is
 
05:06:01.360 --> 05:06:02.868 align:start position:0%
want to respond to what the question is
concerning

05:06:02.868 --> 05:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
05:06:02.878 --> 05:06:04.788 align:start position:0%
concerning
well

05:06:04.788 --> 05:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:06:06.550 --> 05:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you very much for
 
05:06:08.948 --> 05:06:08.958 align:start position:0%
recognizing me um i don't want to get
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
into details with the evidentiary
 
05:06:13.430 --> 05:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
question but that is what the court and
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
the judge would decide who said what and
 
05:06:18.470 --> 05:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
what was documented
 
05:06:20.788 --> 05:06:20.798 align:start position:0%
but i do have a question if you could
 
05:06:24.470 --> 05:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
take it um representative smith taking
 
05:06:27.190 --> 05:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
my question for the sake of clarity as
 
05:06:29.830 --> 05:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
the chair mentioned i i am a practicing
 
05:06:33.350 --> 05:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
attorney i think if you would entertain
 
05:06:35.110 --> 05:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
making a motion
 
05:06:39.750 --> 05:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
on article one and to add before you
 
05:06:41.990 --> 05:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
bold or cause
 
05:06:44.390 --> 05:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
add negligently because i think by
 
05:06:46.788 --> 05:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
deleting and not inserting negligently
 
05:06:48.708 --> 05:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
it leads me to question
 
05:06:49.910 --> 05:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
what's the
 
05:06:52.230 --> 05:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
level of cause there so it's in the
 
05:06:55.030 --> 05:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
first part no person shall negligently
 
05:06:58.628 --> 05:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
cut my suggestion is or negligently
 
05:06:58.638 --> 05:06:59.750 align:start position:0%
cut my suggestion is or negligently
cause

05:06:59.750 --> 05:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
cause
 
05:07:02.628 --> 05:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
i would add the same comment to article
 
05:07:02.638 --> 05:07:04.230 align:start position:0%
i would add the same comment to article
2.1

05:07:04.230 --> 05:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
2.1
 
05:07:05.510 --> 05:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
that says
 
05:07:08.470 --> 05:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
or cause to be cut that article says
 
05:07:08.480 --> 05:07:09.830 align:start position:0%
or cause to be cut that article says
recklessly

05:07:09.830 --> 05:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
recklessly
 
05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
though i would ask if you would
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
entertain putting a an amendment or
 
05:07:15.830 --> 05:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
recklessly cause
 
05:07:17.910 --> 05:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
that would then be consistent with the
 
05:07:21.270 --> 05:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
first part of the article um
 
05:07:23.190 --> 05:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
as a practicing attorney i think by
 
05:07:25.510 --> 05:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
putting the karma in there it doesn't
 
05:07:27.750 --> 05:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
carry forward the negligently or
 
05:07:27.760 --> 05:07:28.948 align:start position:0%
carry forward the negligently or
recklessly

05:07:28.948 --> 05:07:28.958 align:start position:0%
recklessly
 
05:07:30.708 --> 05:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
i think it's your same intent but it
 
05:07:33.030 --> 05:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
would be clearer to put it in thank you
 
05:07:34.470 --> 05:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
right right
 
05:07:37.590 --> 05:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i as the notes i have written down
 
05:07:41.110 --> 05:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
from uh thank you representative harp
 
05:07:43.350 --> 05:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
the language that is
 
05:07:46.310 --> 05:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
in here now mimics the slash law which
 
05:07:48.628 --> 05:07:48.638 align:start position:0%
we already have in place
 
05:07:51.670 --> 05:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
i mean i believe that is what um
 
05:07:53.430 --> 05:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
that is what i have written in my notes
 
05:07:53.440 --> 05:07:54.230 align:start position:0%
that is what i have written in my notes
so

05:07:54.230 --> 05:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:07:56.470 --> 05:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
i would want to check with uh i mean
 
05:07:58.230 --> 05:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
it's fine with me to do it means we
 
05:07:59.830 --> 05:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
can't execute today it means we have to
 
05:08:04.868 --> 05:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:06.788 --> 05:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
i would i'm hoping someone is going to
 
05:08:06.798 --> 05:08:07.830 align:start position:0%
i would i'm hoping someone is going to
have

05:08:07.830 --> 05:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:08:10.150 --> 05:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
is going to speak oh yes
 
05:08:12.230 --> 05:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
speak on this and they may be able to
 
05:08:15.270 --> 05:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
clarify that this indeed does work this
 
05:08:20.070 --> 05:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:24.310 --> 05:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
i want to go back to representative
 
05:08:24.320 --> 05:08:25.430 align:start position:0%
i want to go back to representative
certainly

05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:08:27.830 --> 05:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
the question has been asked
 
05:08:31.350 --> 05:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:37.190 --> 05:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:39.270 --> 05:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
05:08:41.750 --> 05:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
for the most part i just find it's a
 
05:08:41.760 --> 05:08:45.030 align:start position:0%
for the most part i just find it's a
confusing

05:08:45.030 --> 05:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:46.948 --> 05:08:46.958 align:start position:0%
statement you know
 
05:08:46.958 --> 05:08:49.910 align:start position:0%
statement you know
that

05:08:49.910 --> 05:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:53.190 --> 05:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
you'd have to have some way to show
 
05:08:53.200 --> 05:08:54.150 align:start position:0%
you'd have to have some way to show
that

05:08:54.150 --> 05:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:08:57.510 --> 05:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
the person misrepresented it
 
05:08:59.830 --> 05:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
either the landowner or the timber owner
 
05:09:02.788 --> 05:09:02.798 align:start position:0%
the timber person
 
05:09:02.798 --> 05:09:03.590 align:start position:0%
the timber person
well

05:09:03.590 --> 05:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:09:04.948 --> 05:09:04.958 align:start position:0%
just that the law
 
05:09:09.430 --> 05:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:09.440 --> 05:09:20.948 align:start position:0%
 
negligently

05:09:20.948 --> 05:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
i can explain this a little bit um mr
 
05:09:26.390 --> 05:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
chair if you're negligent
 
05:09:28.868 --> 05:09:28.878 align:start position:0%
it's a civil penalty
 
05:09:30.868 --> 05:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
it's and negligent means you weren't
 
05:09:32.628 --> 05:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
really paying attention and you cut it
 
05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
by mistake
 
05:09:36.868 --> 05:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
and then reckless is worse than
 
05:09:38.708 --> 05:09:38.718 align:start position:0%
negligent it's a criminal offense
 
05:09:41.350 --> 05:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
because it states that you did know it
 
05:09:43.590 --> 05:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
and then there's knowingly which is
 
05:09:45.590 --> 05:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
worst and that is purposeful and those
 
05:09:47.270 --> 05:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
are all terms that are defined in
 
05:09:47.280 --> 05:09:49.190 align:start position:0%
are all terms that are defined in
statute

05:09:49.190 --> 05:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
and the reckless
 
05:09:53.030 --> 05:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
one is a criminal offense and it's a
 
05:09:55.110 --> 05:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
class b felony
 
05:09:56.708 --> 05:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
if the loss is
 
05:09:59.510 --> 05:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
less greater than a thousand dollars the
 
05:10:02.310 --> 05:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
civil penalty the fine is between three
 
05:10:05.430 --> 05:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
and ten times the cost of the the value
 
05:10:09.190 --> 05:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
of the timber that was taken
 
05:10:13.110 --> 05:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:14.628 --> 05:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
05:10:32.230 --> 05:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:39.750 --> 05:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
05:10:41.750 --> 05:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
jason stock
 
05:10:44.708 --> 05:10:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:47.910 --> 05:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes jason stock
 
05:10:49.430 --> 05:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
for the for the record my name is jason
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
stock on the i'm i'm the executive
 
05:10:56.390 --> 05:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
director of the new hampshire timberland
 
05:10:58.628 --> 05:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
owners association and
 
05:10:58.638 --> 05:10:59.510 align:start position:0%
owners association and
we

05:10:59.510 --> 05:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:11:01.510 --> 05:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
come today
 
05:11:05.190 --> 05:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of house bill 193
 
05:11:07.910 --> 05:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
we supported it last year and as was
 
05:11:11.670 --> 05:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
stated earlier this was a victim of the
 
05:11:13.750 --> 05:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
disruption of last year's legislative
 
05:11:13.760 --> 05:11:16.150 align:start position:0%
disruption of last year's legislative
session

05:11:16.150 --> 05:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
session
 
05:11:19.110 --> 05:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
we think the the bill adds continuity to
 
05:11:20.070 --> 05:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
the law
 
05:11:21.510 --> 05:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
um to the
 
05:11:23.910 --> 05:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
to the deceptive forestry law when i say
 
05:11:26.470 --> 05:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
continuity and consistency
 
05:11:28.550 --> 05:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
i'm using those interchangeably but it
 
05:11:30.070 --> 05:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
adds that
 
05:11:32.868 --> 05:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
consistency continuity between those
 
05:11:35.430 --> 05:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
this law and the
 
05:11:37.590 --> 05:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
slash laws
 
05:11:39.910 --> 05:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
we also believe that it does provide
 
05:11:42.550 --> 05:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
some flexibility for enforcement to
 
05:11:43.990 --> 05:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
actually go in
 
05:11:45.910 --> 05:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
and if there is in fact a timber
 
05:11:45.920 --> 05:11:47.350 align:start position:0%
and if there is in fact a timber
trespass

05:11:47.350 --> 05:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
trespass
 
05:11:49.830 --> 05:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
and really the party at fault is is not
 
05:11:52.070 --> 05:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
the the actual logger themselves they
 
05:11:52.080 --> 05:11:53.110 align:start position:0%
the the actual logger themselves they
were

05:11:53.110 --> 05:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:11:53.120 --> 05:11:54.628 align:start position:0%
were
misinformed

05:11:54.628 --> 05:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
misinformed
 
05:11:57.910 --> 05:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
um it gives enforcement the authority to
 
05:11:58.948 --> 05:11:58.958 align:start position:0%
go and
 
05:12:00.788 --> 05:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
actually pursue the party that was
 
05:12:03.110 --> 05:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
responsible for the
 
05:12:05.830 --> 05:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
for the actual trespass
 
05:12:08.628 --> 05:12:08.638 align:start position:0%
i've spoken you know as a as a landowner
 
05:12:08.638 --> 05:12:10.390 align:start position:0%
i've spoken you know as a as a landowner
association

05:12:10.390 --> 05:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
association
 
05:12:12.628 --> 05:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
we also we represent the landowners but
 
05:12:15.430 --> 05:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
we also represent loggers consulting
 
05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
foresters as well as mills and when i
 
05:12:17.760 --> 05:12:18.628 align:start position:0%
foresters as well as mills and when i
speak

05:12:18.628 --> 05:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
speak
 
05:12:21.430 --> 05:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
discuss this bill with
 
05:12:24.230 --> 05:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
loggers and foresters
 
05:12:26.628 --> 05:12:26.638 align:start position:0%
they all they have everyone seemed to
 
05:12:30.310 --> 05:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
have a story of a situation where
 
05:12:33.190 --> 05:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
the landowner said all right yep i own
 
05:12:35.830 --> 05:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
to the backstone wall and
 
05:12:38.788 --> 05:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
that's that's the extent of my ownership
 
05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
and they conduct a timber sale and turns
 
05:12:44.708 --> 05:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
out they didn't own to the backstone
 
05:12:44.718 --> 05:12:46.470 align:start position:0%
out they didn't own to the backstone
wall

05:12:46.470 --> 05:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
wall
 
05:12:46.480 --> 05:12:47.670 align:start position:0%
wall
and

05:12:47.670 --> 05:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:12:49.990 --> 05:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
right now the way the the law reads is
 
05:12:53.270 --> 05:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
the only individual that is that
 
05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
division of forest and lands can pursue
 
05:12:59.190 --> 05:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
can pursue is the individual that that
 
05:12:59.200 --> 05:13:00.470 align:start position:0%
can pursue is the individual that that
cuts

05:13:00.470 --> 05:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
cuts
 
05:13:02.788 --> 05:13:02.798 align:start position:0%
cuts or carries away that timber in this
 
05:13:06.230 --> 05:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
case the logger this will enable
 
05:13:06.240 --> 05:13:06.948 align:start position:0%
case the logger this will enable
the

05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:13:09.030 --> 05:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
this will enable the division of forests
 
05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
and land in those forest ranges to say
 
05:13:13.270 --> 05:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
all right let's dig a little bit deeper
 
05:13:15.510 --> 05:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
let's see who really was responsible and
 
05:13:19.270 --> 05:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
was this was this parcel misrepresented
 
05:13:21.830 --> 05:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
and uh so again
 
05:13:23.590 --> 05:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
due to the the fact that we think that
 
05:13:26.230 --> 05:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
adds it adds some clarity it gives that
 
05:13:28.788 --> 05:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
flexibility and it really enables the
 
05:13:30.708 --> 05:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
the forest rangers to pursue who is
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
truly at fault
 
05:13:35.030 --> 05:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
we we come today in front of you and
 
05:13:39.430 --> 05:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
testify in support of house bill 193.
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
with respect to the the idea of changing
 
05:13:45.110 --> 05:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
and inserting the word recklessly
 
05:13:47.990 --> 05:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
i would really want to defer to
 
05:13:50.070 --> 05:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
the the folks in the division of forests
 
05:13:51.430 --> 05:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
and lands
 
05:13:53.270 --> 05:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
i am not an attorney
 
05:13:55.190 --> 05:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
but i do know that
 
05:13:57.910 --> 05:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
negligently recklessly and on purpose as
 
05:14:00.628 --> 05:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
representative smith had said
 
05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
those do have different
 
05:14:05.430 --> 05:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh different weights and represent
 
05:14:07.830 --> 05:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
culpable states of mind and i would
 
05:14:09.350 --> 05:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
before we
 
05:14:11.830 --> 05:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
before the committee execs and approves
 
05:14:13.670 --> 05:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
this bill i would really want to hear
 
05:14:14.628 --> 05:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:14:16.470 --> 05:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
folks in enforcement
 
05:14:17.590 --> 05:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
if that
 
05:14:19.830 --> 05:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
how big a change or shift that would be
 
05:14:22.628 --> 05:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
by inserting recklessly in there
 
05:14:22.638 --> 05:14:23.990 align:start position:0%
by inserting recklessly in there
um

05:14:23.990 --> 05:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:25.590 --> 05:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
because i know there are
 
05:14:27.270 --> 05:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
again as representative smith had
 
05:14:29.670 --> 05:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are different
 
05:14:31.910 --> 05:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
thresholds it also affects whether it's
 
05:14:34.390 --> 05:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
a civil versus a criminal penalty
 
05:14:34.400 --> 05:14:35.350 align:start position:0%
a civil versus a criminal penalty
and

05:14:35.350 --> 05:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:14:38.230 --> 05:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
i think it'd be
 
05:14:40.868 --> 05:14:40.878 align:start position:0%
wise to hear directly from the agency
 
05:14:42.708 --> 05:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
that enforces this
 
05:14:42.718 --> 05:14:43.670 align:start position:0%
that enforces this
uh

05:14:43.670 --> 05:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:14:46.150 --> 05:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
what the insertion of say recklessly
 
05:14:49.190 --> 05:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
would in fact do to this due to the bill
 
05:14:49.200 --> 05:14:50.150 align:start position:0%
would in fact do to this due to the bill
so

05:14:50.150 --> 05:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:14:53.350 --> 05:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
um having said that again i i come today
 
05:14:55.670 --> 05:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
before you and testify in support of
 
05:14:58.230 --> 05:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 193 as as it's drafted and
 
05:14:59.750 --> 05:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to try and answer any
 
05:14:59.760 --> 05:15:02.628 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to try and answer any
questions

05:15:02.628 --> 05:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:15:06.230 --> 05:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
is there any questions for uh mr stock
 
05:15:08.310 --> 05:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
there are no hands-on questions
 
05:15:08.320 --> 05:15:09.510 align:start position:0%
there are no hands-on questions
okay

05:15:09.510 --> 05:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:15:09.520 --> 05:15:13.830 align:start position:0%
okay
anybody

05:15:13.830 --> 05:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:15.910 --> 05:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
the chair has a question in your
 
05:15:15.920 --> 05:15:17.430 align:start position:0%
the chair has a question in your
testimony

05:15:17.430 --> 05:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:15:17.440 --> 05:15:18.628 align:start position:0%
testimony
uh

05:15:18.628 --> 05:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:15:22.310 --> 05:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
i think i heard you say that right now
 
05:15:22.320 --> 05:15:23.270 align:start position:0%
i think i heard you say that right now
it's

05:15:23.270 --> 05:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:15:28.390 --> 05:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
the usually that the only person that
 
05:15:31.270 --> 05:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
that the division of forests and lands
 
05:15:33.910 --> 05:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
goes after is the logger
 
05:15:36.310 --> 05:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
and this would allow them to go after
 
05:15:36.320 --> 05:15:37.190 align:start position:0%
and this would allow them to go after
the

05:15:37.190 --> 05:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:15:39.910 --> 05:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
the person behind the logger
 
05:15:42.390 --> 05:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:44.788 --> 05:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
when i spoke to the rangers about this
 
05:15:47.430 --> 05:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
and we had this discussion last year
 
05:15:49.510 --> 05:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
right now the way the law is written is
 
05:15:51.670 --> 05:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
the only person under a civil
 
05:15:53.670 --> 05:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
penalty they can pursue
 
05:15:56.150 --> 05:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
is that individual that cut fell
 
05:15:58.868 --> 05:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
destroyed injured or carried away
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
the tree
 
05:16:01.190 --> 05:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
in that
 
05:16:03.350 --> 05:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
in essence the logger
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
and there are instances and
 
05:16:08.150 --> 05:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances where the logger may not
 
05:16:11.590 --> 05:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
be the party that's rep that really is
 
05:16:13.990 --> 05:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for that tree
 
05:16:15.350 --> 05:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
being cut
 
05:16:18.150 --> 05:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
or carried away um it may in fact be the
 
05:16:20.948 --> 05:16:20.958 align:start position:0%
landowner that misrepresented it or the
 
05:16:20.958 --> 05:16:22.150 align:start position:0%
landowner that misrepresented it or the
forester

05:16:22.150 --> 05:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
forester
 
05:16:24.230 --> 05:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
that misrepresented the ownership to the
 
05:16:27.030 --> 05:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
logger and so this gives the division of
 
05:16:28.470 --> 05:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
forests and lands
 
05:16:31.350 --> 05:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
it allows them the flexibility to yes
 
05:16:33.830 --> 05:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
look at the logger but also in their
 
05:16:35.510 --> 05:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
investigation look at these other
 
05:16:37.030 --> 05:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
parties that are involved in that
 
05:16:37.040 --> 05:16:41.270 align:start position:0%
parties that are involved in that
transaction

05:16:41.270 --> 05:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:42.868 --> 05:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
got that
 
05:16:45.750 --> 05:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody any uh any qualm
 
05:16:48.310 --> 05:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:16:51.110 --> 05:16:51.120 align:start position:0%

05:16:51.120 --> 05:16:52.070 align:start position:0%

sure i'd be glad to just bear with me
 
05:19:35.910 --> 05:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
i've got um
 
05:19:38.470 --> 05:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
a very really weird echo on my computer
 
05:19:40.150 --> 05:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:19:40.160 --> 05:19:41.190 align:start position:0%
right now
um

05:19:41.190 --> 05:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:43.110 --> 05:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for allowing me to
 
05:19:45.670 --> 05:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
testify before the committee
 
05:19:47.750 --> 05:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
um i i think the discussion's been
 
05:19:49.430 --> 05:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
excellent if for those of you who've had
 
05:19:51.430 --> 05:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
a chance to review my testimony
 
05:19:53.030 --> 05:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
submitted earlier
 
05:19:53.040 --> 05:19:55.350 align:start position:0%
submitted earlier
yesterday

05:19:55.350 --> 05:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
05:19:57.430 --> 05:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
we are in support of the bill
 
05:19:59.590 --> 05:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
as proposed
 
05:20:02.230 --> 05:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
um i don't think the addition of the
 
05:20:06.070 --> 05:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
word recklessly to the bill would change
 
05:20:09.350 --> 05:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh the enforcement significantly
 
05:20:12.948 --> 05:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
our rangers currently look at all of the
 
05:20:14.788 --> 05:20:14.798 align:start position:0%
parties involved in a timber harvest
 
05:20:17.750 --> 05:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
when they're examining the evidence
 
05:20:20.948 --> 05:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
to determine how the trespass occurred
 
05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
so this the added language extends the
 
05:20:26.788 --> 05:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
culpability to the landowner
 
05:20:29.590 --> 05:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
if they were the causing effect of the
 
05:20:31.190 --> 05:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
timber trespass
 
05:20:32.390 --> 05:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
in other words if they provided
 
05:20:34.390 --> 05:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
erroneous maps or
 
05:20:36.230 --> 05:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
gave verbal instructions that clearly
 
05:20:37.270 --> 05:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
were not
 
05:20:37.280 --> 05:20:38.708 align:start position:0%
were not
accurate

05:20:38.708 --> 05:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
05:20:40.788 --> 05:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
this allows the rangers to
 
05:20:42.868 --> 05:20:42.878 align:start position:0%
move that investigation towards the
 
05:20:44.948 --> 05:20:44.958 align:start position:0%
landowner but they would do that under
 
05:20:47.190 --> 05:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
the current law anyway
 
05:20:50.708 --> 05:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
this this refinement of the language
 
05:20:52.948 --> 05:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
just formally extends that culpability
 
05:20:54.628 --> 05:20:54.638 align:start position:0%
to the landowner if
 
05:20:56.948 --> 05:20:56.958 align:start position:0%

representative

05:23:48.470 --> 05:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:23:53.430 --> 05:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:55.750 --> 05:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative harp
 
05:23:58.470 --> 05:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
miss thank you mr chair uh just as
 
05:24:01.190 --> 05:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
to address the issue of an amendment
 
05:24:02.948 --> 05:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
and the comments of some of the other
 
05:24:05.830 --> 05:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
speakers and presenters
 
05:24:08.310 --> 05:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
a simpler way to amend it would be
 
05:24:11.350 --> 05:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
simply to delete the for the or
 
05:24:13.990 --> 05:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
on the first door where it says or carry
 
05:24:17.430 --> 05:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
away if you just put comma carry away or
 
05:24:19.510 --> 05:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
cause to be cut you're not repeating
 
05:24:22.230 --> 05:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
either the negligent or the reckless but
 
05:24:25.110 --> 05:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
yeah it was just as strict construction
 
05:24:27.670 --> 05:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
with the calmer and or a second or
 
05:24:29.910 --> 05:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's what concerned me so i don't
 
05:24:32.868 --> 05:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
think we need to get involved if the
 
05:24:35.670 --> 05:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
representatives willing to amend uh to
 
05:24:37.910 --> 05:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
add another word again just delete the
 
05:24:41.590 --> 05:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
first or in either uh section in both
 
05:24:43.910 --> 05:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
sections and that would resolve that we
 
05:24:45.350 --> 05:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
don't have to get involved with what
 
05:24:47.670 --> 05:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
happens if you add another another word
 
05:24:50.150 --> 05:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
reckless or negligence thank you thank

05:58:13.590 --> 05:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sponsoring this bill hb 611 which is
 
05:58:16.590 --> 05:58:16.600 align:start position:0%
very similar to hb 192 from the
 
05:58:18.788 --> 05:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
2019-2020 session
 
05:58:20.310 --> 05:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
that bill passed out of committee with a
 
05:58:22.548 --> 05:58:22.558 align:start position:0%
16-3 bipartisan ought to pass
 
05:58:24.548 --> 05:58:24.558 align:start position:0%
recommendation and was placed on the
 
05:58:26.708 --> 05:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
consent calendar when it came to the
 
05:58:28.310 --> 05:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
floor the committee chair pulled it from
 
05:58:29.990 --> 05:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar and tabled it and
 
05:58:32.230 --> 05:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
it died on the table
 
05:58:33.750 --> 05:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sponsoring this bill because as a
 
05:58:35.510 --> 05:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
nurse informed consent is extremely
 
05:58:37.270 --> 05:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
important to me and i believe that
 
05:58:39.110 --> 05:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
public water fluoridation circumvents
 
05:58:41.750 --> 05:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
true informed consent for individuals
 
05:58:43.670 --> 05:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities must bring the issue to a
 
05:58:45.430 --> 05:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
vote in the town before a policy of
 
05:58:47.590 --> 05:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation is adopted but many
 
05:58:49.030 --> 05:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
people don't have time to partake in
 
05:58:50.628 --> 05:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
that process or are unaware that the
 
05:58:52.390 --> 05:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
question is on the table
 
05:58:53.990 --> 05:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
many people are unaware their tap water

town website or newspaper publishing
 
05:58:58.868 --> 05:58:58.878 align:start position:0%
that information
 
05:59:00.548 --> 05:59:00.558 align:start position:0%
the reality is that most people don't
 
05:59:00.558 --> 05:59:01.750 align:start position:0%
the reality is that most people don't
look

05:59:01.750 --> 05:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
look
 
05:59:03.110 --> 05:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
the last time that the question of
 
05:59:04.708 --> 05:59:04.718 align:start position:0%
adding fluoride to drinking water was
 
05:59:06.230 --> 05:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
brought to committee for a vote to
 
05:59:07.910 --> 05:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
communities for a vote was in the year

05:59:14.310 --> 05:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
fluoridation won by one percent in an
 
05:59:16.310 --> 05:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
election that had very low turnout
 
05:59:18.628 --> 05:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
essentially 15 000 people decided for
 
05:59:20.708 --> 05:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
150 000 people
 
05:59:22.470 --> 05:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
the dental lobby had spent tens of
 
05:59:24.628 --> 05:59:24.638 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars on ads and mailers
 
05:59:25.990 --> 05:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
according to their own internal
 
05:59:28.230 --> 05:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
documents and had a former us surgeon
 
05:59:30.470 --> 05:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
general as their key spokesperson
 
05:59:31.750 --> 05:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's what pushed them over the edge
 
05:59:33.510 --> 05:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
for the close win there
 
05:59:34.948 --> 05:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
while there is a demonstrated benefit
 
05:59:36.470 --> 05:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
from the use of topical fluoride in
 
05:59:38.708 --> 05:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
preventing dental decay
 
05:59:40.310 --> 05:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
and limited demonstrated benefit from
 
05:59:41.990 --> 05:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
ingesting fluoride and water
 
05:59:43.590 --> 05:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
there is a substantial amount of
 
05:59:45.990 --> 05:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
evidence that ingesting fluoride can be
 
05:59:48.230 --> 05:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
extremely harmful especially to fetuses
 
05:59:50.868 --> 05:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
infants and children in new hampshire in
 
05:59:53.030 --> 05:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
2008 fluoride systems were installed in
 
05:59:55.030 --> 05:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
some schools and after four years of
 
05:59:56.868 --> 05:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation in these schools the
 
05:59:58.548 --> 05:59:58.558 align:start position:0%
union leader reported that tooth decay
 
06:00:00.150 --> 06:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
continued to rise
 
06:00:01.830 --> 06:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
only after the state introduced dental
 
06:00:03.110 --> 06:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
clinics in schools that provided
 
06:00:05.110 --> 06:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
screenings cleanings and sealants to
 
06:00:07.270 --> 06:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
decay rates decrease
 
06:00:09.350 --> 06:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
as far as harm dental fluorosis is
 
06:00:11.350 --> 06:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
internationally recognized as a visible
 
06:00:13.270 --> 06:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
sign of systemic toxicity caused by
 
06:00:13.280 --> 06:00:14.310 align:start position:0%
sign of systemic toxicity caused by
fluoride

06:00:14.310 --> 06:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
fluoride
 
06:00:16.310 --> 06:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
it indicates improper mineralization
 
06:00:17.910 --> 06:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
leading to staining and weakening of the
 
06:00:17.920 --> 06:00:19.190 align:start position:0%
leading to staining and weakening of the
enamel

06:00:19.190 --> 06:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
enamel
 
06:00:21.910 --> 06:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
in 2014 the cdc reported that the rate
 
06:00:23.910 --> 06:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
of dental fluorosis had increased over
 
06:00:26.070 --> 06:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
400 percent from the rates found a
 
06:00:27.750 --> 06:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
decade after the widespread start of
 
06:00:29.990 --> 06:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
fluoridation in the 1950s
 
06:00:32.548 --> 06:00:32.558 align:start position:0%
in 2019 the cdc published updated data
 
06:00:35.190 --> 06:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
showing that 65 of adolescents now had
 
06:00:37.110 --> 06:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
dental fluorosis
 
06:00:38.948 --> 06:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
this was a 60 increase from the
 
06:00:41.110 --> 06:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
fluorosis rates reported by the cdc when
 
06:00:42.628 --> 06:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire legislature passed the
 
06:00:44.708 --> 06:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
florida fluoridation warning bill into
 
06:00:46.548 --> 06:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
law to protect infants
 
06:00:48.390 --> 06:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
that bill required warnings to be sent
 
06:00:50.070 --> 06:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
to residents of towns with fluoridated
 
06:00:52.150 --> 06:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
water to not use it to reconstitute
 
06:00:53.910 --> 06:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
infant formula
 
06:00:55.910 --> 06:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
on a personal note my own son has severe
 
06:00:57.190 --> 06:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
dental fluorosis from drinking
 
06:00:58.830 --> 06:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
fluoridated tap water when we lived in
 
06:01:00.548 --> 06:01:00.558 align:start position:0%
massachusetts i didn't even know our
 
06:01:02.470 --> 06:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
water was fluoridated until his dentist
 
06:01:04.548 --> 06:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
explained to me why he had staining on
 
06:01:06.310 --> 06:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
his teeth
 
06:01:07.910 --> 06:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
other studies have shown a relationship
 
06:01:09.990 --> 06:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
between ingesting fluoridated water and
 
06:01:13.030 --> 06:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
increased rates of add hypothyroidism
 
06:01:15.510 --> 06:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
osteoporosis and neurological problems
 
06:01:18.150 --> 06:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
including decreased iq
 
06:01:19.910 --> 06:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
dosage for individuals is nearly
 
06:01:21.910 --> 06:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
impossible to regulate as it is based on
 
06:01:24.390 --> 06:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
intake the therapeutic window between
 
06:01:26.070 --> 06:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
the lowest effective dose and toxic
 
06:01:29.110 --> 06:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
level is very narrow in 2014 the upper
 
06:01:32.788 --> 06:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
limit was reduced by 40 percent from 1.2
 
06:01:35.190 --> 06:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
to 0.7 parts per million by the us
 
06:01:37.190 --> 06:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
06:01:39.510 --> 06:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
after cdc data showed overexposure in
 
06:01:41.750 --> 06:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
fluoridated communities
 
06:01:43.910 --> 06:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of possible harm or benefit
 
06:01:45.750 --> 06:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation is the only instance
 
06:01:47.750 --> 06:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
in society in which medication is forced
 
06:01:50.390 --> 06:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
on individuals by majority rule and now
 
06:01:52.548 --> 06:01:52.558 align:start position:0%
in some cases without even requiring a
 
06:01:55.430 --> 06:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
vote in 2019 a non-german amendment was
 
06:01:57.110 --> 06:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
made to change the water fluoridation
 
06:01:59.430 --> 06:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
law to allow towns receiving water from
 
06:02:01.830 --> 06:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
towns and cities that floridate to only
 
06:02:03.750 --> 06:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
notify residents prior to introducing
 
06:02:07.270 --> 06:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
the water and no vote was needed
 
06:02:09.590 --> 06:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
06:02:11.590 --> 06:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
most toothpastes are fluoridated there
 
06:02:13.510 --> 06:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
are fluoride mouth rinses
 
06:02:15.190 --> 06:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
fluoride tablets are available and
 
06:02:16.948 --> 06:02:16.958 align:start position:0%
therefore affordable
 
06:02:18.310 --> 06:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
dentists routinely give fluoride
 
06:02:20.470 --> 06:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
treatments at semi-annual visits
 
06:02:22.230 --> 06:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
these are all ways to ensure adequate
 
06:02:24.310 --> 06:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
fluoride supplementation with proper
 
06:02:25.830 --> 06:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
informed consent
 
06:02:27.948 --> 06:02:27.958 align:start position:0%
and with less risk less risk of
 
06:02:27.958 --> 06:02:29.750 align:start position:0%
and with less risk less risk of
fluorotoxicity

06:02:29.750 --> 06:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
fluorotoxicity
 
06:02:31.510 --> 06:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
those who do not want fluoridated water
 
06:02:33.190 --> 06:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
in these fluoridated communities must
 
06:02:34.948 --> 06:02:34.958 align:start position:0%
buy expensive filtration systems to
 
06:02:37.030 --> 06:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
remove fluoride or else buy bottled
 
06:02:38.868 --> 06:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
water that isn't fluoridated or seek out
 
06:02:40.150 --> 06:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
spring water
 
06:02:43.430 --> 06:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
they pay taxes for for water treatment
 
06:02:45.350 --> 06:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
and then they receive water that they
 
06:02:47.990 --> 06:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
can't use or don't want to use and then
 
06:02:49.270 --> 06:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
on top of that they have to buy
 
06:02:51.670 --> 06:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
filtration equipment or bottled water
 
06:02:53.350 --> 06:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
the decision to have fluoride in water
 
06:02:55.270 --> 06:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
should be an individual decision with
 
06:02:57.830 --> 06:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
proper informed consent not a community
 
06:02:59.990 --> 06:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
decision that's why this practice needs
 
06:03:02.070 --> 06:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
to be abolished in new hampshire i think
 
06:03:03.830 --> 06:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
i thank you mr chairman and members of
 
06:03:05.350 --> 06:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
the committee for your time please
 
06:03:07.750 --> 06:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
support hb 611 with a vote of ought to
 
06:03:07.760 --> 06:03:11.830 align:start position:0%
support hb 611 with a vote of ought to
pass

06:03:11.830 --> 06:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:13.990 --> 06:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
06:03:16.948 --> 06:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
representative gunski i have a question
 
06:03:18.548 --> 06:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
representative this is representative
 
06:03:21.190 --> 06:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
mike gunski
 
06:03:25.030 --> 06:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:37.670 --> 06:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:40.150 --> 06:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
i think the um the
 
06:03:41.990 --> 06:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
meeting room is muted i can't hear
 
06:03:42.000 --> 06:03:47.510 align:start position:0%
meeting room is muted i can't hear
anything

06:03:47.510 --> 06:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:49.190 --> 06:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
that has been happening during the day
 
06:03:49.200 --> 06:03:53.270 align:start position:0%
that has been happening during the day
today

06:03:53.270 --> 06:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:01.990 --> 06:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:03.830 --> 06:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
all right you're good okay can you hear
 
06:04:05.750 --> 06:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
me yes i can
 
06:04:09.190 --> 06:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
we had a small technical issue sorry
 
06:04:11.430 --> 06:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative i wanted to ask you
 
06:04:13.590 --> 06:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
had have you taken some time to look at
 
06:04:15.750 --> 06:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note on this bill
 
06:04:17.030 --> 06:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
i have
 
06:04:19.590 --> 06:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
could you comment on
 
06:04:21.590 --> 06:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
on the second page of the fiscal note it
 
06:04:23.750 --> 06:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
gives us some figures
 
06:04:25.910 --> 06:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
there's five bullet points and it talks
 
06:04:30.470 --> 06:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:31.990 --> 06:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
with your medical background you could
 
06:04:34.310 --> 06:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
probably answer better than i could i
 
06:04:36.788 --> 06:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
is is the fluoride supplementation is
 
06:04:39.990 --> 06:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
that something that's fairly common
 
06:04:41.270 --> 06:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
because there this is a pretty
 
06:04:42.788 --> 06:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
significant fiscal note that they're
 
06:04:44.788 --> 06:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
showing here although it's mostly
 
06:04:46.230 --> 06:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
assumptions so i was wondering if you
 
06:04:47.830 --> 06:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
could give me some clarification and
 
06:04:50.230 --> 06:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
your views on that
 
06:04:50.240 --> 06:04:51.110 align:start position:0%
your views on that
um

06:04:51.110 --> 06:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:54.868 --> 06:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
yeah i i see this as all assumption i

as far as i know
 
06:04:56.638 --> 06:04:57.670 align:start position:0%
as far as i know
um

06:04:57.670 --> 06:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:00.230 --> 06:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
fluoride supplements are relatively
 
06:05:00.240 --> 06:05:01.670 align:start position:0%
fluoride supplements are relatively
inexpensive

06:05:01.670 --> 06:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
inexpensive
 
06:05:03.110 --> 06:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
and because
 
06:05:06.788 --> 06:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation is only minimally
 
06:05:09.270 --> 06:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
impactful in in controlling and
 
06:05:11.830 --> 06:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
decreasing tooth decay i don't really
 
06:05:13.030 --> 06:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
see that
 
06:05:16.150 --> 06:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
you know more ingestion is is warranted
 
06:05:19.590 --> 06:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:21.350 --> 06:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
topical treatments
 
06:05:23.430 --> 06:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
have the most impact and i don't really
 
06:05:25.670 --> 06:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
see that there's going to be such a need
 
06:05:25.680 --> 06:05:26.628 align:start position:0%
see that there's going to be such a need
for

the practice of water fluoridation
 
06:07:58.390 --> 06:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
prevents tooth decay for children and

adults by an estimated 25 percent
 
06:08:03.750 --> 06:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
data collected from fluoridated systems
 
06:08:05.910 --> 06:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire show that the annual
 
06:08:07.910 --> 06:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
cost of community water fluoridation
 
06:08:11.510 --> 06:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
ranges from 27 cents to 3.05 cents per
 
06:08:14.070 --> 06:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
person per year depending on the size of
 
06:08:15.910 --> 06:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
the community
 
06:08:17.750 --> 06:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
multiple studies have been conducted to
 
06:08:19.430 --> 06:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
estimate the economic impact of
 
06:08:21.510 --> 06:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
community water fluoridation
 
06:08:23.590 --> 06:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
while methodology has varied results
 
06:08:24.948 --> 06:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
have consistently pointed to
 
06:08:26.868 --> 06:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
fluoridation as a health-based strategy
 
06:08:28.788 --> 06:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
that results in cost savings for both
 
06:08:31.430 --> 06:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
individuals and for communities
 
06:08:33.590 --> 06:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
one such analysis showed a return on
 
06:08:35.590 --> 06:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
investment of twenty dollars for every
 
06:08:37.990 --> 06:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
dollar invested by communities and an
 
06:08:39.830 --> 06:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
average savings of thirty two dollars
 
06:08:41.750 --> 06:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
per person by avoiding the need for
 
06:08:44.150 --> 06:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
treatment for dental decay
 
06:08:45.830 --> 06:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
cost savings come not only from the
 
06:08:48.470 --> 06:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
avoidance of direct cost of dental care
 
06:08:50.628 --> 06:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
but also the indirect cost of missed
 
06:08:52.628 --> 06:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
work or miss schooling due to dental
 
06:08:55.190 --> 06:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
pain or for the receipt of dental care
 
06:08:56.708 --> 06:08:56.718 align:start position:0%
at a time when state and local

governments are facing tremendous fiscal
 
06:09:01.030 --> 06:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
pressure the public can feel confident
 
06:09:03.030 --> 06:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
that community water fluoridation is one
 
06:09:05.110 --> 06:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
example of a program that truly saves

health effects for systemic disorders
 
06:09:16.708 --> 06:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
this was true even in the past when the
 
06:09:18.708 --> 06:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
recommendation included levels exceeding

services task force in 2013 the cdc
 
06:09:29.590 --> 06:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
updated the fluoridation recommendation
 
06:09:32.230 --> 06:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
to establish 0.7 milligrams of fluoride
 
06:09:34.470 --> 06:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
per liter of drinking water as the
 
06:09:36.548 --> 06:09:36.558 align:start position:0%
optimum concentration needed to achieve
 
06:09:39.510 --> 06:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
dental benefit to ensure compliance with
 
06:09:41.670 --> 06:09:41.680 align:start position:0%

of that recommended level
 
06:10:15.430 --> 06:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
given the close monitoring that occurs
 
06:10:17.430 --> 06:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
with fluoridation we can be assured that
 
06:10:19.190 --> 06:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
this has not happened and will not
 
06:10:21.510 --> 06:10:21.520 align:start position:0%

06:10:46.230 --> 06:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:49.910 --> 06:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any questions
 
06:10:57.670 --> 06:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:00.708 --> 06:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:03.590 --> 06:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman um
 
06:11:06.070 --> 06:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
my question would be um who provides the
 
06:11:06.080 --> 06:11:07.190 align:start position:0%
my question would be um who provides the
fluoride

06:11:07.190 --> 06:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
fluoride
 
06:11:09.430 --> 06:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh to the state that's um put into our
 
06:11:13.190 --> 06:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:14.868 --> 06:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna ask if there's someone from
 
06:11:16.868 --> 06:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services who
 
06:11:19.750 --> 06:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
might be able to speak to that um it i
 
06:11:22.150 --> 06:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's centralized i think
 
06:11:25.190 --> 06:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
water systems purchase their supplies um
 
06:11:27.510 --> 06:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
from different vendors
 
06:11:30.628 --> 06:11:30.638 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up question mr chairman uh for
 
06:11:31.910 --> 06:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
06:11:33.590 --> 06:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh do you know if the public health
 
06:11:36.868 --> 06:11:36.878 align:start position:0%
regions or dhhs provides um
 
06:11:38.628 --> 06:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
education or partners with local
 
06:11:40.390 --> 06:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
dentists to educate their patients
 
06:11:41.910 --> 06:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
regarding fluoride and that they're
 
06:11:43.430 --> 06:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
drinking their water
 
06:11:46.868 --> 06:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:49.030 --> 06:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
so we do work with the dental community
 
06:11:52.548 --> 06:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
to offer trainings on water fluoridation
 
06:11:55.110 --> 06:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
and also with with water systems provide
 
06:11:57.270 --> 06:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
training to drinking water operators on
 
06:11:57.280 --> 06:11:58.390 align:start position:0%
training to drinking water operators on
fluoridation

06:11:58.390 --> 06:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
fluoridation
 
06:12:00.070 --> 06:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
and we partner we've partnered in the
 
06:12:03.190 --> 06:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
past with our oral health coalition um
 
06:12:05.270 --> 06:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
our dental society and also with our
 
06:12:06.948 --> 06:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services on
 
06:12:08.868 --> 06:12:08.878 align:start position:0%
those trainings
 
06:12:11.510 --> 06:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up question mr chairman
 
06:12:12.948 --> 06:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
or follow-up
 
06:12:15.670 --> 06:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
are those trainings designed directly to
 
06:12:17.270 --> 06:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
the patients in the
 
06:12:21.670 --> 06:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:24.390 --> 06:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
um so trainings that i have participated
 
06:12:26.948 --> 06:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
in have been for
 
06:12:29.910 --> 06:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
for health providers public health
 
06:12:29.920 --> 06:12:31.350 align:start position:0%
for health providers public health
professionals

06:12:31.350 --> 06:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
06:12:33.750 --> 06:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
and also members of the the drinking
 
06:12:37.910 --> 06:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
water community but we do um
 
06:12:40.390 --> 06:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
we do provide education to the community
 
06:12:43.270 --> 06:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
as well not necessarily in the form of
 
06:12:45.350 --> 06:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
trainings but through educational
 
06:12:46.868 --> 06:12:46.878 align:start position:0%
materials and we're available to respond
 
06:12:50.390 --> 06:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:54.150 --> 06:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up question mr sherman
 
06:12:54.160 --> 06:12:54.868 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up question mr sherman
up

06:12:54.868 --> 06:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
up
 
06:12:57.350 --> 06:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
where would uh members of the community
 
06:13:00.070 --> 06:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
access materials uh
 
06:13:02.070 --> 06:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
other than you know online at the dhh
 
06:13:04.150 --> 06:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
website if they want to learn more about
 
06:13:07.030 --> 06:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
what's in their drinking water
 
06:13:08.868 --> 06:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
if people wanted to learn specifically
 
06:13:11.030 --> 06:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
about what's in their drinking water um
 
06:13:12.628 --> 06:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
i mean drinking water systems put out
 
06:13:14.230 --> 06:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
consumer confidence reports which
 
06:13:16.548 --> 06:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
includes details about about this the
 
06:13:19.030 --> 06:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
water and the specific system if people
 
06:13:21.190 --> 06:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
want to learn more about community water
 
06:13:23.830 --> 06:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
fluoridation there are some great sites
 
06:13:25.510 --> 06:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
including one put out by the american
 
06:13:27.670 --> 06:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
academy academy of pediatrics called
 
06:13:27.680 --> 06:13:30.230 align:start position:0%
academy academy of pediatrics called
ilikemyteeth.org

06:13:30.230 --> 06:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
ilikemyteeth.org
 
06:13:32.628 --> 06:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
and we could certainly direct people to
 
06:13:35.590 --> 06:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
a number of different resources
 
06:13:36.948 --> 06:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:13:39.910 --> 06:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:41.750 --> 06:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh okay uh
 
06:13:41.760 --> 06:13:48.070 align:start position:0%
uh okay uh
representative

06:13:48.070 --> 06:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:50.868 --> 06:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
sorry was that for me yes representative
 
06:13:53.190 --> 06:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
kelly for a question
 
06:13:55.430 --> 06:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes ms craver uh we heard previous
 
06:13:57.510 --> 06:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
testimony that there was little evidence
 
06:14:00.868 --> 06:14:00.878 align:start position:0%
of uh ingestible fluorite fluoride
 
06:14:02.310 --> 06:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
having an effect
 
06:14:06.708 --> 06:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:06.718 --> 06:14:08.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:14:08.310 --> 06:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:10.470 --> 06:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
having a a health benefit so there i
 
06:14:13.190 --> 06:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
mean there are there are benefits both
 
06:14:16.230 --> 06:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
topically and systemically and so that's
 
06:14:17.750 --> 06:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
why we support community water
 
06:14:19.670 --> 06:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
fluoridation which actually acts in both
 
06:14:21.270 --> 06:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
ways you know there's the ingestion of
 
06:14:23.590 --> 06:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
fluoride but also the contact with
 
06:14:25.030 --> 06:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
people's teeth throughout the day as
 
06:14:27.430 --> 06:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
they drink water and both are beneficial
 
06:14:33.270 --> 06:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:36.708 --> 06:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:36.718 --> 06:14:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:14:37.750 --> 06:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:14:41.110 --> 06:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh any uh other question uh it's uh
 
06:14:42.868 --> 06:14:42.878 align:start position:0%
representative gunski good question
 
06:14:45.030 --> 06:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
06:14:46.470 --> 06:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh miss craper
 
06:14:48.310 --> 06:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
what does your department or how does
 
06:14:51.430 --> 06:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
your department identify the additive in
 
06:14:53.990 --> 06:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
the water that fluoride attitude is do
 
06:14:55.670 --> 06:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
you consider that a medicine what do you
 
06:15:02.230 --> 06:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:03.670 --> 06:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i'm understanding the
 
06:15:06.390 --> 06:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
question i mean it's it's a
 
06:15:08.230 --> 06:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
we recognize it as a public health
 
06:15:09.590 --> 06:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
practice to
 
06:15:14.548 --> 06:15:14.558 align:start position:0%
to add fluoride to drinking water
 
06:15:14.558 --> 06:15:15.430 align:start position:0%
to add fluoride to drinking water
okay

06:15:15.430 --> 06:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:15:15.440 --> 06:15:16.868 align:start position:0%
okay
so

06:15:16.868 --> 06:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:15:19.110 --> 06:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
so it's just that you you consider it
 
06:15:21.990 --> 06:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:24.628 --> 06:15:24.638 align:start position:0%
it's part of the water treatment process
 
06:15:26.628 --> 06:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
that provides a health benefit
 
06:15:26.638 --> 06:15:28.868 align:start position:0%
that provides a health benefit
okay

06:15:28.868 --> 06:15:28.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:15:30.470 --> 06:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:15:32.628 --> 06:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
representative craig
 
06:15:35.270 --> 06:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes ma'am uh miss kramer just
 
06:15:38.070 --> 06:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
we just heard testimony um that
 
06:15:40.070 --> 06:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
fluoride was directly attributable to
 
06:15:42.628 --> 06:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
abd hyperthyroidism
 
06:15:44.470 --> 06:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
lower iq
 
06:15:46.470 --> 06:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
and other issues
 
06:15:47.990 --> 06:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
how would you respond to those
 
06:15:48.000 --> 06:15:49.430 align:start position:0%
how would you respond to those
assertions

06:15:49.430 --> 06:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
assertions
 
06:15:52.390 --> 06:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
that were just made in this hearing
 
06:15:53.990 --> 06:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
i would stand by the statement in my
 
06:15:55.750 --> 06:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that there hasn't been sound
 
06:15:57.670 --> 06:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence supporting those
 
06:15:57.680 --> 06:16:05.030 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence supporting those
findings

06:16:05.030 --> 06:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:07.190 --> 06:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
06:16:07.200 --> 06:16:10.070 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

06:16:10.070 --> 06:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:16:12.948 --> 06:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
i have a question uh do you
 
06:16:15.190 --> 06:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
you've uh find uh
 
06:16:20.708 --> 06:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:23.030 --> 06:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
no no scientific background
 
06:16:25.510 --> 06:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
scientific basis
 
06:16:28.070 --> 06:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
um so at the at the level for
 
06:16:31.350 --> 06:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
optimization 0.7 milligrams per liter i
 
06:16:34.150 --> 06:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
would not expect to see fluorosis at
 
06:16:36.948 --> 06:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
you know possibly at higher levels
 
06:16:39.110 --> 06:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
but community water fluoridation the
 
06:16:41.830 --> 06:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
practice of community water fluoridation
 
06:16:43.990 --> 06:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
is closely monitored
 
06:16:45.990 --> 06:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
so that water systems are achieving that
 
06:16:48.150 --> 06:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
optimized level
 
06:16:50.788 --> 06:16:50.798 align:start position:0%
and and i would say you know the the
 
06:16:52.788 --> 06:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
environmental protection agency that
 
06:16:54.390 --> 06:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
sets a
 
06:16:56.628 --> 06:16:56.638 align:start position:0%
max contaminant level at which there may
 
06:16:59.030 --> 06:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
be health effects which i said is 5.7
 
06:17:01.430 --> 06:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
times higher or more than 5.7 times
 
06:17:03.750 --> 06:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
higher than that optimization level
 
06:17:06.708 --> 06:17:06.718 align:start position:0%
in the the secondary max contaminant
 
06:17:08.470 --> 06:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
level which is set for some constituents
 
06:17:10.708 --> 06:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
including fluoride where there may be an
 
06:17:13.510 --> 06:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
impact on odor taste color and in the
 
06:17:16.230 --> 06:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
case of fluoride potential um cosmetic
 
06:17:19.030 --> 06:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
impacts is two two milligrams per liter
 
06:17:20.948 --> 06:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
so again the level for optimization is
 
06:17:23.510 --> 06:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
0.7 milligrams per liter
 
06:17:25.510 --> 06:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
and that is a target that is achieved by
 
06:17:29.430 --> 06:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:31.110 --> 06:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
06:17:31.120 --> 06:17:32.628 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

06:17:32.628 --> 06:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:17:39.510 --> 06:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:45.430 --> 06:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:46.948 --> 06:17:46.958 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you
 
06:17:48.628 --> 06:17:48.638 align:start position:0%
are you aware of areas in the state of
 
06:17:50.548 --> 06:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire where the natural ground
 
06:17:52.470 --> 06:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
water may have higher levels of fluoride
 
06:17:54.788 --> 06:17:54.798 align:start position:0%
than is what is allowed in our uh
 
06:17:56.310 --> 06:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
regular drinking water public drinking
 
06:17:58.470 --> 06:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
water systems
 
06:18:00.628 --> 06:18:00.638 align:start position:0%
that's a question that i would differ
 
06:18:02.230 --> 06:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
to our partners from the department of
 
06:18:05.670 --> 06:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
environmental services to speak to
 
06:18:07.430 --> 06:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
is fluoride naturally occurring in the
 
06:18:07.440 --> 06:18:08.708 align:start position:0%
is fluoride naturally occurring in the
groundwater

06:18:08.708 --> 06:18:08.718 align:start position:0%
groundwater
 
06:18:10.948 --> 06:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
yes yes fluoride is naturally occurring
 
06:18:12.628 --> 06:18:12.638 align:start position:0%
in the groundwater
 
06:18:16.708 --> 06:18:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:19.350 --> 06:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
did i see representative gold wave or
 
06:18:19.360 --> 06:18:20.230 align:start position:0%
did i see representative gold wave or
yes

06:18:20.230 --> 06:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:18:21.990 --> 06:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
06:18:24.628 --> 06:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
the answer that you gave to uh
 
06:18:26.548 --> 06:18:26.558 align:start position:0%
chairman renzolo's question
 
06:18:28.788 --> 06:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
was a little more scientific that i
 
06:18:30.470 --> 06:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
could understand do you think you could
 
06:18:33.190 --> 06:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
put it in more layman's term for me
 
06:18:35.510 --> 06:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
can can you remind me which question
 
06:18:37.110 --> 06:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
that was sorry
 
06:18:38.708 --> 06:18:38.718 align:start position:0%
you'll have to repeat it i think about
 
06:18:38.718 --> 06:18:42.470 align:start position:0%
you'll have to repeat it i think about
fluorosis

06:18:42.470 --> 06:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:44.628 --> 06:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
oh about the levels at which you might
 
06:18:47.430 --> 06:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
expect to see fluorosis
 
06:18:47.440 --> 06:18:48.628 align:start position:0%
expect to see fluorosis
so

06:18:48.628 --> 06:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:18:51.430 --> 06:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
so just just to very broadly summarize i
 
06:18:54.070 --> 06:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
would not expect to see um fluorosis at
 
06:18:56.310 --> 06:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
the levels of fluoride
 
06:18:58.390 --> 06:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
um which you would see with community
 
06:19:00.230 --> 06:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation so where water
 
06:19:03.110 --> 06:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
systems are actively partic uh
 
06:19:05.590 --> 06:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
fluoridating their water
 
06:19:07.910 --> 06:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
you um
 
06:19:07.920 --> 06:19:08.868 align:start position:0%
you um
the

06:19:08.868 --> 06:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:19:10.948 --> 06:19:10.958 align:start position:0%
environmental protection agency has said
 
06:19:13.750 --> 06:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
that you may see fluorosis at two
 
06:19:15.510 --> 06:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
milligrams per liter which is more than
 
06:19:17.430 --> 06:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
twice the level that water systems
 
06:19:19.030 --> 06:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
fluoridate at
 
06:19:19.040 --> 06:19:19.830 align:start position:0%
fluoridate at
um

06:19:19.830 --> 06:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:21.590 --> 06:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
and as someone pointed out before
 
06:19:23.350 --> 06:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
fluorite is naturally occurring in the
 
06:19:25.270 --> 06:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
ground water and you and you could see
 
06:19:27.590 --> 06:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
that naturally occurring fluoride in
 
06:19:29.670 --> 06:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
your own home well or
 
06:19:29.680 --> 06:19:31.030 align:start position:0%
your own home well or
um

06:19:31.030 --> 06:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:33.510 --> 06:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
in a small system served by a well but
 
06:19:36.628 --> 06:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
you would not see levels like that
 
06:19:39.990 --> 06:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
with community water fluoridation
 
06:19:41.990 --> 06:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
that helpful
 
06:19:43.590 --> 06:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up
 
06:19:43.600 --> 06:19:44.470 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up
sure

06:19:44.470 --> 06:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
sure
 
06:19:48.070 --> 06:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:51.990 --> 06:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay well does fluorescence occur in uh
 
06:19:54.070 --> 06:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
the rest of the state and all the uh
 
06:19:56.390 --> 06:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
little towns in new hampshire earth
 
06:19:59.750 --> 06:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:02.548 --> 06:20:02.558 align:start position:0%
i've been i mean i it's not something
 
06:20:04.868 --> 06:20:04.878 align:start position:0%
that has been reported to me in my six
 
06:20:06.390 --> 06:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
years with the
 
06:20:15.750 --> 06:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:18.868 --> 06:20:18.878 align:start position:0%
was that that's your quest that uh
 
06:20:21.830 --> 06:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
your answer to your question the
 
06:20:21.840 --> 06:20:24.470 align:start position:0%
your answer to your question the
gold

06:20:24.470 --> 06:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:27.190 --> 06:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you that's fine thank you
 
06:20:27.200 --> 06:20:29.830 align:start position:0%
thank you that's fine thank you
thanks

06:20:29.830 --> 06:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:32.628 --> 06:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
representative for the first time
 
06:20:34.310 --> 06:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:20:37.830 --> 06:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
i have a question about why it is that
 
06:20:40.070 --> 06:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
06:20:42.310 --> 06:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
canada seems to be
 
06:20:45.190 --> 06:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
banning florida fluoridation of public
 
06:20:45.200 --> 06:20:46.230 align:start position:0%
banning florida fluoridation of public

06:20:46.230 --> 06:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
waters
 
06:20:46.240 --> 06:20:48.708 align:start position:0%
waters
when

06:20:48.708 --> 06:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:53.590 --> 06:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:53.600 --> 06:20:54.868 align:start position:0%
 
i

06:20:54.868 --> 06:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:20:57.190 --> 06:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
um i mean i'm not positioned to speak
 
06:20:58.948 --> 06:20:58.958 align:start position:0%
about decisions being made by other
 
06:21:01.670 --> 06:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
government agencies
 
06:21:04.070 --> 06:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
i can speak to our own agency's support
 
06:21:05.990 --> 06:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the practice of water fluoridation
 
06:21:08.230 --> 06:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
for the reasons stated in my testimony
 
06:21:10.868 --> 06:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
but i wouldn't want to
 
06:21:11.990 --> 06:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
want to guess as to why other
 
06:21:13.110 --> 06:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
governments are making different
 
06:21:13.120 --> 06:21:14.230 align:start position:0%
governments are making different
decisions

06:21:14.230 --> 06:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
06:21:15.430 --> 06:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:21:19.030 --> 06:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:19.040 --> 06:21:20.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:21:20.070 --> 06:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:21:22.548 --> 06:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
representative moran for the first time
 
06:21:26.628 --> 06:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:26.638 --> 06:21:27.350 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:21:27.350 --> 06:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:21:30.788 --> 06:21:30.798 align:start position:0%
thank you uh can you describe to me or
 
06:21:32.390 --> 06:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
provide an example
 
06:21:34.310 --> 06:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
of any other
 
06:21:34.320 --> 06:21:35.350 align:start position:0%
of any other
mineral

06:21:35.350 --> 06:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
mineral
 
06:21:35.360 --> 06:21:36.788 align:start position:0%
mineral
additive

06:21:36.788 --> 06:21:36.798 align:start position:0%
additive
 
06:21:38.470 --> 06:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
supplement or drug
 
06:21:40.788 --> 06:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
that is provided to the community in
 
06:21:48.230 --> 06:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:48.240 --> 06:21:49.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:21:49.190 --> 06:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:50.628 --> 06:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm just trying i'm trying to
 
06:21:53.670 --> 06:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
think you know my my scope at the health
 
06:21:56.310 --> 06:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
department is is narrowly to support the
 
06:21:58.830 --> 06:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
oral health program
 
06:22:05.750 --> 06:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:07.910 --> 06:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that
 
06:22:10.070 --> 06:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
i can understand that mr chairman can i
 
06:22:13.990 --> 06:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:17.110 --> 06:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
regards to the dental oral health uh is
 
06:22:19.110 --> 06:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
there a benefit for adults in new
 
06:22:21.910 --> 06:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire for dental services uh who for
 
06:22:21.920 --> 06:22:25.670 align:start position:0%
hampshire for dental services uh who for
medicaid

06:22:25.670 --> 06:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:27.590 --> 06:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm not sure understanding your
 
06:22:29.990 --> 06:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
question and it may be that our medicaid
 
06:22:31.910 --> 06:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
dental director will be speaking later
 
06:22:33.750 --> 06:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
she may be more poised to answer this
 
06:22:36.150 --> 06:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
question uh water fluoridation does
 
06:22:38.470 --> 06:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
benefit both children and adults
 
06:22:41.110 --> 06:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
yeah um my i guess my question would be
 
06:22:41.120 --> 06:22:42.548 align:start position:0%
yeah um my i guess my question would be
um

06:22:42.548 --> 06:22:42.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:42.558 --> 06:22:43.430 align:start position:0%
um
if

06:22:43.430 --> 06:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:22:45.510 --> 06:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
our clarification yeah can i ask a
 
06:22:48.150 --> 06:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
clarification clarifying question
 
06:22:48.160 --> 06:22:48.948 align:start position:0%
clarification clarifying question
sure

06:22:48.948 --> 06:22:48.958 align:start position:0%
sure
 
06:22:48.958 --> 06:22:49.990 align:start position:0%
sure
so

06:22:49.990 --> 06:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:22:51.830 --> 06:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman is that all right
 
06:22:51.840 --> 06:22:53.830 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman is that all right
yes

06:22:53.830 --> 06:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:22:55.510 --> 06:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
so i understand that in new hampshire
 
06:22:57.350 --> 06:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
children have a dental benefit for if
 
06:22:58.948 --> 06:22:58.958 align:start position:0%
when they are low income and qualified
 
06:23:00.390 --> 06:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
for medicaid
 
06:23:02.948 --> 06:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
and i understand that fluoride
 
06:23:04.708 --> 06:23:04.718 align:start position:0%
can be beneficial for
 
06:23:06.150 --> 06:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
healthy teeth
 
06:23:07.910 --> 06:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
06:23:09.430 --> 06:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
for low-income individuals throughout
 
06:23:11.190 --> 06:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
06:23:11.200 --> 06:23:12.390 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
um

06:23:12.390 --> 06:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:14.548 --> 06:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
who are in adults do they have access to
 
06:23:16.390 --> 06:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
a medicaid benefit
 
06:23:17.990 --> 06:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
so they can access fluoride treatments
 
06:23:20.948 --> 06:23:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:23.190 --> 06:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
the medi i'll let the our medicaid
 
06:23:25.350 --> 06:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
dental director speak to this when when
 
06:23:28.390 --> 06:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
she speaks um later if we can bookmark
 
06:23:30.230 --> 06:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
this question but it's my understanding
 
06:23:31.990 --> 06:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
that the

yep represent representative gunski
 
06:23:47.430 --> 06:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative gunski then
 
06:23:48.548 --> 06:23:48.558 align:start position:0%
representative followed by

representative post
 
06:23:52.708 --> 06:23:52.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
06:23:55.990 --> 06:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to ask another question on
 
06:23:57.510 --> 06:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
how do we determine the amount of
 
06:24:00.150 --> 06:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
fluoride an individual takes in to their
 
06:24:02.470 --> 06:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
body when consumption is very different
 
06:24:04.788 --> 06:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
between individuals and has the state
 
06:24:08.150 --> 06:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
taking that into consideration
 
06:24:10.868 --> 06:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
well this the cdc set the standards
 
06:24:13.750 --> 06:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
based on that data and it
 
06:24:15.670 --> 06:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
i stated in my testimony there and i
 
06:24:17.270 --> 06:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
think someone else stated previously
 
06:24:19.510 --> 06:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
there used to be a range of for
 
06:24:19.520 --> 06:24:21.030 align:start position:0%
there used to be a range of for
optimization

06:24:21.030 --> 06:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
optimization
 
06:24:21.040 --> 06:24:22.948 align:start position:0%
optimization
um

06:24:22.948 --> 06:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:24.310 --> 06:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
in in the
 
06:24:26.310 --> 06:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
based on based on the research based on
 
06:24:28.230 --> 06:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
the practice of fluoridation they've
 
06:24:32.230 --> 06:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
determined that 0.7 milligrams per liter
 
06:24:32.240 --> 06:24:33.030 align:start position:0%
determined that 0.7 milligrams per liter
is

06:24:33.030 --> 06:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:24:36.390 --> 06:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
is a safe amount um based on the the
 
06:24:38.310 --> 06:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
amount of water that people drink in
 
06:24:41.030 --> 06:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
various places throughout the country
 
06:24:42.548 --> 06:24:42.558 align:start position:0%
you know which you know can vary based
 
06:24:45.030 --> 06:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
on climate and activity level and that
 
06:24:48.948 --> 06:24:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:51.750 --> 06:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
do you know what uh amount
 
06:24:55.750 --> 06:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
of water that was used to determine that
 
06:24:57.270 --> 06:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
i do not know i would have to follow up
 
06:24:58.548 --> 06:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
on that
 
06:25:00.788 --> 06:25:00.798 align:start position:0%
i believe the average
 
06:25:03.910 --> 06:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
that i've seen for a male is 3.7 liters
 
06:25:07.190 --> 06:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
and a female is 2.7 those are the
 
06:25:09.510 --> 06:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
figures that i have found i just would
 
06:25:09.520 --> 06:25:10.628 align:start position:0%
figures that i have found i just would
maybe

06:25:10.628 --> 06:25:10.638 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
06:25:12.788 --> 06:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
clarify that or if you could provide
 
06:25:14.830 --> 06:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
additional information on that would be
 
06:25:17.270 --> 06:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
wonderful okay i can take that back to
 
06:25:19.510 --> 06:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
my agency and follow up on that
 
06:25:21.030 --> 06:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
06:25:21.040 --> 06:25:21.830 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
uh

06:25:21.830 --> 06:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:25:27.910 --> 06:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:31.110 --> 06:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking uh my question
 
06:25:34.150 --> 06:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to ask miss uh
 
06:25:35.510 --> 06:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh craber
 
06:25:37.910 --> 06:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
if she's done any research on the
 
06:25:40.868 --> 06:25:40.878 align:start position:0%
adverse effects of fluoride in children
 
06:25:42.548 --> 06:25:42.558 align:start position:0%
and adults
 
06:25:46.230 --> 06:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:48.150 --> 06:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
so i've you know i've read through the
 
06:25:51.670 --> 06:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
various studies and the various findings
 
06:25:53.990 --> 06:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
and again stand by my testimony about
 
06:25:54.000 --> 06:25:59.190 align:start position:0%
and again stand by my testimony about
that

06:25:59.190 --> 06:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:04.390 --> 06:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:06.230 --> 06:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
does that uh
 
06:26:10.310 --> 06:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
answer your question representative post
 
06:26:13.270 --> 06:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
that's fine thank you
 
06:26:16.548 --> 06:26:16.558 align:start position:0%
is there any other representatives who
 
06:26:19.430 --> 06:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:21.590 --> 06:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative mayville
 
06:26:37.750 --> 06:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:39.990 --> 06:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair for taking
 
06:26:41.750 --> 06:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
my question this is a question from ms
 
06:26:41.760 --> 06:26:43.270 align:start position:0%
my question this is a question from ms
craver

06:26:43.270 --> 06:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
craver
 
06:26:45.430 --> 06:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
i noted that the american health
 
06:26:47.990 --> 06:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
rankings throughout the united states
 
06:26:50.150 --> 06:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
showed new hampshire is number 44 out of
 
06:26:52.788 --> 06:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
50 for many many years related to the
 
06:26:55.030 --> 06:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
fluoridation of our water supply right
 
06:26:57.430 --> 06:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
down there with louisiana dc and new
 
06:26:59.670 --> 06:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
jersey i'm wondering what your agency
 
06:27:02.708 --> 06:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
has done to increase public awareness of
 
06:27:05.990 --> 06:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
the benefit of fluoridation in water as
 
06:27:08.868 --> 06:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
someone who doesn't seem to have a
 
06:27:10.548 --> 06:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
have skin in the game other than this
 
06:27:12.230 --> 06:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
being a public health
 
06:27:12.240 --> 06:27:13.030 align:start position:0%
being a public health
um

06:27:13.030 --> 06:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:14.788 --> 06:27:14.798 align:start position:0%
you know assistance
 
06:27:16.070 --> 06:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
and that's really interesting to
 
06:27:17.430 --> 06:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
understand that you know
 
06:27:20.390 --> 06:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
why why we rank so low
 
06:27:23.350 --> 06:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
um so you're you're correct we do rank
 
06:27:26.390 --> 06:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
we do rank low in the nation um in the
 
06:27:27.990 --> 06:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
in those rankings are based on the
 
06:27:30.070 --> 06:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
proportion of the residents served by
 
06:27:32.070 --> 06:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
community water systems who receive
 
06:27:34.868 --> 06:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
fluoridated water um
 
06:27:37.030 --> 06:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
and so it's not even it's it's taking
 
06:27:38.468 --> 06:27:38.478 align:start position:0%
it's not even taking into account the
 
06:27:40.150 --> 06:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
people who are on private well so it's
 
06:27:41.830 --> 06:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
looking just at those server public
 
06:27:44.150 --> 06:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
water systems and we have one of the
 
06:27:46.468 --> 06:27:46.478 align:start position:0%
lowest proportions in the country served
 
06:27:50.708 --> 06:27:50.718 align:start position:0%
by um fluoridated systems and you know
 
06:27:53.030 --> 06:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
what we're continuing to do through work
 
06:27:54.868 --> 06:27:54.878 align:start position:0%
with the oral health program is to
 
06:27:57.270 --> 06:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
provide education on the health benefits
 
06:27:59.670 --> 06:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
of fluoridation the safety of
 
06:28:01.990 --> 06:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
fluoridation and also how it can save
 
06:28:04.548 --> 06:28:04.558 align:start position:0%
money as a practice
 
06:28:06.230 --> 06:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
and you're right we don't have skin in
 
06:28:07.830 --> 06:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
the game other than inferring the health
 
06:28:09.510 --> 06:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire residents and that is
 
06:28:15.030 --> 06:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:17.510 --> 06:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
we would like to see new hampshire be
 
06:28:20.150 --> 06:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
higher in those rankings that is a goal
 
06:28:28.628 --> 06:28:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:29.750 --> 06:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
any other
 
06:28:31.510 --> 06:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just asking any other
 
06:28:31.520 --> 06:28:33.670 align:start position:0%
i'm just asking any other

water and we urge the committee to
 
06:30:01.590 --> 06:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
recommend hb 611 as all to pass just as

you did in 2019 with a bipartisan 16-3

06:30:22.708 --> 06:30:22.718 align:start position:0%
several days and the first is under the
 
06:30:25.110 --> 06:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
title fluoridation deposition videos and
 
06:30:27.430 --> 06:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
this includes three short videos
 
06:30:28.948 --> 06:30:28.958 align:start position:0%
featuring our attorney for our federal
 
06:30:31.510 --> 06:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against epa introducing and
 
06:30:33.350 --> 06:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
showing several clips from deposition
 
06:30:35.830 --> 06:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
deposition videos of representatives
 
06:30:38.310 --> 06:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
under oath speaking on behalf of the cdc
 
06:30:41.030 --> 06:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
and epa acknowledging under threat of
 
06:30:43.430 --> 06:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
perjury they cannot actually verify the
 
06:30:45.270 --> 06:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
safety or effectiveness of water
 
06:30:47.590 --> 06:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
fluoridation for the fetus or bottle fed
 
06:30:49.910 --> 06:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
infants what you've just heard from the
 
06:30:52.708 --> 06:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
nh dhhs person was just talking points
 
06:30:54.548 --> 06:30:54.558 align:start position:0%
from the american dental association you
 
06:30:56.548 --> 06:30:56.558 align:start position:0%
heard a lobbying presentation
 
06:30:57.910 --> 06:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
the first clip you will see is from
 
06:30:59.910 --> 06:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
casey hannon the oral health director of
 
06:31:02.868 --> 06:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
the cdc who confirms there is absolutely
 
06:31:05.190 --> 06:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
no benefit whatsoever of flow from
 
06:31:07.110 --> 06:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
fluoride to the fetus or to bottle fed
 
06:31:08.948 --> 06:31:08.958 align:start position:0%
infants they have no teeth there's no
 
06:31:11.670 --> 06:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
benefit meanwhile you see a second video
 
06:31:14.548 --> 06:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
where he says the cdc has zero no
 
06:31:17.670 --> 06:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
studies or data showing uh safety
 
06:31:19.750 --> 06:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
regarding fluoride and the brain
 
06:31:22.868 --> 06:31:22.878 align:start position:0%
meanwhile there are now over 66 human
 
06:31:25.030 --> 06:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed published studies showing
 
06:31:27.590 --> 06:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
that fluoride is a neurotoxin so when we
 
06:31:29.030 --> 06:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
just heard there's no scientific
 
06:31:30.948 --> 06:31:30.958 align:start position:0%
evidence showing harm that you you know
 
06:31:33.190 --> 06:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
you should ask why haven't you found it
 
06:31:34.548 --> 06:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
because it was published in jama
 
06:31:36.868 --> 06:31:36.878 align:start position:0%
pediatrics only the most credible
 
06:31:38.708 --> 06:31:38.718 align:start position:0%
pediatric journal in the united states
 
06:31:40.150 --> 06:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
it was published in the lancet the
 
06:31:42.070 --> 06:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
oldest medical journal in the world it
 
06:31:43.270 --> 06:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
was published in the journal of
 
06:31:45.590 --> 06:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
pediatrics i mean
 
06:31:47.670 --> 06:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
this is absurd just look for it i mean
 
06:31:49.990 --> 06:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
you're hearing talking points the third
 
06:31:52.070 --> 06:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
deposition video is from dr joyce
 
06:31:54.390 --> 06:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
donahue from the office of drinking
 
06:31:57.110 --> 06:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
water at the epa who says based on the
 
06:31:59.190 --> 06:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
new science over the past several years
 
06:32:01.510 --> 06:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
the epa's current fluoride regulations
 
06:32:04.390 --> 06:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
are not safe so under oath you get a
 
06:32:06.868 --> 06:32:06.878 align:start position:0%
totally different message than you do on
 
06:32:08.708 --> 06:32:08.718 align:start position:0%
talking points
 
06:32:10.868 --> 06:32:10.878 align:start position:0%
when you realize okay so i'll just move
 
06:32:12.868 --> 06:32:12.878 align:start position:0%
on just for the sake of time the second
 
06:32:15.190 --> 06:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
email you received was under the title
 
06:32:17.510 --> 06:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
fluoridation studies showing harm there
 
06:32:20.310 --> 06:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
is now a large body of government funded
 
06:32:24.390 --> 06:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
nih or cdc funded research indicating so
 
06:32:25.670 --> 06:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
i mean i guess they don't find that
 
06:32:27.270 --> 06:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
credible i don't know indicating that
 
06:32:30.150 --> 06:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
fluoride is neurotoxic is associated
 
06:32:32.150 --> 06:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
with lowered iq in children and a
 
06:32:35.590 --> 06:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
significant increase in adhd diagnosis
 
06:32:38.468 --> 06:32:38.478 align:start position:0%
uh the experts in toxicology have
 
06:32:40.390 --> 06:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
likened the size of the effect to that
 
06:32:43.270 --> 06:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
from lead including bruce lamphier who
 
06:32:45.110 --> 06:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
was the person the scientists in the 80s
 
06:32:48.150 --> 06:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
and 90s that caused
 
06:32:50.150 --> 06:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
raise the alarms about low levels of
 
06:32:52.390 --> 06:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
lead exposure that works for the boston
 
06:32:54.548 --> 06:32:54.558 align:start position:0%
children to our apartment uh
 
06:32:55.990 --> 06:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's someone else but that's bollinger
 
06:32:58.390 --> 06:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
but so it's now they're not comparing it
 
06:32:59.910 --> 06:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
to the size of lead
 
06:33:01.510 --> 06:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
we invite you to read these studies
 
06:33:03.910 --> 06:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
yourself don't trust me i sent you the
 
06:33:06.390 --> 06:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
studies the links to pubmed read them
 
06:33:07.510 --> 06:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
the people on the other side are going
 
06:33:09.910 --> 06:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
to tell you don't read the studies trust
 
06:33:12.310 --> 06:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
us listen to our endorsements these
 
06:33:14.868 --> 06:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
unscientific endorsements none of which
 
06:33:16.708 --> 06:33:16.718 align:start position:0%
they're all decades old none of which
 
06:33:18.628 --> 06:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
you know have been taken since these
 
06:33:20.310 --> 06:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
studies have come out these endorsements
 
06:33:22.070 --> 06:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
are meaningless most of these studies
 
06:33:24.868 --> 06:33:24.878 align:start position:0%
have come out since 2017 decades after
 
06:33:26.230 --> 06:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
these endorsements were first
 
06:33:26.240 --> 06:33:27.510 align:start position:0%
these endorsements were first
acknowledged

06:33:27.510 --> 06:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledged
 
06:33:29.190 --> 06:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
this committee has a rich history of
 
06:33:30.788 --> 06:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
taking action to protect new hampshire
 
06:33:33.590 --> 06:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
citizens from fluoridation in 2012 when
 
06:33:35.510 --> 06:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
the centers for disease control reported
 
06:33:38.150 --> 06:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
that 41 percent of our teenagers now had
 
06:33:40.468 --> 06:33:40.478 align:start position:0%
dental fluorosis a permanent
 
06:33:42.070 --> 06:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
discoloration and weakening of the
 
06:33:44.070 --> 06:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
enamel caused by
 
06:33:46.468 --> 06:33:46.478 align:start position:0%
systemic or swallowing fluoride prior to
 
06:33:48.628 --> 06:33:48.638 align:start position:0%
eight years of age 41
 
06:33:50.468 --> 06:33:50.478 align:start position:0%
this committee and the legislature
 
06:33:53.590 --> 06:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
passed hb 1416 making it law in florida
 
06:33:55.750 --> 06:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
communities to warn parents not to
 
06:33:57.750 --> 06:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
reconstitute infant formula with
 
06:33:59.910 --> 06:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
fluoridated tap water so already we
 
06:34:01.190 --> 06:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
acknowledge we shouldn't be giving this
 
06:34:02.390 --> 06:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
to infants we're still going to put it
 
06:34:03.590 --> 06:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
in the water
 
06:34:05.910 --> 06:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
so that that action was prophetic
 
06:34:08.070 --> 06:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
because two years later the u.s
 
06:34:09.590 --> 06:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
06:34:11.030 --> 06:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
lowered the recommended level of
 
06:34:13.910 --> 06:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
fluoride in the water by 40 percent
 
06:34:16.230 --> 06:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
because of this overexposure so the same
 
06:34:17.510 --> 06:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
people on the other side now they're
 
06:34:19.190 --> 06:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
telling you safe and effective read the
 
06:34:20.868 --> 06:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
talking point safe and effective we're
 
06:34:22.628 --> 06:34:22.638 align:start position:0%
saying the same thing there for a level
 
06:34:25.430 --> 06:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
of 1.2 before they were forced to lower
 
06:34:28.070 --> 06:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
it so i mean listen who's been right so
 
06:34:31.270 --> 06:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
now in 2019 the cdc published updated
 
06:34:33.830 --> 06:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
data showing that number went from 41
 
06:34:37.030 --> 06:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
to now 65 percent of adolescents have
 
06:34:39.830 --> 06:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
dental fluorosis it's only going up
 
06:34:42.310 --> 06:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
this committee heard testimony in 2019
 
06:34:44.708 --> 06:34:44.718 align:start position:0%
about new studies the first was bashes
 
06:34:46.628 --> 06:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
showing that low levels of fluoride this
 
06:34:48.868 --> 06:34:48.878 align:start position:0%
was nih funded national institutes of
 
06:34:51.350 --> 06:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
health funded low levels of fluoride
 
06:34:54.310 --> 06:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
caused a five to seven point iq loss
 
06:34:56.070 --> 06:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
there was other studies that confirmed
 
06:34:57.670 --> 06:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
that we heard from
 
06:35:00.070 --> 06:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
peckham that there was a 62 percent
 
06:35:03.190 --> 06:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
increase in hypothyroidism diagnosis in
 
06:35:05.990 --> 06:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
optimally fluoridated communities of 0.7
 
06:35:07.510 --> 06:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
and i could keep going on there's
 
06:35:08.868 --> 06:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
there's more
 
06:35:11.430 --> 06:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
higher levels in bashash 2018 and
 
06:35:13.190 --> 06:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
environmental international higher
 
06:35:14.628 --> 06:35:14.638 align:start position:0%
levels of fluoride exposure during
 
06:35:16.548 --> 06:35:16.558 align:start position:0%
pregnancy were associated with global
 
06:35:19.110 --> 06:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
measures of adhd and more symptoms so
 
06:35:20.868 --> 06:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
now two years later what has happened
 
06:35:23.110 --> 06:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
since you guys voted sixteen to three on
 
06:35:24.628 --> 06:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
that last bill what has happened you
 
06:35:25.990 --> 06:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
were proven right
 
06:35:28.948 --> 06:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
six new studies funded by nih or cdc
 
06:35:32.390 --> 06:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
using cdc data have confirmed that of
 
06:35:34.390 --> 06:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
these effects the first was published in
 
06:35:36.230 --> 06:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
last year in the journal of
 
06:35:37.830 --> 06:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
american medical association's journal
 
06:35:40.310 --> 06:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
pediatrics talk about credible
 
06:35:42.628 --> 06:35:42.638 align:start position:0%
journal pediatrics and it showed that
 
06:35:44.390 --> 06:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
children in canadian optimally
 
06:35:46.390 --> 06:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
fluoridated communities had an average
 
06:35:49.110 --> 06:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
of five to seven points lower iq
 
06:35:50.548 --> 06:35:50.558 align:start position:0%
because their mothers were exposed
 
06:35:52.708 --> 06:35:52.718 align:start position:0%
during uh while the fetus was developing
 
06:35:53.910 --> 06:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
they're exposed to just optimally
 
06:35:56.788 --> 06:35:56.798 align:start position:0%
fluoridated water rydell found this one
 
06:35:58.548 --> 06:35:58.558 align:start position:0%
was published in the leading toxicology
 
06:36:00.070 --> 06:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
journal environmental international
 
06:36:03.030 --> 06:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
found a shocking 284
 
06:36:05.350 --> 06:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
increase in the prevalence of adhd among
 
06:36:07.430 --> 06:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
children in fluoridated communities the
 
06:36:10.070 --> 06:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
list goes on there there are now seven
 
06:36:12.150 --> 06:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
mother offspring studies most of which
 
06:36:15.350 --> 06:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
funded by nih showing that women during
 
06:36:17.270 --> 06:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
the fetal development or bottle-fed
 
06:36:20.070 --> 06:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
infants uh who's all who's all their
 
06:36:22.788 --> 06:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
nutrition nutrition all their meals are
 
06:36:25.670 --> 06:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
re being used with reconstituted florida
 
06:36:27.830 --> 06:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
tap water have lowered iq and increased
 
06:36:30.070 --> 06:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
adhd rates i've sent you the studies
 
06:36:32.230 --> 06:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
don't trust me read them the other side
 
06:36:33.990 --> 06:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't want you to read them now the
 
06:36:35.910 --> 06:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legislature has proven
 
06:36:37.830 --> 06:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
willing to act before federal agencies
 
06:36:39.990 --> 06:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
on protecting citizens from toxins you
 
06:36:43.030 --> 06:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
banned mtbe from gasoline bpa from
 
06:36:44.708 --> 06:36:44.718 align:start position:0%
infant bottles and created the most
 
06:36:47.350 --> 06:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
protective standards on pfoas despite
 
06:36:50.468 --> 06:36:50.478 align:start position:0%
inaction by the epa and cdc and the us
 
06:36:52.548 --> 06:36:52.558 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
06:36:54.150 --> 06:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
let me tell you when they lowered the
 
06:36:56.548 --> 06:36:56.558 align:start position:0%
fluoride levels in 2014
 
06:36:58.468 --> 06:36:58.478 align:start position:0%
that was after the national research
 
06:37:00.708 --> 06:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
council in 2006
 
06:37:03.190 --> 06:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
told them those levels weren't safe and
 
06:37:04.310 --> 06:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
that chill infants were being
 
06:37:06.868 --> 06:37:06.878 align:start position:0%
overexposed it took them what's that
 
06:37:08.868 --> 06:37:08.878 align:start position:0%
eight years to actually implement those
 
06:37:11.190 --> 06:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
actions are we gonna wait now and let
 
06:37:13.990 --> 06:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
thousands more uh citizens just be
 
06:37:16.788 --> 06:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
harmed while we wait for federal action
 
06:37:18.390 --> 06:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
and let me point out something we talk
 
06:37:20.310 --> 06:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
about lack of credibility or
 
06:37:22.948 --> 06:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
just a month ago the former director of
 
06:37:24.708 --> 06:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
the national institute of environmental
 
06:37:26.868 --> 06:37:26.878 align:start position:0%
health sciences that's nih and the
 
06:37:29.190 --> 06:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
national toxicology program of the
 
06:37:30.868 --> 06:37:30.878 align:start position:0%
national institutes of health her name
 
06:37:32.548 --> 06:37:32.558 align:start position:0%
is linda bernbaum
 
06:37:35.030 --> 06:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
former ntp director the lead the
 
06:37:37.510 --> 06:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
most renowned toxicologist in the world
 
06:37:39.190 --> 06:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
wrote an op-ed that was published in
 
06:37:41.190 --> 06:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
environmental health news titled it's
 
06:37:42.948 --> 06:37:42.958 align:start position:0%
time to protect our kids developing
 
06:37:45.270 --> 06:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
brains from fluoride and she talks about
 
06:37:46.868 --> 06:37:46.878 align:start position:0%
ending fluoridation because of all of
 
06:37:49.190 --> 06:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
these studies she's not alone
 
06:37:51.590 --> 06:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
the the jama pediatrics
 
06:37:54.310 --> 06:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
editor a physician from seattle said
 
06:37:56.310 --> 06:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
quote he would not want his wife
 
06:37:57.910 --> 06:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
drinking fluoridate water if she were
 
06:38:00.070 --> 06:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
pregnant the co-host the editor of the
 
06:38:02.150 --> 06:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
entire jama journal network also
 
06:38:04.230 --> 06:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
physician said the same thing and raised
 
06:38:05.910 --> 06:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
the important issue of how low-income
 
06:38:07.990 --> 06:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
women could avoid fluoride while
 
06:38:09.990 --> 06:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
pregnant they can't
 
06:38:12.548 --> 06:38:12.558 align:start position:0%
um the 2020 study shown that bottle-fed
 
06:38:14.948 --> 06:38:14.958 align:start position:0%
infants were overexposed and lowered
 
06:38:17.510 --> 06:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
their iq of fluoridated water optimally
 
06:38:19.110 --> 06:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
lower their iq this was again
 
06:38:22.310 --> 06:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
republished in the journal pediatrics
 
06:38:24.070 --> 06:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
just last year in their column of
 
06:38:26.868 --> 06:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
current best evidence translating best
 
06:38:28.628 --> 06:38:28.638 align:start position:0%
evidence in the best care
 
06:38:31.110 --> 06:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
so please read those studies i sent
 
06:38:33.270 --> 06:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
even leading neuroscientist david
 
06:38:34.868 --> 06:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
bellinger of the boston children's
 
06:38:36.788 --> 06:38:36.798 align:start position:0%
hospital and harvard
 
06:38:38.708 --> 06:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
uh included fluoride in a list of
 
06:38:40.390 --> 06:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
chemicals known or suspected to
 
06:38:42.548 --> 06:38:42.558 align:start position:0%
interfere with neurodevelopment of
 
06:38:42.558 --> 06:38:43.670 align:start position:0%
interfere with neurodevelopment of
children

06:38:43.670 --> 06:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:38:43.680 --> 06:38:44.628 align:start position:0%
children
so

06:38:44.628 --> 06:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:38:46.150 --> 06:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
and i'll just finish off i know thank
 
06:38:48.230 --> 06:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
you very much for letting me go on i'll
 
06:38:49.750 --> 06:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
finish off with one last point because
 
06:38:51.430 --> 06:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
it was raised last about how new
 
06:38:53.350 --> 06:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire is ranked 44 in fluoridated
 
06:38:53.360 --> 06:38:54.310 align:start position:0%
hampshire is ranked 44 in fluoridated
water

06:38:54.310 --> 06:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
water
 
06:38:56.468 --> 06:38:56.478 align:start position:0%
that's true we are we're very low in
 
06:38:58.230 --> 06:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
fluoridated water but the proponents
 
06:38:59.830 --> 06:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to tell you is that new
 
06:39:01.670 --> 06:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire children have the third lowest
 
06:39:03.990 --> 06:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
rate of dental decay in the nation
 
06:39:05.510 --> 06:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're the one of the least fluoridated
 
06:39:07.510 --> 06:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
states we have the third lowest rate of
 
06:39:09.510 --> 06:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
dental decay in the nation vermont which
 
06:39:11.190 --> 06:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
has uh which is
 
06:39:14.230 --> 06:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
ranked 39 for fluoridation so also low
 
06:39:16.310 --> 06:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
is second lowest rate of dental decay in
 
06:39:17.510 --> 06:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
the nation
 
06:39:19.270 --> 06:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
so we don't need this unnecessary
 
06:39:21.110 --> 06:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
chemical in our water supply to treat
 
06:39:23.670 --> 06:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
people um and let's look at the three
 
06:39:25.750 --> 06:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
most fluoridated communities now and
 
06:39:28.390 --> 06:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
kentucky 99 fluoridated
 
06:39:30.390 --> 06:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
they have a rate that's double their
 
06:39:32.390 --> 06:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
third grade dental decay rate is 60
 
06:39:34.708 --> 06:39:34.718 align:start position:0%
percent that's double new hampshire's
 
06:39:37.430 --> 06:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
rate of uh 34
 
06:39:40.230 --> 06:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
minnesota 98 fluoridated the rate of
 
06:39:43.990 --> 06:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
decay is 54 compared to our 34. illinois
 
06:39:46.868 --> 06:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
98.5 fluoridated their rate of decay is
 
06:39:46.878 --> 06:39:48.468 align:start position:0%
98.5 fluoridated their rate of decay is
52.4

06:39:48.468 --> 06:39:48.478 align:start position:0%
52.4
 
06:39:50.070 --> 06:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's
 
06:39:50.080 --> 06:39:50.948 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's
so

06:39:50.948 --> 06:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:39:52.628 --> 06:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
listen i've sent you the science i've
 
06:39:54.390 --> 06:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
sent you all of these these these
 
06:39:55.670 --> 06:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
articles and journal articles from the
 
06:39:57.510 --> 06:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
leading toxicologist this is a really
 
06:40:00.150 --> 06:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
simple solution um you know we can fix
 
06:40:02.468 --> 06:40:02.478 align:start position:0%
that we can fix decay but you can't fix
 
06:40:04.390 --> 06:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
someone's brain after it's been damaged
 
06:40:06.468 --> 06:40:06.478 align:start position:0%
let's take action let's protect our
 
06:40:08.310 --> 06:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
children read the studies don't trust me
 
06:40:10.070 --> 06:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
but read the studies and ask those
 
06:40:12.548 --> 06:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
people that are now advocating this ask
 
06:40:14.468 --> 06:40:14.478 align:start position:0%
them say what are the fluorescence rates
 
06:40:15.990 --> 06:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire because they don't have
 
06:40:17.350 --> 06:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
an answer to that
 
06:40:19.270 --> 06:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
all we know is at the federal level they
 
06:40:22.150 --> 06:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:23.670 --> 06:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
mr cooper
 
06:40:25.750 --> 06:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess you turn them back on
 
06:40:27.510 --> 06:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
mr cooper
 
06:40:29.190 --> 06:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
yes i'm sorry
 
06:40:30.548 --> 06:40:30.558 align:start position:0%
mr cooper
 
06:40:31.750 --> 06:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
06:40:34.230 --> 06:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know i've let you go for a long
 
06:40:36.948 --> 06:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
time for a fairly long
 
06:40:38.390 --> 06:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh time
 
06:40:40.468 --> 06:40:40.478 align:start position:0%
uh i tried to get
 
06:40:40.478 --> 06:40:41.350 align:start position:0%
uh i tried to get
uh

06:40:41.350 --> 06:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:40:43.750 --> 06:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
the beginning and you know the the first
 
06:40:46.230 --> 06:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
of pros and cons out
 
06:40:48.310 --> 06:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh for both
 
06:40:51.270 --> 06:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
on both sides so i let folks go
 
06:40:51.280 --> 06:40:52.548 align:start position:0%
on both sides so i let folks go
uh

06:40:52.548 --> 06:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:40:55.670 --> 06:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
but i i think it's time we moved on if
 
06:40:57.030 --> 06:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
you can uh
 
06:40:58.310 --> 06:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
wrap up
 
06:41:01.590 --> 06:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
oh yes i'm done i've spent over a decade
 
06:41:02.948 --> 06:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
studying this issue so if anybody has
 
06:41:05.110 --> 06:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
any questions uh feel free to ask i
 
06:41:06.628 --> 06:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
could answer just about all the ones

who is the next next we have brandon
 
06:41:30.390 --> 06:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
kernan with the new hampshire department
 
06:41:32.868 --> 06:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
of environmental services okay speaking
 
06:41:34.788 --> 06:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the deal all right mr

i'm brandon kernan i'm the administrator
 
06:42:33.830 --> 06:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
of the drinking water and groundwater
 
06:42:33.840 --> 06:42:34.948 align:start position:0%
of the drinking water and groundwater
bureau

06:42:34.948 --> 06:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
06:42:36.628 --> 06:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the opportunity to
 
06:42:39.430 --> 06:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
testify today the department opposes
 
06:42:40.628 --> 06:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:42:42.788 --> 06:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
we support fluoridation consistent with
 
06:42:45.110 --> 06:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations of cdc to prevent tooth
 
06:42:45.120 --> 06:42:46.390 align:start position:0%
recommendations of cdc to prevent tooth
decay

06:42:46.390 --> 06:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
decay
 
06:42:47.910 --> 06:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
most of my points were covered by ms
 
06:42:49.670 --> 06:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
craver earlier
 
06:42:52.070 --> 06:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know there's a process to allow and
 
06:42:54.150 --> 06:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
abolish at the local level fluoridation
 
06:42:56.150 --> 06:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
so communities have control over this
 
06:42:57.830 --> 06:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
process at the primary water system
 
06:42:57.840 --> 06:42:59.030 align:start position:0%
process at the primary water system
level

06:42:59.030 --> 06:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
level
 
06:43:01.350 --> 06:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
and also when there is fluoridation
 
06:43:03.510 --> 06:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
there are rules in place and processes
 
06:43:05.350 --> 06:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
in place to ensure the design and the
 
06:43:09.350 --> 06:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
operations of the fluoridation process
 
06:43:11.670 --> 06:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
meets regulatory requirements and that
 
06:43:14.150 --> 06:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
the appropriate levels of fluoride are
 
06:43:16.390 --> 06:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
maintained and there's safety measures
 
06:43:18.628 --> 06:43:18.638 align:start position:0%
involved to protect from overfeeding
 
06:43:20.548 --> 06:43:20.558 align:start position:0%
and we also require operators with
 
06:43:22.708 --> 06:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
higher certification levels oversee the
 
06:43:24.548 --> 06:43:24.558 align:start position:0%
pro process
 
06:43:26.390 --> 06:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
as far as the chemicals used they have
 
06:43:28.390 --> 06:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
to be certified by the national
 
06:43:30.548 --> 06:43:30.558 align:start position:0%
sanitation foundation um our drinking
 
06:43:33.590 --> 06:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
water rules address um where uh what
 
06:43:35.590 --> 06:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
type of chemicals you have
 
06:43:38.390 --> 06:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
fluoride or other treatment chemicals um
 
06:43:39.510 --> 06:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
where they can come from and what
 
06:43:41.270 --> 06:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
certifications they require for drinking
 
06:43:41.280 --> 06:43:42.468 align:start position:0%
certifications they require for drinking
water

06:43:42.468 --> 06:43:42.478 align:start position:0%
water
 
06:43:43.830 --> 06:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
and i'll just end by pointing out that
 
06:43:46.628 --> 06:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
our toxicologist dr john alley
 
06:43:48.948 --> 06:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
is also signed into this meeting
 
06:43:50.788 --> 06:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
should you have more questions about
 
06:43:53.910 --> 06:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:55.670 --> 06:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
and that's it thank you
 
06:43:57.590 --> 06:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you very much any
 
06:44:02.548 --> 06:44:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:02.558 --> 06:44:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:44:03.990 --> 06:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:44:04.000 --> 06:44:04.788 align:start position:0%
uh
this

06:44:04.788 --> 06:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:44:04.798 --> 06:44:05.590 align:start position:0%
this
is

06:44:05.590 --> 06:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:44:07.190 --> 06:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative creighton
 
06:44:11.750 --> 06:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:13.670 --> 06:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
i asked the same question
 
06:44:15.750 --> 06:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
you just heard the
 
06:44:18.708 --> 06:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
testimony of mr cooper
 
06:44:20.548 --> 06:44:20.558 align:start position:0%
in claiming
 
06:44:24.150 --> 06:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
all sorts of medical issues
 
06:44:25.750 --> 06:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
several times now
 
06:44:25.760 --> 06:44:27.030 align:start position:0%
several times now
uh

06:44:27.030 --> 06:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:44:32.868 --> 06:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:34.708 --> 06:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
our agency
 
06:44:36.310 --> 06:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
first we have our toxicologist that
 
06:44:38.390 --> 06:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
tracks the science and looks for
 
06:44:40.390 --> 06:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
scientific research that has achieved
 
06:44:42.948 --> 06:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
consensus across the experts and then we
 
06:44:44.948 --> 06:44:44.958 align:start position:0%
also collaborate with other drinking
 
06:44:47.510 --> 06:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
water programs at the national level to
 
06:44:49.110 --> 06:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
share information
 
06:44:52.310 --> 06:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
and at this point we have agreed with
 
06:44:54.628 --> 06:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
the position that epa in the cdc has
 
06:44:56.310 --> 06:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
taken on fluoridation
 
06:44:58.468 --> 06:44:58.478 align:start position:0%
that being said we continue to review
 
06:45:00.708 --> 06:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
the information for this chemical and
 
06:45:02.948 --> 06:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
other chemicals that might be in
 
06:45:05.110 --> 06:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
drinking water and revised policies
 
06:45:08.788 --> 06:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:10.868 --> 06:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
06:45:14.868 --> 06:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:18.150 --> 06:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
oh representative moran for a question
 
06:45:20.628 --> 06:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um
 
06:45:23.510 --> 06:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
maybe i missed it um can did you offer
 
06:45:28.948 --> 06:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:30.948 --> 06:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
it's bought from companies that have
 
06:45:33.030 --> 06:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
achieved national sanitation foundation
 
06:45:35.510 --> 06:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
certification and so i could i could
 
06:45:37.830 --> 06:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
provide you a list of companies that
 
06:45:39.350 --> 06:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
typically provide drinking water
 
06:45:41.030 --> 06:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
chemicals such as the chemicals used to
 
06:45:41.040 --> 06:45:42.390 align:start position:0%
chemicals such as the chemicals used to
fluoridate

06:45:42.390 --> 06:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
fluoridate
 
06:45:43.670 --> 06:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
i don't have that in front of me right
 
06:45:45.350 --> 06:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
now but that's something that you can
 
06:45:47.750 --> 06:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
certainly follow up with
 
06:45:51.190 --> 06:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
yeah if that would be great thank you
 
06:45:58.310 --> 06:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:01.350 --> 06:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative gold
 
06:46:03.350 --> 06:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
yes i have a question uh
 
06:46:06.150 --> 06:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
06:46:07.830 --> 06:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
the uh this uh
 
06:46:10.150 --> 06:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
the des is mainly just concerned about
 
06:46:13.030 --> 06:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
the uh technical aspects of uh
 
06:46:17.110 --> 06:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
fluoride they do they go into the uh
 
06:46:18.628 --> 06:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
you know what happens to people if they
 
06:46:20.868 --> 06:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
have fluoride or anything or is it are
 
06:46:23.030 --> 06:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
you just concerned about how it's put
 
06:46:24.948 --> 06:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
into the water and
 
06:46:29.030 --> 06:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:30.230 --> 06:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about all of our
 
06:46:32.230 --> 06:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
drinking water standards and guidelines
 
06:46:33.910 --> 06:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
to ensure they're protective of public
 
06:46:35.270 --> 06:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
health and
 
06:46:36.628 --> 06:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
you continue to look at the best
 
06:46:38.788 --> 06:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
available science and so
 
06:46:41.510 --> 06:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
oh no we don't turn a blind eye to
 
06:46:43.670 --> 06:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
other information about about our
 
06:46:46.468 --> 06:46:46.478 align:start position:0%
standards um so and we also have a
 
06:46:48.948 --> 06:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
toxicologist that reviews our standards
 
06:46:51.590 --> 06:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
and guidelines and as science emerges
 
06:46:53.190 --> 06:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
they can change our guidelines and
 
06:46:54.468 --> 06:46:54.478 align:start position:0%
standards can change over time as
 
06:46:54.478 --> 06:47:03.270 align:start position:0%
standards can change over time as
warranted

06:47:03.270 --> 06:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:04.788 --> 06:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:47:04.798 --> 06:47:05.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

06:47:05.590 --> 06:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:08.868 --> 06:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
i wanted to ask um mr kiernan have you
 
06:47:10.830 --> 06:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
ever done any research
 
06:47:18.390 --> 06:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:22.310 --> 06:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
no i have not researched it we rely upon
 
06:47:24.230 --> 06:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
research agencies and
 
06:47:26.310 --> 06:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
federal agencies to complete that work
 
06:47:28.070 --> 06:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
and the health and health agencies as
 
06:47:30.150 --> 06:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
well but our bureau has not conducted a
 
06:47:32.548 --> 06:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
research study
 
06:47:37.270 --> 06:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:37.280 --> 06:47:38.788 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:47:38.788 --> 06:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:47:41.590 --> 06:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
was that a yes yes oh yeah thank thank
 
06:47:44.948 --> 06:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
you um so mr kiernan the information
 
06:47:47.590 --> 06:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
you're providing us is is that from
 
06:47:50.468 --> 06:47:50.478 align:start position:0%
talking points or is that from something
 
06:47:50.478 --> 06:47:51.830 align:start position:0%
talking points or is that from something
um

06:47:51.830 --> 06:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:54.708 --> 06:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
you you know to be true by doing
 
06:47:54.718 --> 06:47:58.390 align:start position:0%
you you know to be true by doing
research

06:47:58.390 --> 06:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:58.400 --> 06:47:59.190 align:start position:0%
 
well

06:47:59.190 --> 06:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:48:01.830 --> 06:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
akin to research we have 60 years of
 
06:48:03.670 --> 06:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
experience of communities adding
 
06:48:06.310 --> 06:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
fluoride and to the extent data becomes
 
06:48:06.320 --> 06:48:07.670 align:start position:0%
fluoride and to the extent data becomes
available

06:48:07.670 --> 06:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
available
 
06:48:09.270 --> 06:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
a state agency
 
06:48:11.750 --> 06:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
in whatever form it's been over the time
 
06:48:13.350 --> 06:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
would have reacted to it but there's
 
06:48:16.468 --> 06:48:16.478 align:start position:0%
certainly um research that i guess we
 
06:48:18.230 --> 06:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
are part of that effect is we're relying
 
06:48:20.070 --> 06:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
on federal agencies and we are part of
 
06:48:22.150 --> 06:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
the federal government that do conduct
 
06:48:24.468 --> 06:48:24.478 align:start position:0%
the studies that do have the capability
 
06:48:26.548 --> 06:48:26.558 align:start position:0%
in the research scientists to keep the
 
06:48:28.230 --> 06:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
look over the studies
 
06:48:30.788 --> 06:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
and so yeah i mean that's part of that's
 
06:48:33.670 --> 06:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
part of the system we are cdc as well i
 
06:48:36.788 --> 06:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
mean they represent us so you know it's
 
06:48:41.670 --> 06:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:41.680 --> 06:48:42.868 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:48:42.868 --> 06:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:48:44.948 --> 06:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
is that any more question any other
 
06:48:44.958 --> 06:48:46.788 align:start position:0%
is that any more question any other
questions

06:48:46.788 --> 06:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:48:49.590 --> 06:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:52.868 --> 06:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
06:48:52.878 --> 06:48:53.830 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
next

06:48:53.830 --> 06:48:53.840 align:start position:0%

chess division of medicaid services
 
06:49:07.750 --> 06:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
and speaking in opposition to the goal
 
06:49:09.030 --> 06:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
sarah ben
 
06:49:13.430 --> 06:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh it's hi yes i'm dr sarah finney
 
06:49:14.628 --> 06:49:14.638 align:start position:0%

it's it's pronounced finney
 
06:49:18.708 --> 06:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
did you back up from the mic a little
 
06:49:18.718 --> 06:49:19.670 align:start position:0%
did you back up from the mic a little
bit

06:49:19.670 --> 06:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
bit
 
06:49:19.680 --> 06:49:21.270 align:start position:0%
bit
um

06:49:21.270 --> 06:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:23.030 --> 06:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
is this better
 
06:49:24.310 --> 06:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
06:49:26.390 --> 06:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
it is okay

it is okay
um

06:49:27.350 --> 06:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:30.868 --> 06:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh chairman renzolo and
 
06:49:33.190 --> 06:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i appreciate
 
06:49:35.830 --> 06:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
your time this afternoon
 
06:49:37.910 --> 06:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
as i already stated my name is dr sarah
 
06:49:41.750 --> 06:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
finney i am the medicaid dental director
 
06:49:44.708 --> 06:49:44.718 align:start position:0%
i am i am here to express my opposition
 
06:49:49.750 --> 06:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the department to hb 611
 
06:49:51.190 --> 06:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of health
 
06:49:53.510 --> 06:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
and human services division of medicaid
 
06:49:56.548 --> 06:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
services has functional responsibility
 
06:49:58.868 --> 06:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
for the medicaid program as well as
 
06:50:01.190 --> 06:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
health planning reporting data and
 
06:50:01.200 --> 06:50:03.750 align:start position:0%
health planning reporting data and
research

06:50:03.750 --> 06:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
research
 
06:50:06.310 --> 06:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
the division of medicaid services police
 
06:50:08.948 --> 06:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
policy decisions are based on scientific
 
06:50:11.110 --> 06:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
evidence and best practices
 
06:50:13.030 --> 06:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
and for the reasons which i'm about to
 
06:50:13.040 --> 06:50:13.830 align:start position:0%
and for the reasons which i'm about to
share

06:50:13.830 --> 06:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
share
 
06:50:15.910 --> 06:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
they are the reasons that we oppose this
 
06:50:15.920 --> 06:50:17.750 align:start position:0%
they are the reasons that we oppose this
bill

06:50:17.750 --> 06:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:50:19.030 --> 06:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
in the past the new hampshire
 
06:50:21.830 --> 06:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
legislature has seen fit to put in place
 
06:50:24.230 --> 06:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
a number of rsas which frame the process
 
06:50:26.310 --> 06:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
by which a community community can
 
06:50:28.070 --> 06:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not they wish to
 
06:50:30.230 --> 06:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
fluoridate their water supply or
 
06:50:32.788 --> 06:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
continue that fluoridation
 
06:50:36.070 --> 06:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
and bills similar to this bill have been
 
06:50:39.510 --> 06:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
deemed inexpedient to legislate
 
06:50:42.310 --> 06:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
as the dental director for the division
 
06:50:44.708 --> 06:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
of medicaid services i am concerned
 
06:50:46.948 --> 06:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
about the potential negative impact on
 
06:50:49.110 --> 06:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
the overall health and quality of life
 
06:50:51.270 --> 06:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
of children covered by new hampshire
 
06:50:53.510 --> 06:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
medicaid as well as other children and
 
06:50:56.548 --> 06:50:56.558 align:start position:0%
adults that live in the areas that have
 
06:50:59.190 --> 06:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
community water fluoridation
 
06:51:01.430 --> 06:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
children who are
 
06:51:03.510 --> 06:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
covered by medicaid are at high risk for
 
06:51:05.430 --> 06:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
dental disease
 
06:51:08.390 --> 06:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
and research has shown that there will
 
06:51:10.150 --> 06:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
be an increase in dental disease
 
06:51:12.310 --> 06:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
affected teeth when water systems are
 
06:51:12.320 --> 06:51:13.990 align:start position:0%
affected teeth when water systems are
defluoridated

06:51:13.990 --> 06:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
defluoridated
 
06:51:17.190 --> 06:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
the highest cost for that defluoridation
 
06:51:18.628 --> 06:51:18.638 align:start position:0%
will be for dental treatment for
 
06:51:20.230 --> 06:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
children who are born after the
 
06:51:23.190 --> 06:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
community water fluoridation is ceased
 
06:51:25.350 --> 06:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
so while we may see some increases
 
06:51:28.548 --> 06:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
initially in the costs in medicaid they
 
06:51:28.558 --> 06:51:29.510 align:start position:0%
initially in the costs in medicaid they
will

06:51:29.510 --> 06:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
will
 
06:51:32.070 --> 06:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
continue to go up as we get farther
 
06:51:34.468 --> 06:51:34.478 align:start position:0%
along in the lifespan of children who
 
06:51:36.788 --> 06:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
have not had the benefits of community
 
06:51:39.670 --> 06:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation
 
06:51:41.910 --> 06:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
additionally currently
 
06:51:44.070 --> 06:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
school-based dental programs are not in
 
06:51:47.270 --> 06:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
operation due to the pandemic and the
 
06:51:50.310 --> 06:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
ongoing situation of remote and hybrid
 
06:51:52.628 --> 06:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
learning in schools there are a number
 
06:51:54.868 --> 06:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
of children who receive their preventive
 
06:51:56.788 --> 06:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
dental care in these settings and
 
06:51:58.708 --> 06:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
they're already being impacted by the
 
06:52:00.868 --> 06:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
fact that those programs are not
 
06:52:03.190 --> 06:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
operating at this time and the loss of
 
06:52:05.590 --> 06:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
fluorinated water would add another
 
06:52:08.868 --> 06:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
impact another negative impact for them
 
06:52:11.350 --> 06:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
and this is also holding true for adults
 
06:52:13.190 --> 06:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
in these areas
 
06:52:15.750 --> 06:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
it is harder for adults to get in for
 
06:52:18.628 --> 06:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
dental care right now
 
06:52:21.830 --> 06:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
dental practices have been at a reduced
 
06:52:24.628 --> 06:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
capacity due to the pandemic and so
 
06:52:26.868 --> 06:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
there is a similar effect for adults
 
06:52:26.878 --> 06:52:27.910 align:start position:0%
there is a similar effect for adults
because

06:52:27.910 --> 06:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:52:30.468 --> 06:52:30.478 align:start position:0%
the adults do have a benefit a topical
 
06:52:33.670 --> 06:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
benefit from fluoride on their teeth so
 
06:52:36.070 --> 06:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
community water fluoridation is not just
 
06:52:38.948 --> 06:52:38.958 align:start position:0%
for children
 
06:52:41.270 --> 06:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
under current recommendations systemic
 
06:52:44.310 --> 06:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
fluoride is considered best practice
 
06:52:47.030 --> 06:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
and for tooth decay prevention in
 
06:52:50.230 --> 06:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
children from birth to 12 years of age
 
06:52:52.310 --> 06:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
administration of fluoride during this
 
06:52:55.030 --> 06:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
age range prevents future dental disease
 
06:52:57.750 --> 06:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
because the fluoride is built into
 
06:53:00.390 --> 06:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
the structure of the tooth as opposed to
 
06:53:00.400 --> 06:53:02.070 align:start position:0%
the structure of the tooth as opposed to
just

06:53:02.070 --> 06:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:53:04.708 --> 06:53:04.718 align:start position:0%
attaching on the surface
 
06:53:07.590 --> 06:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
administration of fluoride during this
 
06:53:10.070 --> 06:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
time prevents future dental disease and
 
06:53:12.468 --> 06:53:12.478 align:start position:0%
also provides the topical benefit that i
 
06:53:14.590 --> 06:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
have already described and
 
06:53:17.190 --> 06:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
remineralization of a tooth where tooth
 
06:53:19.350 --> 06:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
decay begins
 
06:53:22.788 --> 06:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
in people of all ages
 
06:53:24.948 --> 06:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
while it is impossible for the division
 
06:53:27.110 --> 06:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
of medicaid services to precisely
 
06:53:29.510 --> 06:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
calculate the increase in medicaid
 
06:53:31.270 --> 06:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
spending that would occur in a given
 
06:53:33.910 --> 06:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
year as a result of defluoridation of
 
06:53:36.948 --> 06:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
community water systems
 
06:53:38.548 --> 06:53:38.558 align:start position:0%
we could provide
 
06:53:41.190 --> 06:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
a calculation of
 
06:53:44.150 --> 06:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
an increase of 13 and a half percent of
 
06:53:45.990 --> 06:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
dental disease
 
06:53:49.510 --> 06:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the medicaid population and and
 
06:53:51.190 --> 06:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
factor that over
 
06:53:53.670 --> 06:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
what is considered to be our dental
 
06:53:57.670 --> 06:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
expenditures for state fiscal year 2022
 
06:53:59.750 --> 06:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
and that estimated increase cost would
 
06:54:03.110 --> 06:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
be approximately 1.5 million dollars and
 
06:54:05.190 --> 06:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
that would continue to increase with
 
06:54:07.430 --> 06:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
time as i mentioned earlier
 
06:54:10.070 --> 06:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
as we get farther out with more children
 
06:54:11.990 --> 06:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
having less effect from the community
 
06:54:14.230 --> 06:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation
 
06:54:17.110 --> 06:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note we also provided an
 
06:54:19.190 --> 06:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
estimate of what
 
06:54:21.830 --> 06:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
the cost would be to provide fluoride
 
06:54:24.948 --> 06:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
supplements for medicaid
 
06:54:27.350 --> 06:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
children covered by medicaid
 
06:54:27.360 --> 06:54:28.628 align:start position:0%
children covered by medicaid
and

06:54:28.628 --> 06:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:54:31.350 --> 06:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
expenditures would also increase
 
06:54:33.430 --> 06:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
for increased use of emergency
 
06:54:36.070 --> 06:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
department visits by children who may
 
06:54:40.390 --> 06:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:42.548 --> 06:54:42.558 align:start position:0%
it is for all of the reasons that i have
 
06:54:47.030 --> 06:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
spoken of which opposes and and they um
 
06:54:48.230 --> 06:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:54:50.708 --> 06:54:50.718 align:start position:0%
opposes decades of research and evidence
 
06:54:53.350 --> 06:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
that support the safe and effective
 
06:54:55.990 --> 06:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
use of optimally fluoridated water to
 
06:54:57.910 --> 06:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
improve oral health and therefore
 
06:55:00.150 --> 06:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
overall health of children and adults in
 
06:55:01.830 --> 06:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
these communities
 
06:55:04.070 --> 06:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons the department has
 
06:55:06.708 --> 06:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
chosen to oppose this legislation
 
06:55:08.150 --> 06:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for your time this
 
06:55:09.830 --> 06:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon and i'm happy to answer
 
06:55:09.840 --> 06:55:13.830 align:start position:0%
afternoon and i'm happy to answer

06:55:28.948 --> 06:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
would could you tell me um
 
06:55:31.830 --> 06:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
about the dental benefits for adults in
 
06:55:34.468 --> 06:55:34.478 align:start position:0%
new hampshire would they receive routine
 
06:55:37.670 --> 06:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
care or fluoride in treatment for dental
 
06:55:37.680 --> 06:55:38.788 align:start position:0%
care or fluoride in treatment for dental
care

06:55:38.788 --> 06:55:38.798 align:start position:0%
care
 
06:55:41.270 --> 06:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
under the current medicaid benefits
 
06:55:43.670 --> 06:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
at this time the adult medicaid dental
 
06:55:46.548 --> 06:55:46.558 align:start position:0%
benefit only covers emergency services
 
06:55:49.910 --> 06:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
so those patie the adults
 
06:55:52.628 --> 06:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
are eligible to have exams x-rays and
 
06:55:55.510 --> 06:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of pain and infection
 
06:55:58.150 --> 06:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
and then the only treatment for that
 
06:56:01.350 --> 06:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
is extractions it's a very limited
 
06:56:01.360 --> 06:56:02.868 align:start position:0%
is extractions it's a very limited
benefit

06:56:02.868 --> 06:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
06:56:06.070 --> 06:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
we are currently working um towards
 
06:56:08.468 --> 06:56:08.478 align:start position:0%
bringing in a more robust adult dental
 
06:56:10.948 --> 06:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
benefit in fact there are two bills
 
06:56:13.110 --> 06:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
going through the legislature this
 
06:56:13.120 --> 06:56:14.070 align:start position:0%
going through the legislature this
session

06:56:14.070 --> 06:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
session
 
06:56:17.510 --> 06:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
and we have a prior bill from 2019 that
 
06:56:19.750 --> 06:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
was signed into law where we are
 
06:56:22.468 --> 06:56:22.478 align:start position:0%
planning for a more comprehensive adult
 
06:56:25.350 --> 06:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
benefit but currently the adult benefit
 
06:56:29.510 --> 06:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:30.830 --> 06:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman can i have a follow-up
 
06:56:33.270 --> 06:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
please follow up
 
06:56:35.910 --> 06:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh doctor um would you say that removing
 
06:56:37.910 --> 06:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
the fluoride from the water would
 
06:56:37.920 --> 06:56:39.990 align:start position:0%
the fluoride from the water would
disadvantage

06:56:39.990 --> 06:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
06:56:41.750 --> 06:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
impact disadvantage
 
06:56:43.510 --> 06:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
in low-income
 
06:56:45.510 --> 06:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
residents of new hampshire
 
06:56:45.520 --> 06:56:47.350 align:start position:0%
residents of new hampshire
absolutely

06:56:47.350 --> 06:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
06:56:51.350 --> 06:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
the as as karen kraver said earlier
 
06:56:53.270 --> 06:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
the mission of the department of health
 
06:56:56.150 --> 06:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
and human services is to help all the
 
06:56:58.150 --> 06:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state but especially
 
06:57:00.628 --> 06:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
those who are at a disadvantage
 
06:57:03.430 --> 06:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
and community water fluoridation cuts
 
06:57:04.948 --> 06:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
across all
 
06:57:08.230 --> 06:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
educational socioeconomic
 
06:57:10.468 --> 06:57:10.478 align:start position:0%
and ethnic
 
06:57:13.110 --> 06:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
divisions among amongst our citizens in
 
06:57:15.110 --> 06:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
this state and and provides a broad
 
06:57:19.270 --> 06:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:22.150 --> 06:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman uh follow-up question
 
06:57:25.430 --> 06:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:36.948 --> 06:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:39.030 --> 06:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
and i i believe that my constituents
 
06:57:40.868 --> 06:57:40.878 align:start position:0%
would want me to ask these questions all
 
06:57:42.788 --> 06:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
right for the follow up
 
06:57:46.628 --> 06:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh doctor can you explain to me if there
 
06:57:49.750 --> 06:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
is any other supplement medication
 
06:57:54.070 --> 06:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
or vitamin or mineral that is um
 
06:57:57.110 --> 06:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
given to um residents in drinking water
 
06:57:59.110 --> 06:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
or any other manner in a public health
 
06:57:59.120 --> 06:58:02.070 align:start position:0%
or any other manner in a public health
setting

06:58:02.070 --> 06:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:04.868 --> 06:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
other than that to my
 
06:58:07.350 --> 06:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
all right i really can't speak for any
 
06:58:09.590 --> 06:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
other state than new hampshire
 
06:58:13.030 --> 06:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
but medications are not delivered
 
06:58:15.190 --> 06:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
through water systems and we need to
 
06:58:18.070 --> 06:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
remember that fluoride is a naturally
 
06:58:19.670 --> 06:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
occurring mineral
 
06:58:21.110 --> 06:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
06:58:23.110 --> 06:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
i want to make that distinction very
 
06:58:23.120 --> 06:58:25.830 align:start position:0%
i want to make that distinction very
clear

06:58:25.830 --> 06:58:25.840 align:start position:0%

i am a pediatrician in concord new
 
07:01:33.430 --> 07:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the vice president of the
 
07:01:35.350 --> 07:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire chapter of the american
 
07:01:37.590 --> 07:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
academy of pediatrics
 
07:01:40.310 --> 07:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
i am here to speak in opposition of
 
07:01:43.830 --> 07:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:46.708 --> 07:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
i want to first talk a little bit about
 
07:01:49.030 --> 07:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
dental caries so
 
07:01:51.270 --> 07:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
dental caries as we know
 
07:01:53.190 --> 07:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
commonly called cavities are an
 
07:01:55.270 --> 07:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
infectious disease
 
07:01:57.430 --> 07:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
wherein um bacteria present on a
 
07:01:58.948 --> 07:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
person's teeth
 
07:02:02.390 --> 07:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
metabolize carbohydrates forming an acid
 
07:02:05.430 --> 07:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
and eroding tooth enamel
 
07:02:07.910 --> 07:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
these cavities can progress through the
 
07:02:09.750 --> 07:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
tooth leading to
 
07:02:11.750 --> 07:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
tremendous pain
 
07:02:13.590 --> 07:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
tooth loss
 
07:02:15.990 --> 07:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
systemic infections
 
07:02:18.468 --> 07:02:18.478 align:start position:0%
in additional from a social perspective
 
07:02:21.350 --> 07:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
missed school and work
 
07:02:24.390 --> 07:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
and are the single a child's
 
07:02:26.708 --> 07:02:26.718 align:start position:0%
dental caries are the single greatest
 
07:02:29.670 --> 07:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
risk for that child going on to develop
 
07:02:32.310 --> 07:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
dental caries in adulthood
 
07:02:35.350 --> 07:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
additionally from a personal standpoint
 
07:02:37.590 --> 07:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
many of my patients
 
07:02:39.990 --> 07:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
have had to have these dental caries
 
07:02:43.030 --> 07:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
repaired which is a
 
07:02:45.670 --> 07:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
procedure that is generally done under
 
07:02:48.788 --> 07:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
general anesthesia which is
 
07:02:50.788 --> 07:02:50.798 align:start position:0%
both stressful for families and not
 
07:02:50.798 --> 07:02:51.830 align:start position:0%
both stressful for families and not
without

07:02:51.830 --> 07:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
without
 
07:02:51.840 --> 07:02:53.350 align:start position:0%
without
risk

07:02:53.350 --> 07:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
risk
 
07:02:53.360 --> 07:02:54.788 align:start position:0%
risk
fluoride

07:02:54.788 --> 07:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
fluoride
 
07:02:57.350 --> 07:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
is a very well studied
 
07:03:00.070 --> 07:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
treatment to prevent
 
07:03:01.990 --> 07:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
dental caries by
 
07:03:04.868 --> 07:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
promoting the mineralization of tooth
 
07:03:04.878 --> 07:03:06.070 align:start position:0%
promoting the mineralization of tooth
enamel

07:03:06.070 --> 07:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
enamel
 
07:03:08.390 --> 07:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
it works as mentioned previously by both
 
07:03:11.750 --> 07:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
topical and systemic roots
 
07:03:15.270 --> 07:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
community water fluoridation is
 
07:03:16.788 --> 07:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
an extremely
 
07:03:19.350 --> 07:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
effective method of
 
07:03:22.548 --> 07:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
reducing rates of dental caries
 
07:03:22.558 --> 07:03:24.230 align:start position:0%
reducing rates of dental caries
and

07:03:24.230 --> 07:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:03:26.230 --> 07:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
as previously mentioned this practice
 
07:03:29.990 --> 07:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
has been done since the 1940s all over
 
07:03:31.270 --> 07:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
the country
 
07:03:34.070 --> 07:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
and research shows that it reduces rates
 
07:03:36.708 --> 07:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
of dental caries in a community by 25
 
07:03:36.718 --> 07:03:39.750 align:start position:0%
of dental caries in a community by 25
percent

07:03:39.750 --> 07:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:42.628 --> 07:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
the american academy of pediatrics put
 
07:03:44.788 --> 07:03:44.798 align:start position:0%
out a
 
07:03:46.868 --> 07:03:46.878 align:start position:0%
clinical policy statement in december
 
07:03:50.468 --> 07:03:50.478 align:start position:0%
2020 renewing its standpoint inc in
 
07:03:51.990 --> 07:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
support of
 
07:03:54.548 --> 07:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
um the use of fluoride to prevent dental
 
07:03:57.590 --> 07:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
caries and noted in this report that
 
07:04:00.468 --> 07:04:00.478 align:start position:0%
there are over 3 000 studies
 
07:04:03.110 --> 07:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
looking at the impact of fluoride and
 
07:04:03.120 --> 07:04:04.390 align:start position:0%
looking at the impact of fluoride and
fluoridation

07:04:04.390 --> 07:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
fluoridation
 
07:04:07.750 --> 07:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
on various health health outcomes
 
07:04:10.230 --> 07:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
the only adverse event that has been
 
07:04:12.310 --> 07:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned in
 
07:04:15.110 --> 07:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
scientifically validated studies is this
 
07:04:15.120 --> 07:04:16.070 align:start position:0%
scientifically validated studies is this
risk

07:04:16.070 --> 07:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
risk
 
07:04:19.750 --> 07:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
of dental fluorosis which is a purely
 
07:04:21.910 --> 07:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
cosmetic outcome
 
07:04:24.230 --> 07:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
leading to some whitish lines on the
 
07:04:26.150 --> 07:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
teeth i don't mean to minimize that but
 
07:04:27.430 --> 07:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
it does not
 
07:04:27.440 --> 07:04:28.628 align:start position:0%
it does not
cause

07:04:28.628 --> 07:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
cause
 
07:04:31.750 --> 07:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
nearly the same health burden as
 
07:04:34.070 --> 07:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
dental caries itself which can lead to
 
07:04:36.150 --> 07:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
systemic infections and in some cases
 
07:04:38.708 --> 07:04:38.718 align:start position:0%
even death
 
07:04:41.590 --> 07:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
as uh karen craver noted
 
07:04:44.390 --> 07:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
community water fluoridation is one of
 
07:04:47.430 --> 07:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
the cdc's top public health achievements
 
07:04:50.150 --> 07:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the 20th century up there with
 
07:04:53.190 --> 07:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
vaccination as a very successful
 
07:04:57.030 --> 07:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
effective and safe public health effort
 
07:04:59.110 --> 07:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
07:05:01.270 --> 07:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
i and the members of the new hampshire
 
07:05:04.150 --> 07:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
chapter of the aap
 
07:05:05.830 --> 07:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
assert that
 
07:05:08.548 --> 07:05:08.558 align:start position:0%
community water fluoridation is a safe
 
07:05:10.548 --> 07:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
effective and extremely important public
 
07:05:12.868 --> 07:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
health effort and it would be a mistake
 
07:05:14.390 --> 07:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
to abolish it
 
07:05:32.310 --> 07:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:34.548 --> 07:05:34.558 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
07:05:34.558 --> 07:05:49.590 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
representatives

07:05:49.590 --> 07:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:52.868 --> 07:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
uh representative penny j
 
07:05:52.878 --> 07:05:54.230 align:start position:0%
uh representative penny j
yes

07:05:54.230 --> 07:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:05:55.350 --> 07:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
all right
 
07:06:03.270 --> 07:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:06.310 --> 07:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman and
 
07:06:07.750 --> 07:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody because i was
 
07:06:10.230 --> 07:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
sitting in those seats yesterday all day
 
07:06:12.548 --> 07:06:12.558 align:start position:0%
and you're probably hoping i'll be quick
 
07:06:14.628 --> 07:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
so i will
 
07:06:14.638 --> 07:06:15.430 align:start position:0%
so i will
um

07:06:15.430 --> 07:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:06:18.468 --> 07:06:18.478 align:start position:0%
i really support this bill and i thought
 
07:06:20.468 --> 07:06:20.478 align:start position:0%
nothing i say is going to be anywhere as
 
07:06:23.830 --> 07:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
impressive as what stuart cooper said
 
07:06:26.628 --> 07:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
where he cited study after study by the
 
07:06:30.948 --> 07:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
cdc and by the nih it's recent
 
07:06:33.030 --> 07:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
more recent than you know the 40 years
 
07:06:35.430 --> 07:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
they've been doing this or longer that
 
07:06:39.190 --> 07:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
show that they are now measuring dangers
 
07:06:42.390 --> 07:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
um and it's not just children that are
 
07:06:45.430 --> 07:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
affected the people for whom fluoride is
 
07:06:45.440 --> 07:06:46.830 align:start position:0%
affected the people for whom fluoride is
absolutely

07:06:46.830 --> 07:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
07:06:49.270 --> 07:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
poisonous are the ones
 
07:06:49.280 --> 07:06:50.310 align:start position:0%
poisonous are the ones
on

07:06:50.310 --> 07:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
07:06:52.948 --> 07:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
on a kidney dialysis
 
07:06:56.150 --> 07:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
i i used to drive a person to dialysis
 
07:06:58.310 --> 07:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
as a volunteer and i was reading the
 
07:07:00.708 --> 07:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
signs on the wall you should see the
 
07:07:03.110 --> 07:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
long list of just foods they are
 
07:07:05.590 --> 07:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to avoid because they have
 
07:07:05.600 --> 07:07:06.788 align:start position:0%
supposed to avoid because they have
fluoride

07:07:06.788 --> 07:07:06.798 align:start position:0%
fluoride
 
07:07:07.910 --> 07:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
in them
 
07:07:11.030 --> 07:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
so imagine how terrible it is for them
 
07:07:15.590 --> 07:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
to be exposed just in drinking water
 
07:07:17.750 --> 07:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
from our testimony today we've already
 
07:07:19.990 --> 07:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
heard that it's far more effective
 
07:07:21.910 --> 07:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
07:07:24.708 --> 07:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
it's far more effective to treat teeth
 
07:07:26.548 --> 07:07:26.558 align:start position:0%
with a topical
 
07:07:29.270 --> 07:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh treatment when people when kids go or
 
07:07:32.070 --> 07:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
adults go to have their teeth clean it's
 
07:07:35.910 --> 07:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
much more effective and the other uh
 
07:07:39.350 --> 07:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
statistics that show that fluoridation
 
07:07:41.590 --> 07:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
in water does not prevent kids from
 
07:07:44.628 --> 07:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
getting dental caries is the study
 
07:07:47.350 --> 07:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
comparing new hampshire to minnesota
 
07:07:50.150 --> 07:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
if minnesota has 90 percent 98
 
07:07:50.160 --> 07:07:51.990 align:start position:0%
if minnesota has 90 percent 98
fluoridation

07:07:51.990 --> 07:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
fluoridation
 
07:07:55.190 --> 07:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
and yet their dental caries rate is far
 
07:07:56.708 --> 07:07:56.718 align:start position:0%
higher than ours
 
07:07:58.788 --> 07:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
i think that's pretty good proof
 
07:08:01.030 --> 07:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
that it's not a guarantee that you're
 
07:08:03.510 --> 07:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
going to save kids by giving them
 
07:08:06.310 --> 07:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
fluoridated water the other concern is
 
07:08:08.390 --> 07:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know i you probably heard from me
 
07:08:08.400 --> 07:08:09.430 align:start position:0%
you know i you probably heard from me
about

07:08:09.430 --> 07:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:08:12.628 --> 07:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
vitamin d3 being protective and many
 
07:08:14.708 --> 07:08:14.718 align:start position:0%
times people have said to me oh you want
 
07:08:17.590 --> 07:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
to be careful you don't get too much
 
07:08:19.030 --> 07:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
well i tell them to go do their own
 
07:08:21.270 --> 07:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
research you know to get an idea what's
 
07:08:23.350 --> 07:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
too much but look at this if you're
 
07:08:27.270 --> 07:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
drinking water and fluorides in it
 
07:08:30.150 --> 07:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
how do you even have any idea
 
07:08:32.150 --> 07:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
what your dosage is
 
07:08:34.390 --> 07:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
especially for little kids you know
 
07:08:36.788 --> 07:08:36.798 align:start position:0%
because they're much more sensitive than
 
07:08:39.590 --> 07:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
adults because of their weight
 
07:08:41.910 --> 07:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot less to be
 
07:08:44.150 --> 07:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
damaging to them
 
07:08:46.868 --> 07:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
so i think um it's important to remember
 
07:08:49.670 --> 07:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
too that it's extremely difficult to
 
07:08:53.190 --> 07:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
remove fluoride from water that's why
 
07:08:55.670 --> 07:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
the people who are on
 
07:08:55.680 --> 07:08:57.110 align:start position:0%
the people who are on
dialysis

07:08:57.110 --> 07:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
dialysis
 
07:09:00.070 --> 07:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
are really up a creek because the
 
07:09:03.990 --> 07:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
dialysis itself cannot remove fluoride
 
07:09:07.750 --> 07:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's just too tiny an ion it is a little
 
07:09:10.868 --> 07:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
bitty chemical ion
 
07:09:12.150 --> 07:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
now i may have already covered
 
07:09:15.110 --> 07:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
everything i'm checking to make sure
 
07:09:15.120 --> 07:09:16.708 align:start position:0%
everything i'm checking to make sure
um

07:09:16.708 --> 07:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:18.070 --> 07:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't think we're going to
 
07:09:21.510 --> 07:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
increase dental expenses for medicaid at
 
07:09:21.520 --> 07:09:22.390 align:start position:0%
increase dental expenses for medicaid at
all

07:09:22.390 --> 07:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
all
 
07:09:24.708 --> 07:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
we should be saving money by not having
 
07:09:27.110 --> 07:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
to buy the fluoride to go in the water
 
07:09:29.350 --> 07:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for your
 
07:09:29.360 --> 07:09:30.468 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for your
attention

07:09:30.468 --> 07:09:30.478 align:start position:0%
attention
 
07:09:33.270 --> 07:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i hope that you consider that the
 
07:09:35.430 --> 07:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
most recent science
 
07:09:38.390 --> 07:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
is going to take a while to be adopted
 
07:09:41.030 --> 07:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
by the cdc and the nih even though they
 
07:09:43.670 --> 07:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
do the studies we all know
 
07:09:46.948 --> 07:09:46.958 align:start position:0%
how grindingly slow governmental
 
07:09:49.190 --> 07:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
agencies can act
 
07:09:54.390 --> 07:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:56.788 --> 07:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
representative bale for a question
 
07:09:59.270 --> 07:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
07:09:59.280 --> 07:10:00.868 align:start position:0%
representative gay
yes

07:10:00.868 --> 07:10:00.878 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:10:03.110 --> 07:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative bale
 
07:10:05.350 --> 07:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you mr chairman um thank
 
07:10:07.350 --> 07:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
you representative gay
 
07:10:09.590 --> 07:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to ask if you know someone
 
07:10:12.708 --> 07:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
with fluorosis
 
07:10:12.718 --> 07:10:13.510 align:start position:0%
with fluorosis
um

07:10:13.510 --> 07:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:10:15.990 --> 07:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
right now i'm not sure how extensive
 
07:10:18.310 --> 07:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
that is that the colored teeth or does
 
07:10:20.468 --> 07:10:20.478 align:start position:0%
that ex uh
 
07:10:23.270 --> 07:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
does that extend to all the damage that
 
07:10:26.310 --> 07:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
these people like who on kidney dialysis
 
07:10:29.510 --> 07:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
have they have bone problems too it can
 
07:10:34.390 --> 07:10:34.400 align:start position:0%

thank you um my name is gail brown and
 
07:11:30.070 --> 07:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
first of all i am not a scientist nor
 
07:11:32.230 --> 07:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to attempt to be one or to
 
07:11:34.548 --> 07:11:34.558 align:start position:0%
interpret science for you here today and
 
07:11:38.310 --> 07:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
i also put on my lipstick um so what i
 
07:11:40.868 --> 07:11:40.878 align:start position:0%
want to tell you is i am the director at
 
07:11:43.750 --> 07:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire oral health coalition
 
07:11:45.750 --> 07:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
and the coalition has been pulling
 
07:11:47.750 --> 07:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
together oral health
 
07:11:51.990 --> 07:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in new hampshire since 2002
 
07:11:55.110 --> 07:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
our membership includes
 
07:11:56.948 --> 07:11:56.958 align:start position:0%
many folks who do have a science
 
07:11:58.708 --> 07:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
background they include folks from the
 
07:12:01.350 --> 07:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
medical society from the nurse
 
07:12:03.750 --> 07:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
practitioner association from northeast
 
07:12:05.830 --> 07:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
delta dental department of health and
 
07:12:08.548 --> 07:12:08.558 align:start position:0%
human services um the
 
07:12:11.590 --> 07:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
dental allied training program at the
 
07:12:14.310 --> 07:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
tech the pediatric society i was
 
07:12:17.510 --> 07:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
thrilled to hear dr asano speaking
 
07:12:20.708 --> 07:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
by state primary care so we are
 
07:12:22.788 --> 07:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
we are large and we are
 
07:12:25.830 --> 07:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
we are very committed to oral health
 
07:12:28.390 --> 07:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
um what i would like to tell you today
 
07:12:30.310 --> 07:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
is that for many of those members they
 
07:12:33.030 --> 07:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
are part of national affiliates so our
 
07:12:35.270 --> 07:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
pediatric society is part of the
 
07:12:37.510 --> 07:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
american pediatric society the same with
 
07:12:40.390 --> 07:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
the medical society the dental society
 
07:12:44.070 --> 07:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
and we rely on those organizations and
 
07:12:46.390 --> 07:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
programs as well as the centers for
 
07:12:49.350 --> 07:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
disease control and prevention to
 
07:12:52.628 --> 07:12:52.638 align:start position:0%
interpret our science and to provide us
 
07:12:54.788 --> 07:12:54.798 align:start position:0%
with the platform that we can move
 
07:12:56.468 --> 07:12:56.478 align:start position:0%
forward to improve
 
07:12:58.070 --> 07:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
public health
 
07:12:58.080 --> 07:12:58.868 align:start position:0%
public health
so

07:12:58.868 --> 07:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:13:00.628 --> 07:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
i want to say to you that first and
 
07:13:03.510 --> 07:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
foremost we support community water
 
07:13:06.868 --> 07:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
fluoridation we have for years we we
 
07:13:09.750 --> 07:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
support a coordinated and really
 
07:13:12.788 --> 07:13:12.798 align:start position:0%
integrated fluoride program that helps
 
07:13:14.070 --> 07:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
people to
 
07:13:16.868 --> 07:13:16.878 align:start position:0%
be able to access both the systemic and
 
07:13:18.230 --> 07:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
the topical
 
07:13:20.468 --> 07:13:20.478 align:start position:0%
um use of fluoride that's the most
 
07:13:22.310 --> 07:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
scientific thing i'm going to say to you
 
07:13:24.868 --> 07:13:24.878 align:start position:0%
today i do want to point out a couple of
 
07:13:27.270 --> 07:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
things dr arsenau spoke on behalf of
 
07:13:29.910 --> 07:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
children she talked about the importance
 
07:13:32.310 --> 07:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
because tooth decay is a progressive
 
07:13:35.750 --> 07:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
infectious disease caused by bacteria it
 
07:13:38.708 --> 07:13:38.718 align:start position:0%
destroys teeth it impacts oral health
 
07:13:40.868 --> 07:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
but i want to say that is the same for
 
07:13:43.590 --> 07:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
adults as it is for children and is
 
07:13:45.750 --> 07:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
especially a problem for our senior
 
07:13:48.390 --> 07:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
citizens who in are in nursing home
 
07:13:50.070 --> 07:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
settings and for those of you who are
 
07:13:51.670 --> 07:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
just thinking about us talking about
 
07:13:53.350 --> 07:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
bacteria yes
 
07:13:57.430 --> 07:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
humans spread dental bacteria person to
 
07:13:59.670 --> 07:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
person to person okay
 
07:14:02.390 --> 07:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
so the it's important that we
 
07:14:05.750 --> 07:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
employ as many methods as we can
 
07:14:08.788 --> 07:14:08.798 align:start position:0%
untreated decay and dental disease can
 
07:14:10.548 --> 07:14:10.558 align:start position:0%
cause and if you've ever had dental pain
 
07:14:12.948 --> 07:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
you know why i'm using the word intense
 
07:14:15.750 --> 07:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
intense pain swelling broken teeth
 
07:14:18.468 --> 07:14:18.478 align:start position:0%
inflamed and bleeding gums this is why
 
07:14:21.030 --> 07:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation matters it can cause
 
07:14:23.750 --> 07:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
difficulty chewing and digesting impair
 
07:14:26.468 --> 07:14:26.478 align:start position:0%
people's speech and yes it can lead to
 
07:14:28.310 --> 07:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
death through infection
 
07:14:32.230 --> 07:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
it causes um very high medical treatment
 
07:14:34.548 --> 07:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
costs as well as dental costs you see
 
07:14:36.310 --> 07:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
people in the emergency room the
 
07:14:39.110 --> 07:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
operating room and hospital inpatient
 
07:14:41.830 --> 07:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
charges some of you have heard me say if
 
07:14:44.150 --> 07:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
you're not managing dental disease
 
07:14:46.070 --> 07:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
you're not managing health care and
 
07:14:49.270 --> 07:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
you're not managing it its costs
 
07:14:51.110 --> 07:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
so um i
 
07:14:52.390 --> 07:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
with um
 
07:14:53.910 --> 07:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
my colleagues who have said to you we
 
07:14:57.830 --> 07:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
have 60 to 70 70 plus years of of
 
07:15:00.548 --> 07:15:00.558 align:start position:0%
scientific information
 
07:15:03.190 --> 07:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
we are sticking to the platforms not of
 
07:15:06.070 --> 07:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
an individual physician or an individual
 
07:15:08.948 --> 07:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
nurse or an individual scientist we are
 
07:15:10.708 --> 07:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
sticking with the platforms that are
 
07:15:13.110 --> 07:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
being put forward by their professional
 
07:15:15.590 --> 07:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
associations the american medical
 
07:15:18.390 --> 07:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
association the american academy of
 
07:15:20.708 --> 07:15:20.718 align:start position:0%
pediatrics sorry my phone's ringing i
 
07:15:23.670 --> 07:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
must round somebody up
 
07:15:26.628 --> 07:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
the community water fluoride is easily
 
07:15:29.670 --> 07:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
adjusted it is low cost dr finney told
 
07:15:33.350 --> 07:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
you it would increase she is a dentist
 
07:15:35.430 --> 07:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
this is her job it would increase
 
07:15:37.430 --> 07:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
expenses here in the state
 
07:15:39.990 --> 07:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
at the local level and also at the
 
07:15:41.830 --> 07:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
county level remember i talked about
 
07:15:44.150 --> 07:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
care in nursing homes so my final
 
07:15:46.230 --> 07:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
statement is simply
 
07:15:48.310 --> 07:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
that in addition to all of this this
 
07:15:51.350 --> 07:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
legislation proposes a state mandate to
 
07:15:53.830 --> 07:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
overrule local voter controlled
 
07:15:57.270 --> 07:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
decisions about their own water supply
 
07:15:59.110 --> 07:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
that did not go far in previous
 
07:16:01.750 --> 07:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
legislation it's a very important point
 
07:16:03.670 --> 07:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
and we haven't addressed it yet today
 
07:16:05.990 --> 07:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents take great pride
 
07:16:09.190 --> 07:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
in home rule and this um
 
07:16:11.190 --> 07:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation goes against that
 
07:16:14.468 --> 07:16:14.478 align:start position:0%
and we ask you to vote in opposition
 
07:16:18.708 --> 07:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:20.628 --> 07:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm not gonna
 
07:16:23.830 --> 07:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna ask the uh uh
 
07:16:26.070 --> 07:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh the representatives for additional
 
07:16:28.070 --> 07:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
questions i think we've gotten
 
07:16:30.468 --> 07:16:30.478 align:start position:0%
i've been a whole i'm gonna uh ask
 
07:16:31.910 --> 07:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
unless they are
 
07:16:35.190 --> 07:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
really pressing questions i will ask the
 
07:16:35.200 --> 07:16:36.628 align:start position:0%
really pressing questions i will ask the
representatives

07:16:36.628 --> 07:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
07:16:39.350 --> 07:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
to refrain from additional questioning
 
07:16:41.190 --> 07:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
we have a lot to go through
 
07:16:42.948 --> 07:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
i want to limit some i'm going to be
 
07:16:42.958 --> 07:16:43.910 align:start position:0%
i want to limit some i'm going to be

07:19:04.548 --> 07:19:04.558 align:start position:0%
i'm a former deputy public health
 
07:19:06.788 --> 07:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
director for the city of manchester and
 
07:19:09.270 --> 07:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
a former state representative
 
07:19:13.110 --> 07:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
i'm here to oppose a house bill 611 fn
 
07:19:14.868 --> 07:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned in these new hampshire
 
07:19:16.310 --> 07:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
there are a number of municipalities
 
07:19:17.590 --> 07:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
that have voted through the local
 
07:19:19.670 --> 07:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
referendum to add florida to their water
 
07:19:21.830 --> 07:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
systems to protect their dental health
 
07:19:24.150 --> 07:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
of their families these communities did
 
07:19:28.230 --> 07:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
so under the provisions of rsa 485-14
 
07:19:31.110 --> 07:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
this statute also established the
 
07:19:33.190 --> 07:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
process for any community that wishes to
 
07:19:34.948 --> 07:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
remove fluoride from their public water
 
07:19:34.958 --> 07:19:35.990 align:start position:0%
remove fluoride from their public water
supply

07:19:35.990 --> 07:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
supply
 
07:19:38.708 --> 07:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
house bill 4 611 is an attempt by a
 
07:19:41.190 --> 07:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
small group of anti-fluoridation people
 
07:19:43.670 --> 07:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
to sidestep this process and have the
 
07:19:45.750 --> 07:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
legislature do for them what they were
 
07:19:48.270 --> 07:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
unable or unwilling to do on the rsa
 
07:19:50.708 --> 07:19:50.718 align:start position:0%
485-14 process
 
07:19:52.390 --> 07:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
they are asking the legislature to
 
07:19:54.788 --> 07:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
nullify the legal and fair elections and
 
07:19:57.350 --> 07:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
votes of thousands of people
 
07:19:59.110 --> 07:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
if there was such a large community
 
07:20:01.030 --> 07:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
opposition to fluoridation as the
 
07:20:02.868 --> 07:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
supporters claimed that it should be
 
07:20:05.350 --> 07:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
very easy for them to have fluoridation
 
07:20:07.990 --> 07:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
ended to referendum process
 
07:20:10.070 --> 07:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
the reality is however that support does
 
07:20:12.150 --> 07:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
not exist so they must use the
 
07:20:13.990 --> 07:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
legislative process to achieve their
 
07:20:14.000 --> 07:20:15.030 align:start position:0%
legislative process to achieve their
goal

07:20:15.030 --> 07:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
goal
 
07:20:17.350 --> 07:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
when people voted for fluoridation they
 
07:20:19.030 --> 07:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
were telling the government of their
 
07:20:21.190 --> 07:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
community what they wanted
 
07:20:23.910 --> 07:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
this legislation will negate the wishes
 
07:20:25.830 --> 07:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
of the people and result in the
 
07:20:27.510 --> 07:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
government telling these people what
 
07:20:29.990 --> 07:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
they can or cannot have
 
07:20:32.628 --> 07:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
this legislation is overreaching and big
 
07:20:34.548 --> 07:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
government at its worst
 
07:20:36.628 --> 07:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to note that of the
 
07:20:39.350 --> 07:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
seven sponsors only one of the sponsors
 
07:20:41.670 --> 07:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
it represents a community with community
 
07:20:43.910 --> 07:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation
 
07:20:46.070 --> 07:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
where are the the representatives of the
 
07:20:48.150 --> 07:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
communities that have water fluoridation
 
07:20:51.430 --> 07:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
opposing continuing water fluoridation
 
07:20:53.190 --> 07:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this bill has stated that
 
07:20:55.830 --> 07:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
the votes to approve fluoridation were
 
07:20:58.390 --> 07:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
won by narrow vote victories and their
 
07:21:00.628 --> 07:21:00.638 align:start position:0%
voter turnout was small this is not
 
07:21:00.638 --> 07:21:01.590 align:start position:0%
voter turnout was small this is not
accurate

07:21:01.590 --> 07:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
07:21:04.390 --> 07:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
in 1999 when manchester voted to approve
 
07:21:06.708 --> 07:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
fluoridation they also voted for their
 
07:21:09.190 --> 07:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
mayor during the same election
 
07:21:11.590 --> 07:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
mayor baines won the election and his
 
07:21:13.670 --> 07:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
margin of victory was almost identical
 
07:21:15.430 --> 07:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
to the margin of victory which florida
 
07:21:17.350 --> 07:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
was approved
 
07:21:19.110 --> 07:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
should the election of mayor baines be
 
07:21:20.628 --> 07:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
questioned because of his margin of
 
07:21:22.150 --> 07:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
victory and the number of voters who
 
07:21:24.468 --> 07:21:24.478 align:start position:0%
were voted i think not
 
07:21:26.150 --> 07:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
and when the manchester fluoridation
 
07:21:28.628 --> 07:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
question was repeated a few years later
 
07:21:30.468 --> 07:21:30.478 align:start position:0%
adding the other communities served by
 
07:21:32.708 --> 07:21:32.718 align:start position:0%
the manchester water system the margin
 
07:21:36.150 --> 07:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
of victory was even greater
 
07:21:38.788 --> 07:21:38.798 align:start position:0%
house bill 611 fn represents a very bad
 
07:21:41.030 --> 07:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
public health policy and is contrary to
 
07:21:43.670 --> 07:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
our basic democratic values
 
07:21:46.708 --> 07:21:46.718 align:start position:0%
i hope that you don't realize the nature
 
07:21:49.670 --> 07:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
of this attempt to undo the legal and
 
07:21:51.430 --> 07:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
safe votes of
 
07:21:54.150 --> 07:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
thousands of people over the last 50
 
07:21:55.830 --> 07:21:55.840 align:start position:0%

07:21:57.110 --> 07:21:57.120 align:start position:0%

you asked the question about other
 
07:22:04.548 --> 07:22:04.558 align:start position:0%
chemicals being added into the water
 
07:22:04.558 --> 07:22:05.830 align:start position:0%
chemicals being added into the water
supply

07:22:05.830 --> 07:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
supply
 
07:22:07.830 --> 07:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately you can get an answer
 
07:22:10.310 --> 07:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
but there are a host of other chemicals
 
07:22:12.548 --> 07:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
that are added to water supplies at the
 
07:22:14.468 --> 07:22:14.478 align:start position:0%

want to abolish fluoridation and water
 
07:26:31.030 --> 07:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
to come into the clinic and see what i

see on a daily basis
 
07:26:36.150 --> 07:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
when a child has a toothache as as young
 
07:26:38.468 --> 07:26:38.478 align:start position:0%
as two years old who's been crying up
 
07:26:39.830 --> 07:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
all night
 
07:26:42.230 --> 07:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
this is the only preventative
 
07:26:44.548 --> 07:26:44.558 align:start position:0%
way that some of these kids are getting
 
07:26:46.868 --> 07:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
care their parents can't take time off
 
07:26:50.708 --> 07:26:50.718 align:start position:0%
of work and come and get them treatment
 
07:26:53.110 --> 07:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
they can't afford to go and buy some of
 
07:26:54.948 --> 07:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
these toothpaste that are three or four
 
07:26:56.548 --> 07:26:56.558 align:start position:0%
or five dollars
 
07:26:58.948 --> 07:26:58.958 align:start position:0%
some of these patients are on a fixed

some of these patients are on a fixed
income

07:27:00.070 --> 07:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
income
 
07:27:03.110 --> 07:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
if you take away this water fluoridation
 
07:27:05.590 --> 07:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
these children have no chance
 
07:27:07.990 --> 07:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
no chance at all and the numbers will
 
07:27:11.510 --> 07:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
increase in the emergency room
 
07:27:15.350 --> 07:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
it will be a big big problem i i see it
 
07:27:17.830 --> 07:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
my heart breaks every day for a lot of
 
07:27:21.030 --> 07:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
these kids who have six-year molars
 
07:27:22.788 --> 07:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
at the age of seven who are already
 
07:27:25.510 --> 07:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
bombed out and have to be extracted
 
07:27:28.628 --> 07:27:28.638 align:start position:0%
because parents just can only do so much
 
07:27:30.868 --> 07:27:30.878 align:start position:0%
they can only buy a certain amount of
 
07:27:33.590 --> 07:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
things they go to the store or they can
 
07:27:35.190 --> 07:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
only afford
 
07:27:38.070 --> 07:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
so many things um and maybe
 
07:27:40.548 --> 07:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
buying preventative things for to
 
07:27:42.788 --> 07:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
prevent a cavity for these kids
 
07:27:44.070 --> 07:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
maybe isn't
 
07:27:45.590 --> 07:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
isn't what they can afford when they're
 
07:27:47.190 --> 07:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
07:27:48.868 --> 07:27:48.878 align:start position:0%

resident
 
07:29:42.468 --> 07:29:42.478 align:start position:0%
of dover new hampshire
 
07:29:45.110 --> 07:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
i moved to dover in 2014
 
07:29:47.910 --> 07:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
i fully understood that unfortunately
 
07:29:49.590 --> 07:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
the water was fluoridated and i wanted
 
07:29:51.110 --> 07:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
to tell you my story
 
07:29:53.350 --> 07:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
on my efforts to remove fluoride from
 
07:29:54.628 --> 07:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
the water
 
07:29:57.430 --> 07:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
well should i say my efforts to
 
07:30:00.070 --> 07:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
not ingest the fluoride from the water
 
07:30:02.388 --> 07:30:02.398 align:start position:0%
which began with
 
07:30:05.110 --> 07:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
a bottled water delivery service which
 
07:30:07.750 --> 07:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
as you know is fairly expensive but at
 
07:30:09.830 --> 07:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
the time when i looked at it seemed
 
07:30:12.070 --> 07:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
fairly reasonable given
 
07:30:13.510 --> 07:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
the luggage
 
07:30:14.868 --> 07:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
back and forth is that you know the
 
07:30:16.708 --> 07:30:16.718 align:start position:0%
other option would be lugging a jug from
 
07:30:18.070 --> 07:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
the supermarket
 
07:30:20.150 --> 07:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
so it started out somewhere around i
 
07:30:22.310 --> 07:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
want to say a dollar thirty a gallon
 
07:30:22.320 --> 07:30:23.430 align:start position:0%
want to say a dollar thirty a gallon
delivered

07:30:23.430 --> 07:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
07:30:25.110 --> 07:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't long within a few years
 
07:30:27.110 --> 07:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
before it was approaching two dollars a
 
07:30:27.120 --> 07:30:28.070 align:start position:0%
before it was approaching two dollars a
gallon

07:30:28.070 --> 07:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
gallon
 
07:30:29.590 --> 07:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
that started to be the breaking point
 
07:30:30.468 --> 07:30:30.478 align:start position:0%
for me
 
07:30:31.990 --> 07:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
so i started to look for some other
 
07:30:32.000 --> 07:30:34.150 align:start position:0%
so i started to look for some other
options

07:30:34.150 --> 07:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
options
 
07:30:36.388 --> 07:30:36.398 align:start position:0%
and i had a i had a water system or i
 
07:30:38.468 --> 07:30:38.478 align:start position:0%
have a cartridge filter system in my
 
07:30:39.910 --> 07:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
basement already
 
07:30:42.868 --> 07:30:42.878 align:start position:0%
um so it was ready to try something so
 
07:30:44.628 --> 07:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
what i did is i tried an activated
 
07:30:47.430 --> 07:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
aluminum cartridge which was about 200
 
07:30:50.310 --> 07:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
every six months if it worked but it
 
07:30:51.590 --> 07:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
didn't work
 
07:30:53.270 --> 07:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
the the flow rate on the whole house
 
07:30:55.030 --> 07:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
went down to about zero
 
07:30:57.670 --> 07:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
so back to the drawing board then i
 
07:31:01.350 --> 07:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
tried a bone char filter in the
 
07:31:04.310 --> 07:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
cartridge filter that would be about 130
 
07:31:06.150 --> 07:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
dollars every three months
 
07:31:07.910 --> 07:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
well i can't tell you whether or not
 
07:31:09.670 --> 07:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
that was affected because
 
07:31:11.270 --> 07:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
it leached into the system and all i
 
07:31:13.590 --> 07:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
could see was black in my water
 
07:31:16.628 --> 07:31:16.638 align:start position:0%
so and i tried twice and so that was a i
 
07:31:18.868 --> 07:31:18.878 align:start position:0%
guess a design failure and i can't
 
07:31:20.708 --> 07:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
understand how they sell them and i
 
07:31:22.388 --> 07:31:22.398 align:start position:0%
don't understand it but anyway i moved
 
07:31:23.830 --> 07:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
on from that
 
07:31:26.230 --> 07:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
so then i stepped up the stepped up the
 
07:31:28.230 --> 07:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
prices and stepped up the technology i
 
07:31:30.230 --> 07:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
went to an under the sink reverse
 
07:31:32.948 --> 07:31:32.958 align:start position:0%
osmosis system many people think that
 
07:31:34.948 --> 07:31:34.958 align:start position:0%
gets rid of fluoride
 
07:31:34.958 --> 07:31:36.388 align:start position:0%
gets rid of fluoride
well

07:31:36.388 --> 07:31:36.398 align:start position:0%
well
 
07:31:38.388 --> 07:31:38.398 align:start position:0%
four hundred dollars later i don't know
 
07:31:41.190 --> 07:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
how many hours installing it
 
07:31:43.830 --> 07:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
and here's the key to the people that
 
07:31:45.670 --> 07:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
that buy these ro systems that maybe
 
07:31:47.030 --> 07:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
they don't do
 
07:31:49.430 --> 07:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
you should check it afterwards i did it
 
07:31:51.750 --> 07:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
only knocked it down by 50 percent
 
07:31:54.070 --> 07:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
not good enough ripped it out got my
 
07:31:56.388 --> 07:31:56.398 align:start position:0%
money back that's the good news at that
 
07:31:58.708 --> 07:31:58.718 align:start position:0%
point i'm like what do i do now i'm
 
07:32:00.948 --> 07:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
lugging a jug again i mean i know how
 
07:32:02.868 --> 07:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
many gal 20 gallons a week because we
 
07:32:05.910 --> 07:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
cook and drink with it i mean a hassle
 
07:32:08.628 --> 07:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
expensive so what did i do i pulled out
 
07:32:10.708 --> 07:32:10.718 align:start position:0%
the big guns i finally gave up i bought
 
07:32:11.990 --> 07:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
a distiller
 
07:32:12.000 --> 07:32:13.670 align:start position:0%
a distiller
2500

07:32:13.670 --> 07:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
2500
 
07:32:16.468 --> 07:32:16.478 align:start position:0%
and a distiller absolutely takes it out
 
07:32:18.788 --> 07:32:18.798 align:start position:0%
takes out anything that that that you
 
07:32:20.150 --> 07:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
know doesn't boil
 
07:32:20.160 --> 07:32:21.110 align:start position:0%
know doesn't boil
and

07:32:21.110 --> 07:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:32:22.708 --> 07:32:22.718 align:start position:0%
uh that works but twenty five hundred
 
07:32:24.788 --> 07:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
dollars a hundred dollars a month of
 
07:32:27.830 --> 07:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
electricity bills to run it
 
07:32:29.750 --> 07:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance on top of that
 
07:32:32.948 --> 07:32:32.958 align:start position:0%
so uh so for for those of us that don't
 
07:32:35.750 --> 07:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
want this medication which is what it is
 
07:32:38.548 --> 07:32:38.558 align:start position:0%
uh it's very expensive and it requires a
 
07:32:41.270 --> 07:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
lot of maintenance and uh
 
07:32:43.830 --> 07:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
so the comment from miss kramer i
 
07:32:45.430 --> 07:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
believe it was that said that fluoride
 
07:32:47.830 --> 07:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't an additive and not medication
 
07:32:49.990 --> 07:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely incorrect
 
07:32:51.510 --> 07:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
and the gentleman spoke a few few
 
07:32:53.670 --> 07:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
minutes ago chlorine and all those other
 
07:32:55.670 --> 07:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
things that he was mentioning those are
 
07:32:57.830 --> 07:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
targeted at the water system they're
 
07:32:59.510 --> 07:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
additives because they're targeted at
 
07:33:01.670 --> 07:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
the water system fluoride who is it
 
07:33:04.468 --> 07:33:04.478 align:start position:0%
targeted it's targeting the user and so
 
07:33:04.478 --> 07:33:05.590 align:start position:0%
targeted it's targeting the user and so
therefore

07:33:05.590 --> 07:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
07:33:07.510 --> 07:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
it is medicine and that's why none of
 
07:33:09.190 --> 07:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
them will admit it that's why they're
 
07:33:10.788 --> 07:33:10.798 align:start position:0%
they're trying to they're trying to pull
 
07:33:12.468 --> 07:33:12.478 align:start position:0%
a fast one on all of you telling you
 
07:33:13.990 --> 07:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
that it's an additive
 
07:33:16.548 --> 07:33:16.558 align:start position:0%
chlorine chloramine those other things
 
07:33:19.350 --> 07:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
corrosion inhibitors those are additives
 
07:33:22.150 --> 07:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
for the water system not the water using
 
07:33:24.628 --> 07:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
user so i don't really know how this
 
07:33:27.190 --> 07:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
antiquated practice that
 
07:33:29.830 --> 07:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
is still in effect but it is and all i
 
07:33:32.230 --> 07:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
can say is that i think eventually
 
07:33:33.990 --> 07:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to be recognized for what it
 
07:33:34.000 --> 07:33:34.708 align:start position:0%
it's going to be recognized for what it
is

07:33:34.708 --> 07:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:33:37.270 --> 07:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
um and it's going to go the way of
 
07:33:39.030 --> 07:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
arsenic laced wood
 
07:33:41.110 --> 07:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
that we found on nearly every children's
 
07:33:42.708 --> 07:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
playground if you remember about 20
 
07:33:44.868 --> 07:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
years ago do you all remember that
 
07:33:46.468 --> 07:33:46.478 align:start position:0%
arsenic laced wooden children's
 
07:33:48.548 --> 07:33:48.558 align:start position:0%
playground it was on everywhere
 
07:33:50.708 --> 07:33:50.718 align:start position:0%
overnight it disappeared
 
07:33:52.310 --> 07:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it'll be an overnight
 
07:33:54.310 --> 07:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
thing but all i can tell you is that i
 
07:33:56.310 --> 07:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
think the truth will eventually prevail
 
07:33:59.270 --> 07:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
right now i urge all of you to support
 
07:34:02.548 --> 07:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
this bill thank you again one last thing
 
07:34:04.468 --> 07:34:04.478 align:start position:0%
the comment about big government
 
07:34:07.030 --> 07:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
big government at its worst
 
07:34:09.590 --> 07:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
how about forcing someone to take a
 
07:34:11.750 --> 07:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
medication they don't want i can't think
 
07:34:14.468 --> 07:34:14.478 align:start position:0%
of any worse example of big government
 
07:34:17.510 --> 07:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
at its worst thank you very much
 
07:34:20.548 --> 07:34:20.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr alley
 
07:34:22.230 --> 07:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
okay mr chair next i have on the list
 
07:34:25.670 --> 07:34:25.680 align:start position:0%

dental society
 
07:34:31.910 --> 07:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
and speaking in opposition to the bill
 
07:34:31.920 --> 07:34:34.070 align:start position:0%
and speaking in opposition to the bill
okay

07:34:34.070 --> 07:34:34.080 align:start position:0%

07:34:40.150 --> 07:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
i will plan to speak uh two to three
 
07:34:42.310 --> 07:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
minutes max i'm actually timing myself
 
07:34:43.750 --> 07:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
07:34:44.708 --> 07:34:44.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:34:46.230 --> 07:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is michael
 
07:34:47.830 --> 07:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
auerbach i'm the executive director of
 
07:34:49.910 --> 07:34:49.920 align:start position:0%

member dentists hygienists assistants
 
07:34:57.110 --> 07:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
and office staff i offer our vehement
 
07:34:59.190 --> 07:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
opposition to this dangerous bill
 
07:35:01.670 --> 07:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
this legislation seeks to without cause
 
07:35:04.070 --> 07:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
or imperative override municipal
 
07:35:06.548 --> 07:35:06.558 align:start position:0%
government's decision-making processes
 
07:35:09.110 --> 07:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
regarding community water fluoridation
 
07:35:11.510 --> 07:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
more importantly it threatens the public
 
07:35:13.590 --> 07:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
oral health of new hampshire's residents
 
07:35:15.270 --> 07:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
especially children
 
07:35:17.590 --> 07:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
210 million americans currently
 
07:35:19.590 --> 07:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
including 300 000 new hampshire
 
07:35:21.670 --> 07:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
residents currently receive the the
 
07:35:23.510 --> 07:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
health benefits of this practice
 
07:35:25.430 --> 07:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
according to a wide range of studies as
 
07:35:27.750 --> 07:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
cited by the american dental association
 
07:35:30.388 --> 07:35:30.398 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation prevents about 25
 
07:35:32.230 --> 07:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
percent of tooth decay in both children
 
07:35:32.240 --> 07:35:32.948 align:start position:0%
percent of tooth decay in both children
and

07:35:32.948 --> 07:35:32.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:35:35.030 --> 07:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
adults over the last few days you've
 
07:35:37.110 --> 07:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
received countless studies and documents
 
07:35:39.030 --> 07:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire dental society
 
07:35:41.270 --> 07:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
these are science-based documents to
 
07:35:43.510 --> 07:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
help you deliberate your vote
 
07:35:44.868 --> 07:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill would have you
 
07:35:46.388 --> 07:35:46.398 align:start position:0%
believe that community water
 
07:35:48.150 --> 07:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
fluoridation causes amongst other
 
07:35:50.868 --> 07:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
ailments cancer neurological disorders
 
07:35:53.430 --> 07:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
birth defects and reductions in iqs
 
07:35:55.590 --> 07:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
for the record no legitimate study to
 
07:35:57.350 --> 07:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
date has laid community water
 
07:35:59.590 --> 07:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
fluoridation as we have described today
 
07:36:02.310 --> 07:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
to such health and developmental issues
 
07:36:03.750 --> 07:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
the data provided by the bill's
 
07:36:05.910 --> 07:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
proponents such as studies in child
 
07:36:07.990 --> 07:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
development in mexico and canada have
 
07:36:10.388 --> 07:36:10.398 align:start position:0%
largely been disproven
 
07:36:13.430 --> 07:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
according to the new according to um
 
07:36:15.190 --> 07:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i'm sorry we leave the
 
07:36:17.990 --> 07:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
decision making right up to the public
 
07:36:20.388 --> 07:36:20.398 align:start position:0%
as to whether to
 
07:36:22.708 --> 07:36:22.718 align:start position:0%
engage in cleanly water fluoridation
 
07:36:24.310 --> 07:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
the proponents of this bill acknowledge
 
07:36:25.990 --> 07:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
this fact and acknowledge that they seek
 
07:36:28.310 --> 07:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill because the same
 
07:36:30.310 --> 07:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
time honored and sound municipal ballot
 
07:36:32.548 --> 07:36:32.558 align:start position:0%
system has not worked in their favor
 
07:36:34.628 --> 07:36:34.638 align:start position:0%
residents have by and large chosen not
 
07:36:35.990 --> 07:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
to revisit the community water
 
07:36:37.990 --> 07:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
fluoridation programs on the ballot
 
07:36:39.590 --> 07:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
because they have not experienced any
 
07:36:39.600 --> 07:36:40.548 align:start position:0%
because they have not experienced any
problems

07:36:40.548 --> 07:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
problems
 
07:36:43.190 --> 07:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is a solution to an issue no

one in the affected communities is

my name is dr valerie fraser i'm also a
 
07:38:16.150 --> 07:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
former two-term state representative i
 
07:38:17.910 --> 07:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
served on a commerce committee and was
 
07:38:19.510 --> 07:38:19.520 align:start position:0%

611

07:38:23.430 --> 07:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
611
 
07:38:25.750 --> 07:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
i do support the idea of abolishing
 
07:38:28.388 --> 07:38:28.398 align:start position:0%
fluoride in the waters in new hampshire
 
07:38:29.910 --> 07:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of interesting
 
07:38:32.310 --> 07:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
conversations and interesting testimony
 
07:38:32.320 --> 07:38:33.350 align:start position:0%
conversations and interesting testimony
today

07:38:33.350 --> 07:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:38:35.750 --> 07:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
um but the bottom line for me and i
 
07:38:37.750 --> 07:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
think uh it would be
 
07:38:40.310 --> 07:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
very good to take heart to this is it
 
07:38:42.708 --> 07:38:42.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter how many certificates you
 
07:38:46.070 --> 07:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
have uh how how what how big an
 
07:38:48.788 --> 07:38:48.798 align:start position:0%
organization you belong to
 
07:38:51.190 --> 07:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
none of that matters it is a chemical
 
07:38:53.110 --> 07:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
that is being introduced into the water
 
07:38:53.120 --> 07:38:54.230 align:start position:0%
that is being introduced into the water
supply

07:38:54.230 --> 07:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
supply
 
07:38:57.430 --> 07:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
and with the complete inability it is a
 
07:38:59.590 --> 07:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
drug the fda
 
07:39:02.628 --> 07:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
is uh designates it as a drug
 
07:39:04.788 --> 07:39:04.798 align:start position:0%
that you cannot control the dose in the
 
07:39:07.110 --> 07:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
water and we know that has effects on
 
07:39:07.120 --> 07:39:08.150 align:start position:0%
water and we know that has effects on
infants

07:39:08.150 --> 07:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
infants
 
07:39:09.430 --> 07:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
they're not supposed to mix their
 
07:39:12.468 --> 07:39:12.478 align:start position:0%
formula with it and it does have long
 
07:39:15.110 --> 07:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
lasting health effects
 
07:39:17.590 --> 07:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
as a veterinarian if a small dog were to
 
07:39:19.750 --> 07:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
consume a tube of toothpaste he would
 
07:39:22.708 --> 07:39:22.718 align:start position:0%
die it is a toxin and i remember the
 
07:39:25.670 --> 07:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
time when children's toothpaste did not
 
07:39:27.750 --> 07:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
have fluoride in it because it was toxic
 
07:39:29.910 --> 07:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
and there was fear that because babies
 
07:39:29.920 --> 07:39:31.350 align:start position:0%
and there was fear that because babies
swallow

07:39:31.350 --> 07:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
swallow
 
07:39:32.628 --> 07:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
you know whatever you put in their mouth
 
07:39:35.030 --> 07:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
they swallow it that they would become
 
07:39:37.350 --> 07:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
poisoned by it
 
07:39:39.590 --> 07:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
the other point is that fluoride has an
 
07:39:41.510 --> 07:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
affinity for the thyroid the breast and
 
07:39:43.270 --> 07:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
the uterus and those are the three most
 
07:39:45.590 --> 07:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
common cancers that women get
 
07:39:47.590 --> 07:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
just about everybody i know as we get
 
07:39:49.590 --> 07:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
older has osteoarthritis that's also
 
07:39:51.750 --> 07:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
been linked to fluoride so there are
 
07:39:54.468 --> 07:39:54.478 align:start position:0%
far-reaching health aspects to it it is
 
07:39:57.270 --> 07:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
a drug it there's no way to control it
 
07:40:01.670 --> 07:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
in the water and if a person wants to
 
07:40:03.590 --> 07:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
in in conjunction with their visit to
 
07:40:05.830 --> 07:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
their dentist if they want to use
 
07:40:07.750 --> 07:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
fluoride it can be done easily through
 
07:40:10.628 --> 07:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
toothpaste fluoride pills
 
07:40:13.030 --> 07:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
or fluoride treatment on the teeth
 
07:40:15.110 --> 07:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
but to make the other half of society
 
07:40:17.190 --> 07:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
that does not want to have medication
 
07:40:18.788 --> 07:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
forced down their throat as one
 
07:40:20.230 --> 07:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
gentleman said
 
07:40:22.548 --> 07:40:22.558 align:start position:0%
uh it would be best to support this bill
 
07:40:24.948 --> 07:40:24.958 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman i wish you speak
 
07:42:34.708 --> 07:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
for three minutes
 
07:42:36.948 --> 07:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman
 
07:42:38.230 --> 07:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
07:42:40.150 --> 07:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
thomas mcleod i am a resident of mount
 
07:42:42.150 --> 07:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
vernon new hampshire testifying today as
 
07:42:44.230 --> 07:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
a member of the public thank you for
 
07:42:46.310 --> 07:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony in support of this
 
07:42:46.320 --> 07:42:47.430 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony in support of this

bill
 
07:42:48.708 --> 07:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
members of the committee water
 
07:42:51.590 --> 07:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
fluoridation however well-intentioned is
 
07:42:54.230 --> 07:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
in fact a preventative medical treatment
 
07:42:56.788 --> 07:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
delivered via public water supplies
 
07:42:59.270 --> 07:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
after all water does not get cavities
 
07:43:00.468 --> 07:43:00.478 align:start position:0%
people do
 
07:43:02.388 --> 07:43:02.398 align:start position:0%
there are currently no statutes that
 
07:43:04.948 --> 07:43:04.958 align:start position:0%
require towns to notify citizens that
 
07:43:07.510 --> 07:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
the water contains a medical agent nor
 
07:43:09.430 --> 07:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
any that require towns to explain the
 
07:43:11.990 --> 07:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
risks and benefits of such therefore
 
07:43:14.388 --> 07:43:14.398 align:start position:0%
there is effectively no informed consent
 
07:43:16.788 --> 07:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
to this treatment furthermore delivering
 
07:43:18.388 --> 07:43:18.398 align:start position:0%
a treatment through the public water
 
07:43:20.548 --> 07:43:20.558 align:start position:0%
supply is inherently fraught with wet
 
07:43:23.030 --> 07:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
risks first and foremost there is no way
 
07:43:24.948 --> 07:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
to control the dosage
 
07:43:26.708 --> 07:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
after the water leaves the treatment
 
07:43:29.510 --> 07:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
plant to illustrate one problem assuming
 
07:43:31.110 --> 07:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
that the concentration of fluoride
 
07:43:32.868 --> 07:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
leaving the plant is correct and that's
 
07:43:35.110 --> 07:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
a big assumption assumption
 
07:43:37.590 --> 07:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
consumers do not necessarily drink water
 
07:43:39.510 --> 07:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
out of the tap as is
 
07:43:41.430 --> 07:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
tap water is used for cooking and food
 
07:43:43.590 --> 07:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
preparation where it may be boiled down
 
07:43:45.830 --> 07:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
thus increasing the actual concentration
 
07:43:47.670 --> 07:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
of this medical agent
 
07:43:49.990 --> 07:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
that the consumer receives on the other
 
07:43:52.150 --> 07:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
hand people who primarily drink bottled
 
07:43:55.030 --> 07:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
water receive virtually no flow rate at
 
07:43:55.040 --> 07:43:56.230 align:start position:0%
water receive virtually no flow rate at
all

07:43:56.230 --> 07:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
all
 
07:43:58.150 --> 07:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
responding to early testimony that
 
07:44:00.388 --> 07:44:00.398 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony that
 
07:44:02.230 --> 07:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation is not a medical
 
07:44:02.240 --> 07:44:03.270 align:start position:0%
water fluoridation is not a medical
treatment

07:44:03.270 --> 07:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
07:44:05.830 --> 07:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
normally the amount of fluoride in water
 
07:44:07.430 --> 07:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
is trace
 
07:44:09.510 --> 07:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's naturally occurring fluoride less
 
07:44:10.948 --> 07:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
than 0.2
 
07:44:13.990 --> 07:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
or most often less than 0.1 milligrams
 
07:44:17.510 --> 07:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
per liter the therapeutic dose is now
 
07:44:20.468 --> 07:44:20.478 align:start position:0%
0.7 milligrams per liter and as they say
 
07:44:22.468 --> 07:44:22.478 align:start position:0%
the dose makes the medicine
 
07:44:23.910 --> 07:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore there is a difference
 
07:44:25.830 --> 07:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
between the naturally occurring compound
 
07:44:28.628 --> 07:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
which is usually calcium fluoride and
 
07:44:30.388 --> 07:44:30.398 align:start position:0%
the water supplement which is generally
 
07:44:32.868 --> 07:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
phosphate fertilizer scrubber waste
 
07:44:34.708 --> 07:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
converted to a compound
 
07:44:34.718 --> 07:44:37.830 align:start position:0%
converted to a compound
called

07:44:37.830 --> 07:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:37.840 --> 07:44:39.110 align:start position:0%
 
acid

07:44:39.110 --> 07:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
acid
 
07:44:41.990 --> 07:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
essentially an industrial waste product
 
07:44:43.830 --> 07:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh on a personal note members of the
 
07:44:47.110 --> 07:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
committee in 2003 my daughter had at age
 
07:44:48.548 --> 07:44:48.558 align:start position:0%
20 months
 
07:44:51.350 --> 07:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
fluorosis so severe that several of her
 
07:44:53.430 --> 07:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
primary teeth had to be removed under
 
07:44:55.510 --> 07:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
general anesthesia
 
07:44:57.590 --> 07:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
our dentist confirmed through laboratory
 
07:44:59.590 --> 07:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
tests that the cause of the destruction
 
07:45:02.230 --> 07:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
of her teeth was indeed over consumption
 
07:45:03.430 --> 07:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
of fluoride
 
07:45:05.350 --> 07:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
at the time we were not notified that
 
07:45:07.030 --> 07:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
our drinking water contained added
 
07:45:09.430 --> 07:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
fluoride therefore we took no action to
 
07:45:11.030 --> 07:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
mitigate the risk
 
07:45:13.590 --> 07:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
now at age 18 the gap left by my
 
07:45:16.150 --> 07:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
daughter's previously removed teeth have
 
07:45:19.190 --> 07:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
left left her with serious orthodontic
 
07:45:21.510 --> 07:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
problems however the community that
 
07:45:23.190 --> 07:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
treated her with fluoride without
 
07:45:25.350 --> 07:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
informed consent now takes no
 
07:45:27.670 --> 07:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the damage this
 
07:45:30.150 --> 07:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
treatment caused nor the orthodontic
 
07:45:33.430 --> 07:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
expenses she faces
 
07:45:34.468 --> 07:45:34.478 align:start position:0%

my daughter was denied her human right

jonathan alley from nhdes
 
07:46:24.230 --> 07:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me
 
07:46:26.708 --> 07:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
yes how long do you wish to speak i will
 
07:46:28.230 --> 07:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
try to keep it under two minutes for you
 
07:46:30.230 --> 07:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
i recognize we're close to five o'clock
 
07:46:30.240 --> 07:46:31.110 align:start position:0%
i recognize we're close to five o'clock
okay

07:46:31.110 --> 07:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:46:32.230 --> 07:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
you're right hi
 
07:46:34.070 --> 07:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
hello my name is dr jonathan ali and i'm
 
07:46:35.350 --> 07:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
the toxicologist of the new hampshire
 
07:46:37.030 --> 07:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services my
 
07:46:39.750 --> 07:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
role at des is to evaluate chemicals and
 
07:46:42.150 --> 07:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
their risk and what they risk those pose
 
07:46:43.910 --> 07:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
to human health
 
07:46:45.910 --> 07:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm not testifying today in support
 
07:46:47.910 --> 07:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
of opposition of the bill i am just here
 
07:46:50.868 --> 07:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
today to explain that at des we do
 
07:46:52.868 --> 07:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
evaluate the risk of chemicals and we
 
07:46:55.670 --> 07:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
try to do this in a consistent fashion
 
07:46:58.708 --> 07:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
looking at whatever science is available
 
07:47:00.788 --> 07:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
in my position i have to evaluate
 
07:47:02.388 --> 07:47:02.398 align:start position:0%
science that comes from groups that
 
07:47:03.910 --> 07:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
either are for or against certain
 
07:47:05.990 --> 07:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
chemicals and i have to look at that as
 
07:47:08.388 --> 07:47:08.398 align:start position:0%
a whole i also look at international
 
07:47:11.430 --> 07:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
national studies to do this kind of work
 
07:47:13.350 --> 07:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
as it relates to fluoride there have
 
07:47:15.430 --> 07:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
been recent studies that have looked at
 
07:47:17.590 --> 07:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
potential health effects of fluoride and
 
07:47:19.750 --> 07:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
this has been a mixed body of literature
 
07:47:21.830 --> 07:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
um as based on current testimony that
 
07:47:24.070 --> 07:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
i've heard today it sounds like your
 
07:47:26.388 --> 07:47:26.398 align:start position:0%
inboxes are going to be inundated with
 
07:47:28.788 --> 07:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
studies from both sides i will say that
 
07:47:31.430 --> 07:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
the most recent attempt to coalesce all
 
07:47:34.548 --> 07:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
this information in a systematic fashion
 
07:47:36.788 --> 07:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
did conclude that at the levels we
 
07:47:38.548 --> 07:47:38.558 align:start position:0%
fluoridate drinking water
 
07:47:41.750 --> 07:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
there is no health risk
 
07:47:43.990 --> 07:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
so again that is at the levels that we
 
07:47:45.910 --> 07:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
do fluoridate water they've concluded
 
07:47:47.830 --> 07:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
that there's not a health risk
 
07:47:50.310 --> 07:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
the group that did this is with the cdc
 
07:47:52.070 --> 07:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's called the national toxicology
 
07:47:54.708 --> 07:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
program and this recent work is still
 
07:47:56.310 --> 07:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
under review because there were
 
07:47:58.150 --> 07:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
methodological issues with how they
 
07:47:59.510 --> 07:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
looked at it
 
07:48:02.070 --> 07:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
the same group was the one that referred
 
07:48:04.150 --> 07:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
to this as being a developmental
 
07:48:06.150 --> 07:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
neurotoxin as some of the people
 
07:48:07.750 --> 07:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
testified today
 
07:48:09.830 --> 07:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
but again even as our last person who
 
07:48:12.788 --> 07:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
spoke mentioned it is at higher doses
 
07:48:15.590 --> 07:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
than what we see with coordination
 
07:48:16.868 --> 07:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
i recognize that all of you are looking
 
07:48:18.708 --> 07:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
at a very complicated situation of
 
07:48:21.030 --> 07:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
judging benefit versus risk and i just
 
07:48:22.708 --> 07:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
want you to understand that
 
07:48:24.150 --> 07:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
you have state programs that are here to
 
07:48:26.388 --> 07:48:26.398 align:start position:0%
help you with understanding that but
 
07:48:28.388 --> 07:48:28.398 align:start position:0%
also recognize that when toxicology
 
07:48:30.230 --> 07:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
studies do evaluate the risk of these
 
07:48:33.190 --> 07:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
chemicals they often exclude analysis of
 
07:48:33.200 --> 07:48:34.708 align:start position:0%
chemicals they often exclude analysis of
benefit

07:48:34.708 --> 07:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
07:48:36.788 --> 07:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
so with that i just want to remind you
 
07:48:38.468 --> 07:48:38.478 align:start position:0%
all that the state resources are here to
 
07:48:40.310 --> 07:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
help you out if you have questions about
 
07:48:42.388 --> 07:48:42.398 align:start position:0%
how we evaluate risk how we determine
 
07:48:44.548 --> 07:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
drinking water levels and what's safe
 
07:48:46.468 --> 07:48:46.478 align:start position:0%
for everyone in our population from the
 
07:48:48.948 --> 07:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
elderly to infants our program is here
 
07:48:51.190 --> 07:48:51.200 align:start position:0%

neutral
 
07:49:03.750 --> 07:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
so position okay
 
07:49:09.030 --> 07:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:11.510 --> 07:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
07:49:15.510 --> 07:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:15.520 --> 07:49:16.788 align:start position:0%
 
hello

07:49:16.788 --> 07:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
hello
 
07:49:21.510 --> 07:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:23.830 --> 07:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
i plan to speak for about three minutes
 
07:49:26.070 --> 07:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh could you make it smaller less we're
 
07:49:28.388 --> 07:49:28.398 align:start position:0%
almost out of time
 
07:49:30.150 --> 07:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely i'll try my best here i'll
 
07:49:32.070 --> 07:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
get going now
 
07:49:33.990 --> 07:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay my name is lori rosado i'm a
 
07:49:35.750 --> 07:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
resident in a general dentist serving
 
07:49:38.070 --> 07:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
the greater concord area i'm here today
 
07:49:40.150 --> 07:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill
 
07:49:41.830 --> 07:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
in addition to my role as a general
 
07:49:43.910 --> 07:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
dentist in the area of concord i'm also
 
07:49:45.670 --> 07:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
actively involved in the concord sealant
 
07:49:47.430 --> 07:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
coalition which is a non-profit
 
07:49:47.440 --> 07:49:48.788 align:start position:0%
coalition which is a non-profit
organization

07:49:48.788 --> 07:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
organization
 
07:49:50.388 --> 07:49:50.398 align:start position:0%
dedicated to providing care to
 
07:49:53.590 --> 07:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
underserved children throughout the area
 
07:49:55.670 --> 07:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
concord's fluoridated water is
 
07:49:57.270 --> 07:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
definitely helping making a difference
 
07:49:59.270 --> 07:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
between the young patients that i serve
 
07:50:01.510 --> 07:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
here in my practice as well as the kids
 
07:50:03.590 --> 07:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
that the program that i'm a part of
 
07:50:05.270 --> 07:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
treats in the schools
 
07:50:06.788 --> 07:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
it's the difference between children
 
07:50:09.030 --> 07:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
needing a routine cleaning every year
 
07:50:12.468 --> 07:50:12.478 align:start position:0%
and kids needing extensive and expensive
 
07:50:12.478 --> 07:50:13.830 align:start position:0%
and kids needing extensive and expensive
treatment

07:50:13.830 --> 07:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
07:50:16.388 --> 07:50:16.398 align:start position:0%
um you have to remember not every child
 
07:50:19.350 --> 07:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
has the opportunity for topical fluoride
 
07:50:21.030 --> 07:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's through the toothpaste
 
07:50:22.708 --> 07:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
through a dental visit
 
07:50:24.388 --> 07:50:24.398 align:start position:0%
even the programs we do in the schools
 
07:50:26.868 --> 07:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
they don't all come to see us so this is
 
07:50:28.868 --> 07:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
why children need that source in
 
07:50:30.548 --> 07:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
community water
 
07:50:32.708 --> 07:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
as a dentist in patients of all ages i
 
07:50:35.350 --> 07:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
can honestly say my over 30 years of
 
07:50:37.830 --> 07:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
practicing i've not seen the examples of
 
07:50:40.150 --> 07:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
fluorosis and other conditions that this
 
07:50:42.310 --> 07:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
bill sponsors claims are happening here
 
07:50:44.070 --> 07:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and i've also practiced
 
07:50:46.548 --> 07:50:46.558 align:start position:0%
in other states have not seen these
 
07:50:48.230 --> 07:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
severe conditions
 
07:50:50.708 --> 07:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
you can have fluorosis in teeth when
 
07:50:53.190 --> 07:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
they quote that 41 percent percent
 
07:50:53.200 --> 07:50:54.388 align:start position:0%
they quote that 41 percent percent
statistic

07:50:54.388 --> 07:50:54.398 align:start position:0%
statistic
 
07:50:55.990 --> 07:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
you have to realize they're also talking
 
07:50:58.230 --> 07:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
about one little spot on a tooth i have
 
07:50:59.750 --> 07:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
one in my own mouth and one of my back
 
07:51:01.190 --> 07:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
molars i've got a little spot on my
 
07:51:02.868 --> 07:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
tooth it's been totally fine it doesn't
 
07:51:04.868 --> 07:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
hurt my mouth at all i can tell you the
 
07:51:06.388 --> 07:51:06.398 align:start position:0%
majority of the people on this call
 
07:51:08.070 --> 07:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
probably have those spots somewhere in
 
07:51:09.670 --> 07:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
their mouth and they would have been
 
07:51:11.190 --> 07:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
part of that 41
 
07:51:13.190 --> 07:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
statistic that's quoted
 
07:51:15.190 --> 07:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
um when they did this in the adolescent
 
07:51:15.200 --> 07:51:16.310 align:start position:0%
um when they did this in the adolescent
study

07:51:16.310 --> 07:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
study
 
07:51:19.110 --> 07:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
so it you know fluorosis is not the be
 
07:51:21.590 --> 07:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
all end-all of a tooth
 
07:51:24.548 --> 07:51:24.558 align:start position:0%
and you know they also quoted the
 
07:51:26.468 --> 07:51:26.478 align:start position:0%
numbers of children
 
07:51:28.548 --> 07:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
having fluorosis as going up well you
 
07:51:29.750 --> 07:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
have to realize that you know the
 
07:51:31.670 --> 07:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
population is increasing
 
07:51:33.750 --> 07:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
and we're extracting less tea the less
 
07:51:35.350 --> 07:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
teeth we pull the more teeth we're going
 
07:51:37.510 --> 07:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
to see that may have a spot on
 
07:51:39.750 --> 07:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
so you know the science is rather simple
 
07:51:41.430 --> 07:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
on this and
 
07:51:43.590 --> 07:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
it just needs to be read thoroughly
 
07:51:46.150 --> 07:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
and the safety and efficacy of fluoride
 
07:51:48.548 --> 07:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
is undoubtedly
 
07:51:48.558 --> 07:51:49.430 align:start position:0%
is undoubtedly
safe

07:51:49.430 --> 07:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
safe
 
07:51:51.350 --> 07:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
and very effective
 
07:51:53.270 --> 07:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
and you could even leave cost out of
 
07:51:55.190 --> 07:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
this we could say let's not talk about
 
07:51:57.030 --> 07:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
costs yes it's gonna save you know
 
07:51:58.628 --> 07:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
medicaid and other organizations
 
07:52:00.868 --> 07:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of dollars but
 
07:52:03.030 --> 07:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
leave cost out of it
 
07:52:04.388 --> 07:52:04.398 align:start position:0%
it's safe
 
07:52:06.150 --> 07:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
we should want this for our children and
 
07:52:09.190 --> 07:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
for everybody i want it for myself
 
07:52:10.948 --> 07:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
um other things that were mentioned
 
07:52:13.430 --> 07:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
fluoride as a neurotoxin
 
07:52:15.670 --> 07:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
in unsafe levels yes
 
07:52:17.430 --> 07:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
just like everything else it is a
 
07:52:20.150 --> 07:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
neurotoxin but in the doses that we put
 
07:52:23.030 --> 07:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
in the community water it is very very
 
07:52:25.830 --> 07:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
safe there is absolutely no doubt in my
 
07:52:28.388 --> 07:52:28.398 align:start position:0%
mind how safe fluoride in our community
 
07:52:31.030 --> 07:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:33.750 --> 07:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
another mention earlier was um in canada
 
07:52:35.510 --> 07:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
they are fluoridating the urban areas of
 
07:52:37.030 --> 07:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
canada i have dental friends that
 
07:52:38.868 --> 07:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
practice in canada and the community
 
07:52:41.430 --> 07:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
urban areas of canada are fluoridated
 
07:52:43.110 --> 07:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
they have the same issues here there are
 
07:52:44.948 --> 07:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
people there that are against it and
 
07:52:46.708 --> 07:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
they have you know each municipality
 
07:52:49.430 --> 07:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
deciding it you know it's it's no
 
07:52:50.868 --> 07:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
different anywhere else in the world
 
07:52:52.628 --> 07:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
they know it's safe and the dental
 
07:52:55.510 --> 07:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
professionals and um you know pediatric
 
07:52:58.150 --> 07:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
dentists pediatricians in canada
 
07:52:59.590 --> 07:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
are in
 
07:53:01.350 --> 07:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
are not in opposition to fluoride they
 
07:53:03.510 --> 07:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
want the fluoride in the water as well
 
07:53:04.948 --> 07:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
um you know i want to be here as a
 
07:53:06.388 --> 07:53:06.398 align:start position:0%
resource for everybody at the end of
 
07:53:08.468 --> 07:53:08.478 align:start position:0%
today's call and conclusion to this
 
07:53:10.468 --> 07:53:10.478 align:start position:0%
please feel free to reach out to the
 
07:53:12.628 --> 07:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
dental society or any of your local
 
07:53:15.270 --> 07:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
dentists to speak with them because
 
07:53:16.708 --> 07:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
you know it should be a partnership we
 
07:53:19.030 --> 07:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
should build this decision together we
 
07:53:21.990 --> 07:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
should build it mostly in the safe
 
07:53:24.230 --> 07:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know knowing that how safe it is and
 
07:53:25.910 --> 07:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
and what we can do for our children to
 
07:53:27.670 --> 07:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
protect them
 
07:53:29.590 --> 07:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
from having the damage to their teeth
 
07:53:31.350 --> 07:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
that many of our older population are
 
07:53:33.270 --> 07:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
suffering from today

dentist uh
 
07:54:20.230 --> 07:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
in uh 30 years of practicing
 
07:54:21.830 --> 07:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
close to
 
07:54:24.868 --> 07:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
90 hundred thousand patient visits
 
07:54:25.990 --> 07:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
i have
 
07:54:27.990 --> 07:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
training and done research and water
 
07:54:29.830 --> 07:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
fluoridation as well as an infant
 
07:54:33.030 --> 07:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
formula content of fluorides i stand in
 
07:54:34.868 --> 07:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
07:54:36.548 --> 07:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
which you have heard from those who
 
07:54:38.708 --> 07:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
oppose water fluoridation
 
07:54:40.708 --> 07:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
every single point that you have heard
 
07:54:42.788 --> 07:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
has been scientifically shown to be
 
07:54:45.910 --> 07:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
inaccurate it is opinion of folks that
 
07:54:48.070 --> 07:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
believe this sometimes people believe it
 
07:54:50.230 --> 07:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
because they truly think that it's
 
07:54:53.030 --> 07:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
causing a health ill and i can be i can
 
07:54:54.708 --> 07:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
be compassionate with that and
 
07:54:57.110 --> 07:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
empathetic but science
 
07:54:58.948 --> 07:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
has to prove things based on the
 
07:55:01.350 --> 07:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
scientific method and if there is
 
07:55:04.468 --> 07:55:04.478 align:start position:0%
anything wrong with any part of what we
 
07:55:06.468 --> 07:55:06.478 align:start position:0%
do whether it's in medicine
 
07:55:08.548 --> 07:55:08.558 align:start position:0%
dentistry or any other healthcare
 
07:55:11.110 --> 07:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
profession we are the first ones to step
 
07:55:12.868 --> 07:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
out against it i just had a hip
 
07:55:14.468 --> 07:55:14.478 align:start position:0%
replacement two
 
07:55:17.110 --> 07:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago and god knows there's
 
07:55:19.270 --> 07:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
enough commercials on tv about did you
 
07:55:21.430 --> 07:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
get this commerci hip replacement well
 
07:55:23.430 --> 07:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
you could be suing you know what
 
07:55:25.270 --> 07:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
we want to know what's wrong so we look
 
07:55:27.030 --> 07:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
at the research the
 
07:55:30.070 --> 07:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
systematic research has been done
 
07:55:32.948 --> 07:55:32.958 align:start position:0%
look at when fluoride was discovered
 
07:55:34.708 --> 07:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
have the benefits to the cheek it was
 
07:55:34.718 --> 07:55:36.868 align:start position:0%
have the benefits to the cheek it was
1901

07:55:36.868 --> 07:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
1901
 
07:55:39.990 --> 07:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
we had fluoride discovered as a
 
07:55:42.388 --> 07:55:42.398 align:start position:0%
positive impact on the health of teeth
 
07:55:44.628 --> 07:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
it wasn't in 1945
 
07:55:49.030 --> 07:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
we had no idea what was causing cavity
 
07:55:51.670 --> 07:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
reductions in these areas where people
 
07:55:53.750 --> 07:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
had a little brown stain on their teeth
 
07:55:56.230 --> 07:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's called the virginal fluorescent
 
07:55:59.190 --> 07:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
then we had areas where people in the
 
07:55:59.200 --> 07:56:00.628 align:start position:0%
then we had areas where people in the
areas

07:56:00.628 --> 07:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
areas
 
07:56:02.468 --> 07:56:02.478 align:start position:0%
that had good looking teeth with little
 
07:56:04.548 --> 07:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
tiny white marks on their teeth well in
 
07:56:08.230 --> 07:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
1930 a fluoride probe was invented that
 
07:56:09.990 --> 07:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
we said let's go back and measure these
 
07:56:12.150 --> 07:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
areas well in areas like colorado
 
07:56:13.830 --> 07:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
springs where they had brown stains on
 
07:56:16.070 --> 07:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
the tee they had two to 12 parts per
 
07:56:18.468 --> 07:56:18.478 align:start position:0%
million of fluoride in the water health
 
07:56:21.190 --> 07:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
was great no health issues at all in
 
07:56:23.190 --> 07:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
areas where it was good
 
07:56:26.548 --> 07:56:26.558 align:start position:0%
looking teeth and almost no cavities was
 
07:56:28.948 --> 07:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
one part per million so that's where the
 
07:56:31.910 --> 07:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
one part per million became set that's
 
07:56:34.070 --> 07:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
where we added fluoride to the already
 
07:56:37.750 --> 07:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
existing florida and water in 1945 and a
 
07:56:41.190 --> 07:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
eight city study that was done and we
 
07:56:45.270 --> 07:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
found cavity rays to drop off 60 to 70
 
07:56:48.150 --> 07:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
percent we knew we were onto something
 
07:56:50.388 --> 07:56:50.398 align:start position:0%
so we replicated what mother nature
 
07:56:52.310 --> 07:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
showed us fluorides the 13th most
 
07:56:55.190 --> 07:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
abundant men are on the earth's surface
 
07:56:56.708 --> 07:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
moving beyond that
 
07:56:58.548 --> 07:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
all of the studies all the information
 
07:57:00.628 --> 07:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
you've heard today every bit of it i
 
07:57:02.388 --> 07:57:02.398 align:start position:0%
would be willing to go through with you
 
07:57:04.628 --> 07:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
with chapter and verse in scientific
 
07:57:07.350 --> 07:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
references not to some website not just
 
07:57:10.310 --> 07:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
something obscure but with every single
 
07:57:10.320 --> 07:57:11.270 align:start position:0%
something obscure but with every single
thing

07:57:11.270 --> 07:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
thing
 
07:57:13.750 --> 07:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
noted that you've asked for including
 
07:57:16.628 --> 07:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
where your additives come from and where
 
07:57:18.548 --> 07:57:18.558 align:start position:0%
do you purchase them from all of these
 
07:57:20.468 --> 07:57:20.478 align:start position:0%
things can be answered very simply using
 
07:57:23.110 --> 07:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
the cdc's website
 
07:57:26.388 --> 07:57:26.398 align:start position:0%
state information all of it can be
 
07:57:27.750 --> 07:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
the second thing i want to really
 
07:57:29.670 --> 07:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
mention to you is the change in the
 
07:57:33.270 --> 07:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
fluoride level from 0.7 to 1.2 parts per
 
07:57:33.280 --> 07:57:36.070 align:start position:0%
fluoride level from 0.7 to 1.2 parts per
million

07:57:36.070 --> 07:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:36.080 --> 07:57:36.868 align:start position:0%
 
well

07:57:36.868 --> 07:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
well
 
07:57:38.868 --> 07:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much there is
 
07:57:40.708 --> 07:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
no more
 
07:57:40.718 --> 07:57:41.910 align:start position:0%
no more
uh

07:57:41.910 --> 07:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:57:43.510 --> 07:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
no more hands up
 
07:57:43.520 --> 07:57:45.510 align:start position:0%
no more hands up
and

07:57:45.510 --> 07:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:57:49.350 --> 07:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
i've already called for that and
 
07:57:51.990 --> 07:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's i will declare is
 
07:57:53.670 --> 07:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
give me the list
 
07:57:55.910 --> 07:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah there are i can lead it off too
 
07:57:57.510 --> 07:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay we have
 
07:58:00.468 --> 07:58:00.478 align:start position:0%
40 on the list in support
 
07:58:02.548 --> 07:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
of hb611
 
07:58:05.030 --> 07:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
we have 21 opposed
 
07:58:07.190 --> 07:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
on the list okay so it's quite expensive
 
07:58:10.548 --> 07:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
i think all right so so 40 were
 
07:58:13.430 --> 07:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
so for how 40 were four support
 
07:58:13.440 --> 07:58:14.548 align:start position:0%
so for how 40 were four support
21

07:58:14.548 --> 07:58:14.558 align:start position:0%
21
 
07:58:16.388 --> 07:58:16.398 align:start position:0%
21 opposed
 
07:58:18.548 --> 07:58:18.558 align:start position:0%
even though there was a large larger
 
07:58:20.070 --> 07:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
number speaking
 
07:58:21.590 --> 07:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
in opposition
 
07:58:24.548 --> 07:58:24.558 align:start position:0%
but they signed in
 
07:58:26.868 --> 07:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
moore signed in opposed thank you very
 
07:58:26.878 --> 07:58:28.548 align:start position:0%
moore signed in opposed thank you very
much

07:58:28.548 --> 07:58:28.558 align:start position:0%

uh just
 
07:58:33.190 --> 07:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
going down the list
 
07:58:36.230 --> 07:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
i do see
 
07:58:38.230 --> 07:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
some i do see a number of uh
 
07:58:42.788 --> 07:58:42.798 align:start position:0%
