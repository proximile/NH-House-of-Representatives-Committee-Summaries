00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 align:start position:0%
it should be it should be on your desk
 
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh I know I want I give it to everybody
 
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:24.729 align:start position:0%
 
because

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
all right there we go
 
00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 align:start position:0%
all right again to everybody but myself
 
00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.150 align:start position:0%
all right again to everybody but myself
um

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
so um listening to the committee's
 
00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.430 align:start position:0%
so um listening to the committee's
discussion

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 align:start position:0%
um or rather hearings from SB 170 I
 
00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 align:start position:0%
reinstated the
 
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
um crossed outlines and added a
 
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
provision afterwards that says provided
 
00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 align:start position:0%
that after the after school and Hall
 
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 align:start position:0%
provided that the after school and
 
00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
holiday increase in capacity is
 
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
permitted by the state fire code and in
 
00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 align:start position:0%
compliance with any local ordinances so
 
00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that my goal there and we'll
 
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
discuss it when we
 
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.910 align:start position:0%
discuss it when we
um

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
we will discuss that when we actually
 
00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 align:start position:0%
take up the amendment but my goal there
 
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
is that will satisfy all parties
 
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
involved leave the
 
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
um after school increase in place for
 
00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 align:start position:0%
where it currently exists or is
 
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
allowable but also recognizes that State
 
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
Fire code and stuff like that you have
 
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
to follow that so that's my goal there
 
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.210 align:start position:0%
to follow that so that's my goal there
um

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
McWilliams came in but I didn't see her
 
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
I believe she had an amendment or she
 
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 align:start position:0%
will gather her when he comes back
 
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
um on SB 221 obviously when we get to
 
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
Executive we'll actually vote on that my
 
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
hope is that a member will make a motion
 
00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
to retain that bill
 
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe we are going to do
 
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
anything with it today but I think it
 
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
would be wise to hold on to it in case
 
00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
we find something later in the year that
 
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
we want to grab we do have a vehicle not
 
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
that we're allowed to have placeholder
 
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
legislation wink wink nudge nudge but we
 
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
can have placeholder legislation if you
 
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
actually read our rules so
 
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
are you you're Distributing your
 
00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
and ribs and McWilliams can you give one
 
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 align:start position:0%
um so we have these distributed
 
00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
amendments we have my stated purpose on
 
00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.650 align:start position:0%
amendments we have my stated purpose on
sv221

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
sv221
 
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
um does any other member have anything
 
00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
they'd like to say while we're in a work
 
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
session before we begin executive
 
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
sessions at 10 15.
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
does any member of the public we are in
 
00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
a work session we're allowed to hear
 
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
from the public as a member of the
 
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
public wish to look at the relative
 
00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 align:start position:0%
amendments that have been distributed in
 
00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.490 align:start position:0%

um in case we want to continue our work
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
session for whatever reason but I'll see
 
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:48.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:51.060 align:start position:0%

00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
um we are now in discussion on the
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
amendment is there a discussion on the
 
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
amendment Presby Williams like to speak
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
to your motion I would please and thank
 
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
you chair
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
um so during uh the hearing on SB 94 we
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
had a bit of a discussion about what may
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
happen if uh the age of a child with
 
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
special education or disabilities is
 
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.839 align:start position:0%
changed in the future and the fact that
 
00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
restricting to a certain age might
 
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
actually lock us into needing to do an
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
amendment as a committee or even as the
 
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
entire House and Senate so rather than
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
locking it in the intention of this
 
00:17:21.049 --> 00:17:21.059 align:start position:0%
amendment is to Simply refer to the
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
definitions under RSA 186 C2 regarding
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
receiving special education and related
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
Services by the child's School District
 
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
so we're putting this over to education
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
and if they decide to raise the age of
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
services in the future this will move in
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
lockstep with it so that's the end
 
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
attention of this amendment is just to
 
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
not lock children who fall under that
 
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
bucket into a certain age restriction
 
00:17:48.049 --> 00:17:48.059 align:start position:0%
excellent Is there further discussion on
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
um does anyone have any objection to
 
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
from DHHS commenting on the amendment we
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
are an executive session so it would be
 
00:17:58.970 --> 00:17:58.980 align:start position:0%
without objection without objection it's
 
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:07.370 align:start position:0%
without objection without objection it's
fine

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and representative of
 
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Melissa Clement um
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
Chief the child care licensing unit and
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
I am definitely in favor of the
 
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
amendment but I just realized one thing
 
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
in reading it if we limit it to
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
um to a child with a disability as
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
defined under RSA 186 C2 that is a New
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Amendment and it may cause
 
00:18:30.049 --> 00:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
issues for our out-of-state students who
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
are wouldn't fall under that definition
 
00:18:33.169 --> 00:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
because they're coming from another
 
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
state so they're not
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
under that definition because then it's
 
00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:39.299 align:start position:0%
not just New Hampshire students that
 
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
would be in these residential programs
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
we also have students from Massachusetts
 
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
from other states who are coming into
 
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
our residential programs they're being
 
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
placed there by an educational placement
 
00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:51.539 align:start position:0%
but it's not under that statute it would
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
be under the statutes in their states so
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
I I like the idea behind this and not
 
00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:57.299 align:start position:0%
trying to limit it to an age but I'm
 
00:18:59.330 --> 00:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
also worried about how we might be able
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
to address the needs of those that are
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
coming from other states and making sure
 
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:06.059 align:start position:0%
we're allowing them to have that
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
Residential Care as well and remain in
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
care and I'm sorry this as I was reading
 
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
it that just came to me it wasn't we
 
00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:15.419 align:start position:0%
have options
 
00:19:15.419 --> 00:19:17.390 align:start position:0%
have options
um

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
this is a general concern for the
 
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:20.220 align:start position:0%
committee do we want to proceed Fourth
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment do we want to
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
um recess the bill what do you what's
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
kind of the general disposition of the
 
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
the schools from out of state all the
 
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.610 align:start position:0%
the schools from out of state all the
time

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
um and I would defer to however the
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
schools are treating those children who
 
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
are coming in from out of state even if
 
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
they're out of state children
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
um and so I do think that this
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
definition encompasses that I'm just
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
pulling it up to to read you know
 
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
exactly how it works here
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
um it does include every person under
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
the age 21 so you do have a very nice
 
00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:05.750 align:start position:0%
the age 21 so you do have a very nice
coverall

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
coverall
 
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
to begin with
 
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
so I'm
 
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:12.140 align:start position:0%
I know this is you know
 
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
legislating in the middle of an exact
 
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
session it's hard because we just want
 
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
to vote yes or no on it
 
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.490 align:start position:0%
to vote yes or no on it
um

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm just pulling up the definitions
 
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
and it looks like it's pretty
 
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
encompassing here
 
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.510 align:start position:0%
encompassing here
um

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
child with a disability shall include a
 
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
child ages 18 to 21 who was identified
 
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
as a child with a disability and
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
received services in accordance with an
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
individual education program but who
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
left school prior to his or her
 
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
incarceration whoa okay or was
 
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
identified as a child with a disability
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
but did not have an IEP in his or her
 
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
last educational institution so
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
that could mean out of state I'm just
 
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
so I I think we probably would want to
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
hear from someone on the school side how
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
they handle this for people who come
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
from out of state because it seems like
 
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
this doesn't necessarily say you have to
 
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
have received services in New Hampshire
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
in order to qualify for the definition
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
of 1862 but we may not have that person
 
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
in this room
 
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
representative page just looking looking
 
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
at the definition
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
it does say evaluated by a school
 
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
district according to rules adopted by
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education which I
 
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
assume would be
 
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire so I and I and I want
 
00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
to thank Ms Clement for bringing this up
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
representing a district where we have a
 
00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
very large number of students remain in
 
00:21:42.409 --> 00:21:42.419 align:start position:0%
our centers
 
00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
um this is that is definitely a
 
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
consideration I'm glad you graced it had
 
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
okay so we can um we have options here
 
00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.059 align:start position:0%
I'll go back to my original question
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
which is how does the committee feel we
 
00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:57.059 align:start position:0%
should handle this move forward we want
 
00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
to recess the discussion of the
 
00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:00.299 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
um to an executive session which I would
 
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
have to notice for next week most likely
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
to make our deadlines which is fine
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
sorry representative page it's only it's
 
00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:15.059 align:start position:0%
only a 18 minute drive for me it's only
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
an age
 
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
yes representative ball
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
I just had a question I'm sorry just for
 
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
a clarification
 
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
um it does say or special
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
identified by the child school district
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't specify if it's in-state
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
or out of state so doesn't that cover
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
all school districts and we do have this
 
00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
vehicle called legislative intent which
 
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
is if it is put in our Clerk's note that
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
include out of state um
 
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
uh with first they'd have to find
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
somebody to sue then they'd have to find
 
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
somebody to go through the notes
 
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
um so we we do have this lovely vehicle
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
called legislative intent and if that is
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
our intent is to include students from
 
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
um and that is how this committee is
 
00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
reading it and that is how it is
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
reflected in the official record taken
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
by our wonderful clerk
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
um then that um does actually become law
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
um it just makes somebody having to put
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
it together in the future have a little
 
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
bit of a headache but we can always
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
so is that the is that the disposition
 
00:23:18.169 --> 00:23:18.179 align:start position:0%
of this committee is that we believe
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
this encompasses out of state yes
 
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
School District
 
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
would that make a difference in
 
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
understanding that it's both in and out
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
of state if we say the child's home
 
00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
that may not be relevant
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
my I guess my uh my response to that was
 
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
we if we amend the amendment um we can
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
then just do it we don't have to like
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
bend it at that point we can actually
 
00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:48.649 align:start position:0%
bend it at that point we can actually
just

00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
explicitly say what we want we don't
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
have to be clever if we've amended the
 
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
amendment yes representative Neil
 
00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
um the RSA wrong or incorrectly but when
 
00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
I'm reading you know the rules I was
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
adopted by the State Board of Education
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
it's State Board of Education not
 
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
capitalized so it
 
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
is okay so we can't use that to just say
 
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
that that would encompass
 
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts New Hampshire Maine
 
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean they would have to the
 
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
person the people interpreting the
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
legislation that we pass would have to
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
first they're going to the first thing
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to do is they're going to
 
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
read it literally right so if the
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
literal reading of it means only New
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students then we have a
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
problem if it's Up For Debate
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
then they will go to legislative intent
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
which we get to dictate via the record
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative this may be the
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
lawyer in me but you know playing with
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
the words here I mean so we're saying as
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment's written up to the age of
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
a child with a disability is defined in
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
RSA 186 C2 and their receiving special
 
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
education from their school district but
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
whether whether this definition we have
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
here under RSA 186 C2 is exactly the
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
same as what's in Massachusetts Maine
 
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
Vermont or any of these other states to
 
00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:06.539 align:start position:0%
me may not be relevant as long as the
 
00:25:09.409 --> 00:25:09.419 align:start position:0%
child is meeting this definition
 
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't it still apply and cover
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
that child it seems like it certainly
 
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh if you catch my drift it seems like
 
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
maybe when we meet next year we'll fix
 
00:25:27.179 --> 00:25:28.010 align:start position:0%
maybe when we meet next year we'll fix
that

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
so so they really know what we mean is
 
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
everybody on board with that
 
00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
all right is there any further
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment thank you
 
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.140 align:start position:0%

irregardless our legislative attendance
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
um and I would love it if somebody would
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
second me second thank you

representative for the the second we are
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
now on discussion on the amendment uh I
 
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
will again recognize myself to speak to
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
my own Amendment
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
Gotta Love parliamentary procedure
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
um so after listening to the
 
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.149 align:start position:0%
um so after listening to the
um

00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
the concerns about the issues
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
surrounding the fire code and the
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
confusion I reintroduced the I unstruck
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
the lines
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
um that reduced the before and after
 
00:29:21.529 --> 00:29:21.539 align:start position:0%
school chair care and holiday care but I
 
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
included in the RSA what I would call
 
00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
clarifying language so that if there to
 
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
reduce the confusion
 
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
um so the language is very simple it
 
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
unstrikes the lines and incurts the
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
Clause afterwards provided that after
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
school and holiday provided that the
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
after school and holiday increase in
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
capacity is permitted by the state fire
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
code and in compliance with any local
 
00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:45.230 align:start position:0%
code and in compliance with any local
ordinances

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
um so I did that to relieve the
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
confusion I was going I want to pass the
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill I'm not discussing the
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
online bill right now but my I was going
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
to have issues voting for it if it could
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
be in any which way interpreted as
 
00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
potentially constraining new supply of
 
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
child care in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
so um I tried to strike that middle
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
ground of keep the Bill if it actually
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
changes nothing in terms of
 
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
functionality that is my goal
 
00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:16.740 align:start position:0%
um but it I I think it would my hope is
 
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
that it assuages the concerns from the
 
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
public about confusion for new centers
 
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
um but also what I believe are my
 
00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
concerns which are about limiting
 
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:27.419 align:start position:0%
potential increasing capacity which is
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
what I view as the current crisis of
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
health of child care in the state of New
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that's my opening solve on
 
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
the amendment I'm sure others would like
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
or maybe they wouldn't okay
 
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.190 align:start position:0%
or maybe they wouldn't okay
um

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
well I would like to hear from the um
 
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
licensing and from the fire code
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
people about how this amendment they're
 
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
I would like to hear how I know you like
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment I like I guess I'd like
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear how in everyday life
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
how does this affect what um what
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
providers are going to be able to how
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
many children writers can care for okay
 
00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
without objection because once again we
 
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
are an executive so without exactly
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I'm so if I'm
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
understanding your question correctly
 
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
you want to know how this is going to
 
00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:27.299 align:start position:0%
impact day-to-day Life by able to
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
specifying clearly in the statute which
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
we can also communicate to Providers
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
we're able to show that we this is what
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
the statute will require but you also
 
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
have to be in compliance with whatever
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
your local ordinances require and also
 
00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
whatever the State Fire Marshal requires

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:55.740 align:start position:0%
saying that you could have nine children
 
00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
as a family child care or you could have
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
17 children with because because of the
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
additional school age they think that
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
they're able to do that and then they're
 
00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
finding along the way that their local
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
codes won't require it or the State Fire
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
Marshal codes won't require it and it
 
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
just creates a lot of angst for them
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
because they were under the impression I
 
00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
can have 17 children and thinking that
 
00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
they could apply for that but then
 
00:32:18.649 --> 00:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
finding out there are other restrictions
 
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
along the way that's preventing them
 
00:32:21.769 --> 00:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
from doing doing so so it'll help and
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
it'll also help with the local
 
00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:27.059 align:start position:0%
um both like planning boards and Zoning
 
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
committees because they tend to adopt
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
our definitions they will see that
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
clearly stated there so they will have
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
to look at them what their local
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
ordinances are to see if they have any
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
impediments or what restrictions they
 
00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.549 align:start position:0%
impediments or what restrictions they
have

00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
um so uh you wrote to us that there were
 
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
probably around 40 providers right now
 
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
who have the license that allows them to
 
00:32:57.169 --> 00:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
go up to 17 I guess how will that affect
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
how will this affect that those 40. it
 
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
actually shouldn't affect them at all
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
now because it'll they'll they will
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
remain they will remain they won't need
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
the grandfather clause no yeah we won't
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
have to we won't have to change any of
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
the license types everything will remain
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
as is and this will clarify the
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
confusion moving forward okay and new
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
providers that came in who meet
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:24.299 align:start position:0%
codes are going to be able to go up to
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
17. if their local ordinances allow for
 
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
that and if their state fire code allows
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
for if they've been approved for that
 
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
number through this local
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
um fire inspection yes okay let's have
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
one more question of course so one of
 
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.029 align:start position:0%
one more question of course so one of
the

00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:38.039 --> 00:33:39.590 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
Solutions you put forward originally
 
00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:45.059 align:start position:0%
when we saw this bill was that people
 
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
who had licenses for up to six family
 
00:33:50.169 --> 00:33:50.179 align:start position:0%
child care providers would now be called
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
group family child care
 
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do that now we won't
 
00:33:59.570 --> 00:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative Simone
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to move the question
 
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.789 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to move the question
if

00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:06.470 align:start position:0%
if
committees

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.270 align:start position:0%
committees
amenable

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
amenable
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
um we we can do that our rules are are
 
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
we operate our Masons and moving to
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
questions kind of a weird one in our
 
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
roles um so we'll we'll finish um we'll
 
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
let all the members who want to speak
 
00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:18.710 align:start position:0%
let all the members who want to speak
speak

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
um but then yes because it's uh I don't
 
00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:22.379 align:start position:0%
want to get by if this was Robert's
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
Rules of Order you could absolutely move
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
to previous question and we would do
 
00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
full list of residential zoning
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
ordinances for family child care and a
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
lot of them have it seems much uh
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
stricter restrictions on the number of
 
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
children that can be cared for
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
um does adding in
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
mean that
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
or make any change to how they have to
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
do that does it restrict the number of
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
children it's certainly not because they
 
00:34:59.570 --> 00:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
should be already in compliance with
 
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
local ordinances
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
um so it's clarifying language right so
 
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:05.099 align:start position:0%
it's it's clarifying So in theory they
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
if they already have the ability to do
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
this which they clearly do from our
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
excellent document from our community
 
00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.089 align:start position:0%
excellent document from our community
researcher

00:35:11.089 --> 00:35:11.099 align:start position:0%
researcher
 
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
um they already have to abide by
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
themselves it doesn't that that part of
 
00:35:16.609 --> 00:35:16.619 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change anything
 
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
I would never bring forward something
 
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
that would restrict
 
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
child care I would hope you I would hope
 
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
you I hope you hope you know me better
 
00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:25.619 align:start position:0%
than that
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
um further discussion on the amendment
 
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
