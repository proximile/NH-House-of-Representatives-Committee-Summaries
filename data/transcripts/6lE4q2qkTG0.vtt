to welcome all our guests to the uh
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
higher education study committee here in
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
in the house in the Senate and we do
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
have a agenda it's uh a short agenda but
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
it has three healthy topics on it and
 
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to start out by just
 
00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:32.459 align:start position:0%
welcoming everybody and to go around and
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%

Roblox

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
Roblox
 
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.230 align:start position:0%
Roblox
okay

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:32.569 --> 00:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
so we're just starting out here
 
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
and we have an agenda I'd like to ask
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
first is there any other item that folks
 
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
on the study committee would like to
 
00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:44.339 align:start position:0%
discuss underneath other uh if so let's
 
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
just amend it right now or accept the
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
agenda as printed
 
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
so we will do that we'll just accept the
 
00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:55.139 align:start position:0%
agenda as printed and we're going to
 
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
jump right into the uh first item
 
00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
underneath uh our newer business here
 
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
today and I'd like to welcome Nate uh
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
potich to our committee he's Provost at
 
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State University and I had the
 
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
pleasure as a trustee with the
 
00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:14.339 align:start position:0%
university system to listen to a
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
presentation conducted by Nate
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
several months ago now and really
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
interesting and I think it's important
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
that we understand what their what we're
 
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
doing in terms of academics out in the
 
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
schools Plymouth State and Keene State
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
College King and and UNH as well and so
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
Nate's been invited here today to take
 
00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:39.139 align:start position:0%
us through what is transpiring here at
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
Plymouth state in terms of high impact
 
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
practices so welcome Nate
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so my hope today is
 
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
to sort of simplify things while uh
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
giving you some insight into what we're
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
doing so there's a bit of jargon but I
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
will do my best to minimize so I'm going
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
to talk about high impact educational
 
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
practices which have become known as
 
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
hips the acronym a bit tedious but
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
um and a little bit of history in a
 
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
background and I'll explain why I think
 
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
they matter and then I'll talk a bit
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
about some of the ways that we in the
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
usnh system engage in these high impact
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
educational practices So This Acronym
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
hip came into regular use about 15 20
 
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
years ago in 2008 a guy named George
 
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
 published this book called high
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
impact educational practices and who has
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
access to them and why they matter and
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
it was the first sort of sustained look
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
at you know different kinds of teaching
 
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
methodologies focusing specifically on
 
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
this set of practices which I'll talk
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
about and I think it really was it was
 
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
an effort to say okay we know the
 
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
lecture model where the professor stands
 
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
in front of the classroom and he or she
 
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
shares their wisdom and everyone takes
 
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
notes and then hopefully on the day of
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
the exam they spit it out right and get
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
an A that worked well for all of us I
 
00:17:59.450 --> 00:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
think um but I do think we recognize and
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
research has shown that there are other
 
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
ways of learning that can be really
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
valuable and I think high impact
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
practice has fallen to that that
 
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
category so
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
um the there were sort of 10 high impact
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
practices that he identified arbitrarily
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
and the lists have been modified I'm
 
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
going to talk today about six of them
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
because those six are tied to a survey
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
called the national survey of student
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
engagement which over the years millions
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
of students have engaged in at thousands
 
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
of universities and it really is a
 
00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
survey about this kind of learning high
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
impact practice learning so the
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
categories that I'm going to sort of
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
refer to the examples of I impact
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
practice are things like Service
 
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
Learning so they ask students about how
 
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:48.140 align:start position:0%
many of your courses have included
 
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
community-based project or service
 
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
learning where you're getting out there
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
and providing service to a community or
 
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
a group so that's one high impact
 
00:18:59.330 --> 00:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
practice learning communities now I
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if how familiar you are but
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
it's become more and more common to put
 
00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
groups of students together both inside
 
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
and outside the classroom
 
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
because we all know that a lot of
 
00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
learning happens outside of the
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
classroom so for example our nursing
 
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.830 align:start position:0%
classroom so for example our nursing
students

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
if they elect to they can live on a
 
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
floor of one of our dorms where all the
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
nursing students share you know live
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
together and we know from research that
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
though that learning happens in that
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
context as well as in the classroom
 
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
another high impact practice which
 
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with research with
 
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.169 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with research with
faculty

00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
faculty
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
this is one of those things where
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
one-on-one time or small group time with
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
the faculty member focusing on serious
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
research the lasting impact of that is
 
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.710 align:start position:0%
research the lasting impact of that is
tremendous

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
tremendous
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
internships and field experience getting
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
out of the campus getting off campus
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
getting into communities and working you
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
know that's something our students need
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
to do and we know that Hands-On applied
 
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
work is a powerful educator great way to
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
learn another high impact practice study
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
abroad getting out of your comfort zone
 
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
and getting out of your country and
 
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
seeing how the rest of the world works
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
for better and For Worse
 
00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:18.059 align:start position:0%
and uh at uh the presentation in April
 
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
the Board of Trustees uh Provost Jones
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
talked about study abroad they have an
 
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
extensive and diverse really powerful
 
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
study abroad programs at UNH which they
 
00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
are generous enough to share with
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State University students so
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's been a partnership that's been good
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
for us and finally a big practices that
 
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
I'll talk about is a culminating senior
 
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
experience and what they mean by this is
 
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
does the seniors at your University at
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
the end of their experience think about
 
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
how their four years come together can
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
they walk out of the University with a
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
clear set of skills a vision you know
 
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
can they synthesize what they've learned
 
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
in a way that makes their college
 
00:20:59.810 --> 00:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
experience meaningful
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
so those are examples of these high
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
impact practices
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
now why do they matter
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
um it's been like I said about 15 almost
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
20 years since this book was published
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
and there's three significant takeaways
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
that research has shown and again
 
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
there's tons of data on this
 
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
three things arise from engaging in
 
00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
these high impact practices first of all
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
high impact practices improve retention
 
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
and graduation rates
 
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
students research has shown again that
 
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
students who participate in hips are
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
more likely to persist have higher gpas
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
than their peers and graduate on time
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
more likely to graduate within six years
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
than those students who don't who just
 
00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
engage in traditional classroom learning
 
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
so that's one big Advantage retention
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
and graduation
 
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
the second thing and it shouldn't come
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
as a surprise students who engage in
 
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
high impact practices have clear career
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
advantages as they leave College
 
00:21:59.570 --> 00:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
if you participate in these practices
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
it's a statistically significant
 
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
predictor of future career and early job
 
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
attainment so you know this is a
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
transferable set of skills you're
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
learning how to work while you're in
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
college so you leave and you're ready
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
you don't need to you know make mistakes
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
at three jobs before you figure out what
 
00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
it means to be an adult and make a
 
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:19.789 align:start position:0%
it means to be an adult and make a
living

00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
living
 
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
um and I think the third significant
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
benefit that's been documented by
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
research and this one is is especially
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
important for me at Plymouth State and I
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
think Mark's team
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
the preparation gaps that students come
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
to college with you know we know that
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
students don't all come equally prepared
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
you know they don't all have the same
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
academic background same family
 
00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:45.299 align:start position:0%
structure you know who if that's going
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
to be very diverse preparation coming
 
00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
into the college Environ it makes I know
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
as a professor myself you have to teach
 
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
to all the students in the room that can
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
be immensely challenging high impact
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
practices close those preparation gaps
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
because they don't rely on academic
 
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
education alone high impact practice is
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
really leverage skills that students
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
often already have right do you know how
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
to work do you know how to work in teams
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
do you know how to synthesize do you
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
know how to figure things out with your
 
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
hands maybe instead of a book
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
so it's I think it's really interesting
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
this idea that these kinds of courses
 
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
these kinds of practices that we build
 
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
into our teaching actually serve
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
students that come to our colleges our
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
campuses less prepared
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
um you know these have become recognized
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
drivers of success and so in the usnh
 
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
system and all of our campuses we've had
 
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
to really ensure that our students won
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
they have these experiences and we've
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
been all very deliberate about that and
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
I'll talk about some ways that we've
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
been delivered about that and the second
 
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
thing isn't always the case we have to
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
gather data and make sure that what
 
00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
we're doing is effective and how can we
 
00:23:59.690 --> 00:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
improve it that's a constant for us
 
00:24:02.529 --> 00:24:02.539 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the second page here
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
and one of the interesting and important
 
00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
things it's nice to highlight I don't
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
always get to highlight successes in my
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
job but in this case I do
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
um it this this survey again the
 
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
national survey of student engagement
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
um 469 colleges participated last year
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh 1700 have since 2000 uh last year
 
00:24:27.409 --> 00:24:27.419 align:start position:0%
over a quarter of a million students
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
responded to the survey over six and a
 
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
half million have over the years and if
 
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
you look at the message it's clear Kane
 
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:36.539 align:start position:0%
state Plymouth State and UNH Excel when
 
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
it comes to this kind of teaching
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
methodology these high impact practices
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
we're ahead of our peer institutions New
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
England public colleges and universities
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
and Carnegie class comparators
 
00:24:51.049 --> 00:24:51.059 align:start position:0%
so I this is a real success and I think
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
it's important to note
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
we're three very different institutions
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
in the usnh system
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
who we serve what our mission is how we
 
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
articulate how we play to our strengths
 
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
those are very different universities
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
and what I find interesting is as
 
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
different as we are we are all strong in
 
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
this really important area in our own
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
different ways please
 
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
just adding one thing for contacts uh
 
00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
those numbers if you compare ours to our
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
peer groups put us put you and H number
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
22 in the country of all research
 
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
universities in the country and put
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
Keane and Plymouth both in the top
 
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
quartile for their respective peer
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
groups so this is really a top
 
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
performing area for all of our campuses
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
it's applicable more broadly than that
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
the the way the survey is run not every
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
institution does it every year but every
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
institution will do it over a period of
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
three years uh and so that integrates
 
00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:54.419 align:start position:0%
over the three years for the numbers I
 
00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:55.190 align:start position:0%
over the three years for the numbers I
gave

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
gave
 
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.450 align:start position:0%
gave
yeah

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:25:59.330 --> 00:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
so it it's interesting and I what I
 
00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
really and then what we talked about at
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
the board meeting I wanted to put some
 
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
some meat on this to give some examples
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
so it's not all theoretical so
 
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
um and Wayne talked about study abroad
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
and he had a presentation on it
 
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
um and James Bibi at Keane did a
 
00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
presentation on student research and he
 
00:26:21.169 --> 00:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
because we were a team during the
 
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
meeting three students came up and
 
00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
talked about their work uh and how
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
they've worked with faculty members and
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
external entities an architect that was
 
00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:30.740 align:start position:0%
an amazing presentation
 
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
to really change that have the intense
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
meaningful and after graduation powerful
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
educational experience and what I talked
 
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
about and what I will talk about today
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
is how we do it at Plymouth state
 
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
um our cluster model our cluster
 
00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
learning model which you probably may
 
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
have heard about from president Burks is
 
00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
really all about high impact practices
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
when Don came to Plymouth State eight
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
years ago now he looked at what we were
 
00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
doing and said okay what do our students
 
00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
need what are the students in North
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
Country and New Hampshire need and he
 
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
said we want them to graduate equipped
 
00:27:06.649 --> 00:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
to get out there solve problems and make
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
a difference and what do we need to do
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
that well he'd been thinking about this
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
as a scientist researcher and academic
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
but also someone who's worked in
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
Industry he knows how to get things done
 
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
and he knows the tools that students
 
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
need so we put together this cluster
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
model that focuses on an applied
 
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary project-based
 
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
education and that's really what Don's
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
vision is about and that's one of the
 
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
reasons I came to Plymouth state is very
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
powerful working you know students
 
00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
working in teams to solve real world
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
problems and doing that in an
 
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
environment first in the classroom but
 
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
then outside the classroom in the Kim
 
00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
Community making an impact in New
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so our whole curriculum from
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
the day that a student walks onto campus
 
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to take a course that fits
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
into this high impact model so all of
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
our freshmen take a course called
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
tackling a wicked problem
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
and literally the professor and the
 
00:28:03.049 --> 00:28:03.059 align:start position:0%
students when the class starts don't
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
know what the problem will be
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
life doesn't you don't get to pick the
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
problems you have to solve in life so
 
00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges in this course is
 
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
to figure out okay what problem are we
 
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
going to work on and the second thing is
 
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
it has to be a wicked problem not an
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
easy problem all the important
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
challenges that confront us are wicked
 
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
complicated complex not black or white
 
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
and so we want to have our students
 
00:28:27.529 --> 00:28:27.539 align:start position:0%
thinking that way as early as possible
 
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
so tackling a wicked problem is
 
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
precisely that okay what are we going to
 
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
work on okay homelessness in North
 
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
Country that's a wicked problem there's
 
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
not an easy solution to it so the
 
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
faculty and the students will come up
 
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
with a project to see how they can begin
 
00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
addressing they're not going to solve
 
00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:45.059 align:start position:0%
the problem but start tackling it
 
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
working on it this kind of learning
 
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
happens in all majors all programs this
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
high impact engaged learning getting out
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
of the classroom Community Learning
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
um as a senior again one of those six
 
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
high impact practices is a Capstone a
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
senior experience that integrates all of
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
our seniors take what we call an in-cap
 
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
surprise surprise integrated Capstone to
 
00:29:12.649 --> 00:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
make sure that they have a sense of the
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
breadth and the connections in their
 
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
education through their four years
 
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.710 align:start position:0%
education through their four years
so

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.810 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.389 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
other way that we do was we we do these
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
cluster projects they're called and it's
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
one of the most powerful examples and I
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
think this is maybe why uh
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd found this in
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
compelling story uh back in Durham and
 
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
when was it when I did the presentation
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
on the Gorham project or my students did
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
I didn't was that the fall October
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
October so we had a bunch of students
 
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
working with one of our business
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
professors Chantal forged and she knew
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
that she heard of this the Gorham paper
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
mill up outside of Berlin had been
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
purchased by a wealthy Mass a New Yorker
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
who Manhattan Knight who was trying to
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
figure out what to do with it uh
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
producing a little bit of paper but
 
00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
basically this huge plot of land not
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
really put to good use didn't know what
 
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
to do with it our students went up there
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
as a group as a Consulting team and
 
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
worked with Town Citizens Business
 
00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:16.740 align:start position:0%
people surveyed the community worked
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
with this owner from New York to come up
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
with four different business models of
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
how you could leverage that space that
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
land so you know having to do with a
 
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
farm to table possibility or an outdoor
 
00:30:33.769 --> 00:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
adventure space or some I think the farm
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
to table had a b feature so Bunches of a
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
manufacturing plan which I think is
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately what the owner went with
 
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
working with the Canadian company so
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
this is a prime example of our students
 
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
being sent out into the real world to
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
solve a problem that does not have a
 
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
predetermined answer
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
what I've put in front of you this is a
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
another version instead of the Gorham
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
paper mill project which I'm I'm happy
 
00:30:59.090 --> 00:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
to share you their 100 and something
 
00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:00.779 align:start position:0%
page Consulting report if you're
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
interested that they provided the owner
 
00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
but what I have today is pardon me if
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
you go to
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
the Plymouth creative pfu PSU
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
student-run marketing design agency this
 
00:31:15.769 --> 00:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
is another again this is a course
 
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
students get credit for this and it's a
 
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
course run by two business professors
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
and an Arts Professor who specializes in
 
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
graphic design and essentially what the
 
00:31:27.049 --> 00:31:27.059 align:start position:0%
course is
 
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
is a marketing and advertising and
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
design agency called Plymouth creative
 
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
and this has been going now for a couple
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
of years
 
00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
um and it's had a tremendous impact uh
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
these professors they get out there in
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
the community they do various kinds of
 
00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:45.539 align:start position:0%
work it's completely experiential it's
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
engaged with the community so if you go
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
to the next page you see about 15 to 20
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
students 25 students a semester and if
 
00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
you scroll through to this funny looking
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
page to the services offered
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
you can see what they offer to local
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
business people as their services so you
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
want to do graphic design work or social
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
media work we have a one of the partners
 
00:32:15.889 --> 00:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
in town uh peppercorn Market which I'm a
 
00:32:18.649 --> 00:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
big fan of on Main Street there they
 
00:32:21.649 --> 00:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
were inept at social media so they
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
really needed our students to do among
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
other things a social media campaign for
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
them which is now excellent web
 
00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
development market research so again for
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
the Gorham paper mill project the
 
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
students surveyed the community and
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
figured out what do people want how can
 
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
we use this piece of land
 
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
uh event planning and branding and
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
campaign development so
 
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
they've worked now with um there's a
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
full list of Partners here but it's very
 
00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.029 align:start position:0%
full list of Partners here but it's very
impressive

00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
impressive
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
um Gunstock ski resort Owl's Nest
 
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
Waterville Valley we have a car
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
um for the new New Hampshire Electric
 
00:32:59.810 --> 00:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
Co-op that drives around campus a
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
plug-in car that's wrapped in a design
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
done by these students local charity
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
Franconia Inn and then again my favorite
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
this peppercorn Market which they've
 
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
done tremendous work with they
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
completely closed this Market down
 
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
rebuilt it rebranded it found extra
 
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
funding in fact which surprised me I
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
didn't know they'd been involved in that
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
and they reopened about a month ago they
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
had a grand reopening and they've been
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
knocking it out of the park with the
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
help of our students they've done a
 
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
great job
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the testimonials you
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
know we have a full list of Partners
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
here this is an amazing thing this is a
 
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
free service that we provide to people
 
00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
who might not have the resources like
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
peppercorn Market they don't have the
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
money to go hire a Tony firm to help
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
them with their marketing campaign our
 
00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
students have done tremendous work for
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
them and they've seen real value and
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
return on this and of course if you go
 
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
to the next page of testimonials it's
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
our students
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
they're working they're out there in the
 
00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
world making a difference figuring out
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
how to how to leverage their education
 
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
and then the last two pages there's a
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
full list of Our Community Partners
 
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
which will continue to grow
 
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
um and it's just been it's really
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
rewarding uh watching these students do
 
00:34:14.089 --> 00:34:14.099 align:start position:0%
this and the impact on our local
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
businesses they're working with Tenney
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
Mountain uh it was an ambitious
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
expansion efforts with a mass investor
 
00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
so there's tons of opportunity and I
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
just really admire and then I had to my
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
faculty colleagues uh Pam Anderson
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
Denise Hutchins and George botanico I
 
00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
wanted to celebrate their creativity and
 
00:34:33.649 --> 00:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
Entrepreneurship so this is just a quick
 
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
snapshot of what you're doing
 
00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
these high impact practices are not new
 
00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:40.619 align:start position:0%
to any of us at any of our institutions
 
00:34:42.589 --> 00:34:42.599 align:start position:0%
we've served our communities the North
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
Country New Hampshire at PSU we've been
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
doing this for 150 years UT prosum that
 
00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
I may serve that's our motto and that's
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
one of the cores of this sort of
 
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
educational philosophy and the cluster
 
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
learning model and these high impact
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
practices are way of moving that Vision
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
forward so I've overstayed my welcome
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
talk too much I will be quiet now and
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important that you see
 
00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:08.099 align:start position:0%
how we're thinking how we're
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
collaborating working to serve our
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
students and what they need and
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately our communities in the state
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so thank you
 
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Nate that's a
 
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
wonderful overview of the program and I
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
just recall when the trustees were
 
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
provided this information we talked
 
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
about how a logo can really impact
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
um the university system and I'm sure
 
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
Wayne that UNH went through a lot of
 
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
this When developing the new logo you
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
have here now or I hope they did so what
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do is I'd like to open this
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
up to questions from the committee at
 
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
this time if folks have questions to ask
 
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.450 align:start position:0%
this time if folks have questions to ask
of

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.710 align:start position:0%
of
Nate

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
Nate
 
00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
represent uh Senator oh thank you my son
 
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
is a graduate of Plymouth State Plymouth
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
State University it I think
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
he gave it the basic five
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
because his parents were paid the bills
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
but he stood very well I I like I like a
 
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
couple of things that that you're doing
 
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
I did meet with the president on a
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
couple of occasions actually I saw him
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
down here
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh it clicked a couple of weeks ago that
 
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
I enjoy his uh
 
00:36:26.089 --> 00:36:26.099 align:start position:0%
his vision
 
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
I think he is a Visionary uh it
 
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
certainly uh out of the ordinary of what
 
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
I would call the classic academic
 
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
College president there are two things
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
that impressed me uh that uh I I think
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
will serve the university well as you
 
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
the service experience
 
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
The Faculty instruction the integration
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
with the faculty I've been a faculty
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
member at Saint anselves prologue type
 
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
uh a bit of the post-secondary education
 
00:36:59.210 --> 00:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
for most of my adult life
 
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
but I think the fact that that there's
 
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
an integration situation with the
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
faculty gives the student a a much
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
better opportunity to not only learn but
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
to progress
 
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.550 align:start position:0%
to progress
and

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
without that I I I think we we're losing
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
something so
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
very very interested in that the um
 
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
the wrap-up course
 
00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
when I was at UNH we had La 51 which was
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh just like what you're uh what you're
 
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.609 align:start position:0%
uh just like what you're uh what you're
articulating

00:37:34.609 --> 00:37:34.619 align:start position:0%
articulating
 
00:37:37.609 --> 00:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
it was a course that that brought music
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
brought aren't
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
but the community part brought
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
everything together and I was I was uh
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
really uh
 
00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:50.339 align:start position:0%
it's excited by the course the the
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
problem is it only lasted one semester
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
I mean those things should last
 
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
throughout your entire college
 
00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.550 align:start position:0%
throughout your entire college
experience

00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
um I would like to see what your
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
attrition rate is based on this this
 
00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:04.670 align:start position:0%
attrition rate is based on this this
formula

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:38:08.089 --> 00:38:08.099 align:start position:0%
and what it was Prior what it what it is
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
what it is now
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
uh because getting a student is
 
00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
difficult I was director of admissions I
 
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
would tell you but that Southern New
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire University getting him as one
 
00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
thing retaining of something else if all
 
00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
of these things are in play you should
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
have a better success rate in terms of
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
rotating kits and if you're retaining
 
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.349 align:start position:0%
rotating kits and if you're retaining
kids

00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
their their desire to stay here is
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
probably intensified because we want
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
them to stay in New Hampshire oh I I'd
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
really like to see some data
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
on the results of this now he's been
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
he's been there eight years yeah eight
 
00:38:49.609 --> 00:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
years now so he's probably had one real
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
graduating class because it takes six
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
years right so he's had one graduating
 
00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.569 align:start position:0%
years right so he's had one graduating
class

00:38:56.569 --> 00:38:56.579 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:38:59.210 --> 00:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
what's the attrition rate what's this
 
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
what's the success with the preliminary
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
success rate in terms of a their ability
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
to get a job opportunity but secondarily
 
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
did they stay here in New Hampshire
 
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
was there enough done in terms of
 
00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.099 align:start position:0%
helping them to get a good situation in
 
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and rotating the New
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh that's that's a problem
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
that we have witnessed or I've witnessed
 
00:39:28.089 --> 00:39:28.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
we see an outward migration rate of of
 
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
young kids but with these in place they
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
should they should make a significant
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
impact on our ability to retain students
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
the the exciting things that are being
 
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
created and I don't want to go out
 
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
because others want to speak but the
 
00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:52.510 align:start position:0%
because others want to speak but the
exciting

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
exciting
 
00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
the exciting situation that's being
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
created in Via Chester with deed cabin
 
00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
I I do a few things with with the deed
 
00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.270 align:start position:0%
I I do a few things with with the deed
cable

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
cable
 
00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
but that opportunity
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the in the real world to do really
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
good things
 
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
should right across the board you know
 
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
these kinds of things remaining in New
 
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are being created retaining
 
00:40:20.089 --> 00:40:20.099 align:start position:0%
not only being retained here but
 
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
expanding here should create opportunity
 
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
so two quick responses I don't want to
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
monopolize but we both said
 
00:40:29.569 --> 00:40:29.579 align:start position:0%
simultaneously the data speaks for
 
00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:32.339 align:start position:0%
itself so we know uh not just here I
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
mean again there's National Data on this
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
that students that engage in these
 
00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:38.099 align:start position:0%
practices but you are right to say well
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
show me a Plymouth state that that's the
 
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
case and we can one of the challenges
 
00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
for president Burks having said that is
 
00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
this little thing happened a few years
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
into his time right and so the data's
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
been affected by that but we know that
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
even having said that that we were up by
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
about almost 10 percent from when he
 
00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
arrived our retention rate has improved
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
closing in on 70 percent which compared
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
to our comparators is quite High you
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
know obviously it's it's not an R1
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
University it's not an ivy so we don't
 
00:41:10.609 --> 00:41:10.619 align:start position:0%
that's not a relevant comparison but to
 
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
our comparators we've improved by almost
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
10 percent which is significant your
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
second point about keeping our students
 
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
where they belong well we serve we I
 
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
don't this semester 43 of our incoming
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
class are first generation students from
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's a significant
 
00:41:29.569 --> 00:41:29.579 align:start position:0%
impact those are students you know that
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
this is we're making a difference we are
 
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for them and one of the
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
reasons we're so committed to this kind
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
of work getting students out of the
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
classroom into the community is so that
 
00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:41.339 align:start position:0%
they're connected so that they have
 
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
those connections so I just shook hands
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
like you did at commencement with kids
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
who I've met who've engaged in these
 
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
things Gorham paper mill they're going
 
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
back to their communities you know who
 
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
did they think they thanked Plymouth
 
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
State and their parents and the White
 
00:41:56.569 --> 00:41:56.579 align:start position:0%
Mountains who inspire me every day to
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
serve the state of New Hampshire I mean
 
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
I had a student say that to me it's so I
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
do think
 
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
um tracking the data on employment is
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
something we also work on so we can
 
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:08.339 align:start position:0%
report on that as well if
 
00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
if I could just add one additional data
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
point for you you know at UNH we pay
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
very close attention to if a student
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
does an internship or a community
 
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
engagement exercise like this and they
 
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
come from out of state they are twice as
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
likely to stay in the state and work in
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
the state sixty percent of the students
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
that do an internship or community
 
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
service project in the state when they
 
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
cost additional tuition money in the
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
part of the student or how are they paid
 
00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.609 align:start position:0%
part of the student or how are they paid
for

00:42:43.609 --> 00:42:43.619 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
um no the students never pay more our
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
students can't and we don't want them to
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's not this is supposed to be
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
value-added for everyone involved so we
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
go out of our way institutionally we
 
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
have to expend labor and make the
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
connections and and make sure that all
 
00:42:59.809 --> 00:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
the legal bases are covered risk
 
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
management issues are dealt with right
 
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
if we're sending our students out we
 
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
have to be responsible to those things
 
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
so it's not a free by any means but it's
 
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
worth it to us and to our students the
 
00:43:10.849 --> 00:43:10.859 align:start position:0%
value added
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
just put a few more numbers on it I the
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
biggest investment we make is actually
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
creating the structures that bring us
 
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
One-Stop shop for companies to come to
 
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
us and for communities to come to us
 
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
with these challenges so at UNH we have
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
2 700 New Hampshire companies
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
that are working with our career and
 
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
professional success office many of them
 
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
it's paid many of them it's not it's
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's a mix of whether they pay the
 
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
student or not and we navigate that
 
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
space the key is to give them a One-Stop
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
shop I need help I would like to engage
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
with students you know can you put me in
 
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
touch with the right Department with the
 
00:43:47.089 --> 00:43:47.099 align:start position:0%
right faculty member with the right
 
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
program and that's that's where we make
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
actually uh
 
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
Senator Del Sandro asked my question I
 
00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:02.579 align:start position:0%
was going to happen but you just
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
prompted another one with the success
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
that you've had of having students stay
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
in the state I would suggest that you
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
meet with our budget committee
 
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:14.220 align:start position:0%
and bring those stories to the budget
 
00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.230 align:start position:0%
and bring those stories to the budget
committee

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
because particularly as you begin to
 
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
look at the whole issue of the Workforce
 
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
Development within the state Kathy can
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
you respond to that the
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question and
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
actually our budget request
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
was specifically targeted for Plymouth
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
and Keene to stand up more opportunities
 
00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:37.940 align:start position:0%
for internship and Community engagement
 
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
UNH invested its own dollars half a
 
00:44:44.809 --> 00:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
dozen years ago and has built the
 
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure they have more internship
 
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
opportunities at UNH than they have
 
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.050 align:start position:0%
opportunities at UNH than they have
students

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
that will or can take them but it takes
 
00:44:59.089 --> 00:44:59.099 align:start position:0%
investment for Plymouth and Keen
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
to to stand up that engine if you will
 
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
and to work with business partners right
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
there's has to be an infrastructure
 
00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
there so that was a big part of our
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
budget request
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
this is the follow-up it would seem to
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
me that if you have I'm not sure whether
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
you had any students come before the
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
budget committee to talk about their
 
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
experience because I think that's
 
00:45:26.569 --> 00:45:26.579 align:start position:0%
important as well as the businesses that
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
they've been working with so that so
 
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
that our legislature here begins to
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
understand not just from a theoretical
 
00:45:33.359 --> 00:45:34.730 align:start position:0%
understand not just from a theoretical
standpoint

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
or an esoteric standpoint but a
 
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
practical standpoint of how these hip
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
programs are in fact engaging students
 
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
and then staying in the state because
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
that's obviously is we know it's a huge
 
00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
issue here and we need to understand
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
that from a legislative standpoint of
 
00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
what the return on investment is as we
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
begin to deal with these programs
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
are you awake
 
00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:02.099 align:start position:0%
was in the legislature right now
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing
 
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
how's that Wicked program impacting
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
these students which are coming out of
 
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
unh Plymouth State Keene State and the
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
community college system in terms of
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
finding housing
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
yes it's huge everywhere I mean I and I
 
00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
think it's interesting so yes it's a big
 
00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
problem we know that and I think one of
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
the interesting things is the different
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
ways that within the system we're trying
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
to to address it to or to support and
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
addressing it so what you were saying
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
yeah it's also a challenge it's an
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
enormous challenge it's an enormous
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
challenge for current students that want
 
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
to do an internship with a company in
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
the North country and can't because they
 
00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
don't have a place to stay or they're
 
00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
trying to do something in Manchester
 
00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
they prefer to live in Manchester while
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
they're finishing their degree in in
 
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
Durham the other place where we have an
 
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
enormous challenge is recruiting
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
students in at The Graduate level these
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
are professional Masters MBA uh Masters
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
in health care those students want to
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
come to the state they want to get this
 
00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
higher education
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
um but when they come they can't afford
 
00:47:08.329 --> 00:47:08.339 align:start position:0%
to live here certainly within some of
 
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
those regions so the same thing that our
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
companies are seeing the universities
 
00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
are seeing as well and we're trying to
 
00:47:14.569 --> 00:47:14.579 align:start position:0%
find new ways to address it and I would
 
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
say it's heightened where we are in
 
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and not that it's not difficult
 
00:47:20.809 --> 00:47:20.819 align:start position:0%
where I've had tremendous difficulty
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
recruiting faculty and staff again the
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
students have their own set of issues
 
00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
with that but my ability to bring top
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
quality people to Plymouth State when I
 
00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:32.579 align:start position:0%
have such limited housing opportunities
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
for them that are affordable and
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
accessible and close to campus that's
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
been a huge challenge for us
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
our some partnership with the community
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
college system
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
um we have a new robotics program that
 
00:49:56.569 --> 00:49:56.579 align:start position:0%
was one of the visions of President
 
00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
Burks uh and I've just hired a new
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
leader of the program he's joining us
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
he's trying to find a place to live one
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
of his challenges uh but the robotics
 
00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
program is a perfect example of again
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
Don's vision of we don't want
 
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
straightforward one program departments
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's not how we work we don't have
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
departments but we have these clusters
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
and the robotics program integrates game
 
00:50:22.849 --> 00:50:22.859 align:start position:0%
design you know manufacturing and
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
Robotics computer science graphic all
 
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
the other elements that go into we also
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
have a game design program which
 
00:50:31.849 --> 00:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
integrates computer science and Robotics
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
and storytelling right all so these
 
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
kinds of programs they're tremendously
 
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
powerful and we know that it's part so
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
we're building programs to address those
 
00:50:42.119 --> 00:50:43.430 align:start position:0%
we're building programs to address those
things

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
um what's interesting about it is that
 
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
the way that AI AI computer science data
 
00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:52.940 align:start position:0%
science data analytics and Robotics
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
there's a whole Spectrum where they can
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
there those need to be leveraged and
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
applied so the work you're doing in the
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
community college system is incredibly
 
00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
important important we need people who
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
can go in and and do what needs to be
 
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
done at a very applied level on you know
 
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
in uh Manufacturing Systems for example
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
That's essential and then okay so what's
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
the next step what about programming in
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
a manufacturing facility what about
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
building robots implicating what about
 
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
designing what about the programming
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
that goes behind that work and that
 
00:51:29.569 --> 00:51:29.579 align:start position:0%
scales up so I think there's a role for
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
the community colleges places like
 
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State and then R1 universities
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're doing The Cutting Edge so I
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
think there's multiple answers to the
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
question that you ask and the answers
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
are going to come from all of us in
 
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
different ways so the follow-up on that
 
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
Rick and thanks for for uh for talking
 
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
about this and
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
um it reminds me of the conversation I
 
00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
had with Mark a couple years ago too
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
when I think we were over on the nhci
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
campus and you said what can what can
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
our students be doing to help you in the
 
00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:05.099 align:start position:0%
legislature so so some of the wicked
 
00:52:08.329 --> 00:52:08.339 align:start position:0%
problems that that that you know we
 
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
confront here uh obviously policy
 
00:52:16.569 --> 00:52:16.579 align:start position:0%
related and we're using um
 
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
decades-old tools to try to solve those
 
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
like you know Excel spreadsheets and
 
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
things like that to try to model what
 
00:52:29.089 --> 00:52:29.099 align:start position:0%
this means and um and an example that I
 
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
think you know several of us here
 
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
probably familiar with is school funding
 
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
and um Rick you and I spent spent a ton
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
of really good valuable time but but
 
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:43.140 align:start position:0%
we're basically using you know linear
 
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
models on you know what does this mean
 
00:52:49.849 --> 00:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
for um for districts and the number of
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
of English language Learners or free and
 
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch kids and stuff like
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
that but there's so many other factors
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
that come into play now too and um and
 
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
and I think this is one of the things
 
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
Mark and I talked about I mean you know
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
school funding policy translates right
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
down into tax balls and I know that can
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
be a bad word around here but you know
 
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
but that's that's State funding so so
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
homeowners that own property less than
 
00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.099 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars or
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
homeowners that own property more than
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
two million dollars or homeowners that
 
00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
own property manufactured housing or or
 
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
living in apartments and we have that
 
00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
data now it's a massive data set yep but
 
00:53:42.130 --> 00:53:42.140 align:start position:0%
I think it's probably beyond the
 
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
capacity of of Rick and I to to to model
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
model the effects
 
00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
um on that and and probably would be
 
00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
asking too much of the budget office to
 
00:53:55.800 --> 00:54:03.490 align:start position:0%
asking too much of the budget office to
um

00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:03.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
are some of these things which and you
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
know I think in the state of New
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public school funding has been
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
the wicked problem that we have not been
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
able to solve
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
um and part of that is Will to solve it
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
but Paul part of it is how to solve it
 
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
and um and you know and you know and and
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
I think this is an area where where
 
00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
clearly as as as as people who live here
 
00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we're all interested
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
people who have had kids grow up in New
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're all interested and then
 
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
obviously from a from a um from a
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
business side you know the community
 
00:54:43.849 --> 00:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
colleges and the and the university
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
system certainly have an interest in
 
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
kids succeeding
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
um in in K-12
 
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
um and uh making sure that the uh the
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
the 13 000 kids in Manchester are having
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
the same opportunities of success as the
 
00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
Thousand kids at Hopkins I mean you know
 
00:55:08.089 --> 00:55:08.099 align:start position:0%
I I I'm used with Patty Cornell was
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
around the table here she knows that I
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
always use Manchester sometimes she
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
winces a little bit
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
um but uh but you know New Hampshire has
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
more homeless kids than Hopkinton has
 
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
kids in the in the in the K-12 system so
 
00:55:24.049 --> 00:55:24.059 align:start position:0%
you know how do you solve that Wicked
 
00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:26.579 align:start position:0%
problem and uh to make sure that these
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
kits have the have the same
 
00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:30.839 align:start position:0%
opportunities as the other students in
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester and the other students in
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
Hanover and Hopkinton and um
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
and and when I'm talking about
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
opportunities too I'm talking about
 
00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
opportunities for Success so the average
 
00:55:44.089 --> 00:55:44.099 align:start position:0%
student in Manchester performs at the
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
fourth percentile Statewide
 
00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
so 96 percent of students in New
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire perform better than the
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
average student in Manchester
 
00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
so you know you know that that's an
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity not just for the for the you
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
know for the kids to I mean you know a
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
fourth percentile outcome is a great you
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
know isn't a strong outcome but
 
00:56:11.089 --> 00:56:11.099 align:start position:0%
um even though we have you know strong
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
outcomes Statewide in New Hampshire but
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh but you know what does this mean for
 
00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
our economy what does this mean for the
 
00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:18.770 align:start position:0%
our economy what does this mean for the
the

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
um you know you know this type of
 
00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
learning model
 
00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
um uh if uh if if if if we can you know
 
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
move the needle in some of these places
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
by look by solving
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
that Wicked problem then it starts to
 
00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
help solve a lot of other Wicked
 
00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.609 align:start position:0%
help solve a lot of other Wicked
problems

00:56:39.609 --> 00:56:39.619 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
a huge one there representative but you
 
00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:45.260 align:start position:0%
know there is another Wicked problem
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
that I heard the senator to my left
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
speak to at the finance committee the
 
00:56:53.809 --> 00:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
other day and that's Civics education K
 
00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
through 12. and I don't know where the
 
00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
Senate is on that right now Lou whether
 
00:56:59.809 --> 00:56:59.819 align:start position:0%
you've dropped it from two to one
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars but
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
um it's a wicked problem it needs
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
resolution whether we're going to come
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
up with what I think the senator wants
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
to see is a textbook and this
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative wants to see the same
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
thing not we're kind of old-fashioned
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
but uh there needs to be something in
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
front of the student but how how could
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
we utilize these programs that you have
 
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about
 
00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:25.740 align:start position:0%
and rather than are having to contract
 
00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
some service out to somebody out in
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
Arizona to write our Civics program
 
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
could we not be using what what we have
 
00:57:38.089 --> 00:57:38.099 align:start position:0%
on board within various departments uh
 
00:57:40.609 --> 00:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
as part of this this
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
Wicked problem hip type programming
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
to get to that end point we want
 
00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.490 align:start position:0%
to get to that end point we want
without

00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
with the the means that we have to pay
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
for it I
 
00:57:55.069 --> 00:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
I you might want to talk more about that
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
Lou but I think we have to really talk
 
00:57:58.130 --> 00:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
about how we're going to develop the
 
00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
Civics K through 12 program right that
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
we drastically need in the state of New
 
00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:06.589 align:start position:0%
we drastically need in the state of New
Hampshire

00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.089 --> 00:58:08.099 align:start position:0%
well it's not there's certainly no
 
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
question that we share at the same view
 
00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:11.809 align:start position:0%
question that we share at the same view
uh

00:58:11.809 --> 00:58:11.819 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
K-12 is is where the action should be
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
but let me uh refer representative
 
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
talked about Manchester I served on the
 
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester school board for 10 years
 
00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
Committee of the Baychester school board
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
and I I have a I have a district where I
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
have eight minority schools eight
 
00:58:32.569 --> 00:58:32.579 align:start position:0%
minority schools I I guess in the rest
 
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
of the state they probably had eight
 
00:58:37.609 --> 00:58:37.619 align:start position:0%
minority schools district
 
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
what is that what does that mean that
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
means blacks and Hispanics represent
 
00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
more than 50 percent of the enrollment
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
that's a challenge both for the district
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
for what's beyond the district
 
00:58:58.510 --> 00:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
I was looking at truancy rates yesterday
 
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
uh and I was looking at attendance rates
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
we have the oldest public high school in
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire beatchester
 
00:59:07.849 --> 00:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
High School Central the attendance rate
 
00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:10.040 align:start position:0%
78 percent
 
00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
78 percent
 
00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
graduation rate at Manchester High
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
School West which has 737 students my
 
00:59:19.849 --> 00:59:19.859 align:start position:0%
children all went to West my wife went
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
to West my kids went through the BHS
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
assistant K through 12.
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
has a graduation rate of 60 percent
 
00:59:30.049 --> 00:59:30.059 align:start position:0%
60 percent
 
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
the highest graduation rate in the city
 
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
is at Memorial I think it's 80 percent a
 
00:59:38.569 --> 00:59:38.579 align:start position:0%
little bit higher than 80 percent so
 
00:59:40.849 --> 00:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the the things that
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
are happening at the post-secondary
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
level you're right what about K-12 and
 
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:47.220 align:start position:0%
I've been around here for a long time I
 
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
was I was on the committee of conference
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
on the first education funding piece of
 
00:59:57.250 --> 00:59:57.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:01.140 align:start position:0%
if if we don't address that situation
 
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh where are the youngsters that we're
 
01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
we're we're hoping for them our future
 
01:00:07.849 --> 01:00:07.859 align:start position:0%
where are they where are they going to
 
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
go and how are they going to get there
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
how are they going to get there that's
 
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
that's that's my concern it's Civics I
 
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
taught Civics I say this all the time
 
01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
one of my Civic students was a secretary
 
01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:23.339 align:start position:0%
of state August serving secretary of
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
state in the United States I had him at
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
the ninth grade
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
I had the Speaker of the House in the
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
ninth grade I had Alex Ray in the ninth
 
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
grade pretty successful people
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
all right what do you think of it uh
 
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
I was teaching Civics in those days
 
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
and it meant something because of the
 
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
involvement of of these people I think
 
01:00:47.569 --> 01:00:47.579 align:start position:0%
that's where we have to we have to get a
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
grasp of that I
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
I know how important it is we had a
 
01:00:54.049 --> 01:00:54.059 align:start position:0%
chance a number of years ago I would say
 
01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:55.700 align:start position:0%
probably in
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
1978-1980 when August delivered a
 
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
formula that phobia that would have
 
01:01:02.809 --> 01:01:02.819 align:start position:0%
solved that problem
 
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
it would have solved that problem it was
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
vetoed by the governor
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
it was vetoed by the governor and as a
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
result of that we've gone this way with
 
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
education ever since
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're in court right now
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
we may lose that suit I think it's more
 
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
likely to lose it than that but what's
 
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
going to happen if you lose it they turn
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
it back to the lead selection so here we
 
01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.370 align:start position:0%
it back to the lead selection so here we
are

01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:29.569 align:start position:0%
are
um

01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:29.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
I like what's happening at the
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
post-secondary level but the base
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
it is like where it's at the base is
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
how do we how do we face face up to that
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
and how does this post-secondary play a
 
01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:52.619 align:start position:0%
role in helping us you know it's a part
 
01:01:55.609 --> 01:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
of early school we we used to have
 
01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:57.980 align:start position:0%
keyed state
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
students come and do their practical at
 
01:02:03.289 --> 01:02:03.299 align:start position:0%
partner voting I don't know if we'd have
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
that any any more but we need that kind
 
01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
of we need that kind of help we need
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
that kind of integration and and uh how
 
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
what better social experience is there
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
than to come to a place like Manchester
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
which which is beatchester is an urban
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
center it's not the old VHS that I came
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
to you know 50 something years ago when
 
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
I was teaching high school at Bishop
 
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
Bradley high school it's a different
 
01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
worlds though
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh we we have social workers in all of
 
01:02:35.329 --> 01:02:35.339 align:start position:0%
our River schools
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
social workers I mean these are the
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
Deeds that have that are being
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
manifested and
 
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
you know extend that
 
01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
to the post-secondary level where these
 
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
kids where are these kids going to end
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
up they don't go to they don't go to
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
plymouth's key UNH they don't go to the
 
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
Community College I don't know where
 
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
they're going
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
but they're certainly not being prepared
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
properly to go any place okay that's
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
dangerous and that's what we that's what
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
we face with all the glaring
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities that are available talk
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
about cabin cable tells me he needs 4
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
000 workers
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
he could Hire 4 000 people
 
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
he needs 200 Engineers graduated
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire our
 
01:03:23.809 --> 01:03:23.819 align:start position:0%
engineering school one of the best in
 
01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
the country
 
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
are those Engineers gravitating you know
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
to to Manchester the other problem is
 
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
exists but but I think K-12 and I know
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
a gentleman on this stage have spent a
 
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
lifetime working on it well I've spent a
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
lifetime working on I've been involved
 
01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
in it teaching and I still live in the
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
same house 51 years later all right
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
bought it for a very big resistance I I
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
tell people my mortgage was 148 a month
 
01:03:56.049 --> 01:03:56.059 align:start position:0%
and I had trouble making it
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
because I was working at a school and I
 
01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
was getting 5 000 bucks a year as my
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
salary so
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
the problem space is the problem that
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
faces us they looked at the numbers
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
30 000 free breakfasts in beer Chester
 
01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:16.700 align:start position:0%
30 000 free breakfasts
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand free and reduced price
 
01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
lurches does that tell you how poor uh
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
the city has the city is would you have
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
that kind of that kind of a situation 78
 
01:04:31.609 --> 01:04:31.619 align:start position:0%
attendance rate highest at interest
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
rates are the the quality areas of
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
Beatrice so that I we got to start there
 
01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
we've got to start there and that's
 
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's a whole Dental situation that's
 
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
got that's got to chase we gotta we
 
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
gotta excite people about the about how
 
01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
meaningful it is how meaningful it is
 
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
and how important it is
 
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh it's I think as I say it starts K
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
through 12 and then it goes over and uh
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
we can do a lot at the post-secondary
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
level I think a lot has been done but
 
01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
indeed the Corpus keeps shrieking
 
01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
you get fewer graduates yeah if you were
 
01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.589 align:start position:0%
you get fewer graduates yeah if you were
numbers

01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
I and I think uh the kids that that
 
01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
you're getting if there are kids so need
 
01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
need more help they just they just need
 
01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
more help so maybe Senator we can have a
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
response from the universities but I
 
01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
also like to hear you know maybe some
 
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
input on where the senator is coming
 
01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
from in terms of the community college
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
system so Wayne why don't you go first
 
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
and then uh and then the chancellor sure
 
01:05:38.089 --> 01:05:38.099 align:start position:0%
happy to so so first of all I think a
 
01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
key aspect of all of this is is the
 
01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
partnership and how are we working
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
together I'm delighted that you know we
 
01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
are in your schools you have teachers
 
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
from Keene and Plymouth and and UNH uh
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
in Manchester schools literally the
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
president and I and our team was over at
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
uh one of the minority serving schools
 
01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:56.339 align:start position:0%
on the on the east side I don't remember
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
the name of the school off the top of my
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
head last week
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
um as part of our Embrace New Hampshire
 
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.549 align:start position:0%
um as part of our Embrace New Hampshire
tour

01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
tour
 
01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
um in general and I'll go back to uh
 
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
representative luno's comment earlier
 
01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
just like we have a mechanism in place
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
where companies can come to us and say
 
01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
we have a wicked problem do you have a
 
01:06:17.329 --> 01:06:17.339 align:start position:0%
student a team that could work on this
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
whether that be marketing or analytics
 
01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
or AI that exists for communities as
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
well and we do work with communities on
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
everything from marketing to how do they
 
01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
Implement new strategies some of those
 
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
are very successful for example in
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
Manchester we just got the a major NSF
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
award several million dollars to work on
 
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
how do you elevate inner city schools
 
01:06:41.569 --> 01:06:41.579 align:start position:0%
and how do you create new Partnerships
 
01:06:44.089 --> 01:06:44.099 align:start position:0%
that link to social work programs as
 
01:06:45.289 --> 01:06:45.299 align:start position:0%
well as all those other things that you
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
need I think we have to see this more as
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
as a partnership and we'd love to hear
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
you know where would a team of students
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
doing a Capstone project or where would
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
a graduate student and a faculty member
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
working with a couple of others be able
 
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
to provide new insights that would be
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
helpful from data analytics or or other
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
so when you hear about those things
 
01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
we're very interested we're doing many
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
of them but we could do more and so I
 
01:07:13.609 --> 01:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
would say if you hear about them please
 
01:07:16.609 --> 01:07:16.619 align:start position:0%
ask and that includes K-12 I mean we
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
have we have certified teacher programs
 
01:07:20.809 --> 01:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
at Keenan Plymouth that have the
 
01:07:22.849 --> 01:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
expertise to build K-12 commit uh
 
01:07:24.529 --> 01:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
curricula and we should be taking
 
01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
advantage of that and we do everything
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
we work up in the north country and and
 
01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
different areas where we're finding
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and communities in need but
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
yeah there's there's tons of need and
 
01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
more than we can serve so we need to
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
know we're trying to develop capacity
 
01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
where this is we're meeting tomorrow we
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
have a six hour Provost retreat tomorrow
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
and one of our Central focuses is
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
education so this is top on our radar
 
01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
sorry Senator just it was Gossler Park
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
that was where we went gospel Park was
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
where the oldest radio School of the
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
city it's adult as you can see
 
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
but with some great leadership and a
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
number of unh alumni that were there
 
01:08:05.450 --> 01:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
working and we had our faculty there was
 
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
it's equated building it's just the
 
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
physical properties I I visit every
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
school in my district every year
 
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
and uh Joshua Park as I said oldest
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
oldest grade of school in in the city
 
01:08:26.329 --> 01:08:26.339 align:start position:0%
and um the the administrator does a very
 
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
good job she's committed yes it is
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
amazing given the task
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
the task adhered
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
the amazing thing is these schools which
 
01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:36.530 align:start position:0%
the amazing thing is these schools which
we

01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
give that terminology to dump we have
 
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
one in woodswell as well and the
 
01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:43.259 align:start position:0%
teachers and the staff really oftentimes
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
take offense with that due to the fact
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're really doing a great job with
 
01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
the facilities that they have and and
 
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
mastering how to work in that but you're
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct those places are not
 
01:08:57.370 --> 01:08:57.380 align:start position:0%
fit to be teaching in today
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
Chancellor do you can you add something
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
from the community college perspective
 
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
in regard to where we're going with this
 
01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
conversation this is an important
 
01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.289 align:start position:0%
conversation this is an important
conversation

01:09:06.289 --> 01:09:06.299 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
well I'll try yeah I'm I'm reluctant to
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
have her disagree with Senator
 
01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
D'Alessandro but I'm going to take a
 
01:09:16.249 --> 01:09:16.259 align:start position:0%
moment when you say it starts with k
 
01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
through 12 and I would offer that it
 
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
actually starts with Early Childhood
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
before we get to K
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
and I think that's one of the objectives
 
01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to make provide more
 
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
capacity for high quality early
 
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
childhood education and child care which
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
is another Catalyst like Workforce
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
housing that if we can if we can break
 
01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:37.739 align:start position:0%
that Log Jam if we can create that
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
capacity and not simply capacity for
 
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
where children can be while their
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
parents are working but real
 
01:09:48.289 --> 01:09:48.299 align:start position:0%
foundational education that starts them
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
off on better footing that's part of the
 
01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.610 align:start position:0%
off on better footing that's part of the
solution

01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
solution
 
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
um the I've been in the legis with the
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
legislature a number of times where I've
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
referenced the free and reduced lunch
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
data come back to the point that not
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
only is it still more than one in five
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
students across New Hampshire more than
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
40 percent in Manchester but it's not
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
just a reflection of the students it's a
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
reflection of the parents of this
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
generation of school-aged children in
 
01:10:16.729 --> 01:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
their circumstances in this economy in
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
this labor market so can we be doing
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
more simultaneously for that generation
 
01:10:23.649 --> 01:10:23.659 align:start position:0%
nation of working adults to give them
 
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
on-ramps into the workforce at levels
 
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
that will be more consistent with what
 
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
the future of the state's calling for
 
01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:32.450 align:start position:0%
the future of the state's calling for
um

01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
the the other point that I'd like to
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
reference and it ties the two pieces of
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
this conversation together we started a
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
discussion about high impact practices
 
01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
in post-secondary
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
going back to the need for better civic
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
education maybe the best civic education
 
01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
is high impact finding ways to actually
 
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
engage students if there's a state in
 
01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
this country that can actually
 
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrate what a citizen is
 
01:10:58.370 --> 01:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
responsible for what being part of a
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
community means it's New Hampshire and
 
01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if there's not a way that
 
01:11:04.729 --> 01:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
we can develop not just textbooks but
 
01:11:06.649 --> 01:11:06.659 align:start position:0%
but learning experiences that really
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
engage students otherwise to find people
 
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
who are willing to sit in these chairs
 
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
over the next 10 20 30 40 years is going
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
to be harder but for them to understand
 
01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
why you do what you do and what it means
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
to this state I think there's a real
 
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity so I think this conversation
 
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
that we started with with high impact
 
01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.270 align:start position:0%
that we started with with high impact
practices

01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
practices
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
ought to be tied back to the civic
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
education conversation for K-12
 
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
thank you we have several items on the
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
docket here for today and maybe we ought
 
01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
to take a break here this is a topic
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
which you know that I'm glad we had the
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
discussion it there it we can't just
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
drop it but we have uh a number four on
 
01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
our doc here Dr Wayne Jones
 
01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:53.149 align:start position:0%
our doc here Dr Wayne Jones
um

01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
from the University system uh University
 
01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire are talking about
 
01:11:59.570 --> 01:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
alternative Pathways to the bachelor's
 
01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
degree and and it's just not the
 
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree one of the issues
 
01:12:07.149 --> 01:12:07.159 align:start position:0%
which we're dealing with is trying to
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
ensure that more students are coming out
 
01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
of uh K through 12 with industry
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
recognized credentials and
 
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
um that's that basic hard skill that's
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
going to give them that and conform with
 
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
what the industries requesting as being
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
that standard and I'm curious to know
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
Wayne is is that something too that's
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
being emphasized at at your level as
 
01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:36.500 align:start position:0%
well I know that we have
 
01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
it going on our CTE centers and in
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the community college
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
system but I'm curious to know what
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
we're doing with that but I also gave
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
you that article to try to respond to so
 
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
why don't you go ahead with your
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
presentation and we won't throw more at
 
01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.189 align:start position:0%
presentation and we won't throw more at
you

01:12:54.189 --> 01:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
more questions are always welcome uh and
 
01:12:59.570 --> 01:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
and I appreciated the you know sending
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
those the the articles that you did
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
represented the the you know does
 
01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
college take four years is a college
 
01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
degree worth it do we need general
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
education these are actually higher ed
 
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
challenges that are being discussed
 
01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
Nationwide right now in fact literally I
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
I almost grabbed it but it didn't fit in
 
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
my briefcase conveniently The Chronicle
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
of Higher Education came out this month
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
and the cover is about is general
 
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
education really worth it or is it
 
01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.310 align:start position:0%
education really worth it or is it
broken

01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
broken
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
um I think to to provide a little bit of
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
background in context first and then I'm
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
going to address those questions and of
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
course any other questions you want
 
01:13:34.729 --> 01:13:34.739 align:start position:0%
let's just take a step back and look at
 
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
the history of higher education that
 
01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
puts us where we are today you know
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
everyone higher education is as it looks
 
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
today has its basis back in the 1700s
 
01:13:47.209 --> 01:13:47.219 align:start position:0%
and even as late as the 1900s and 1950
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
it looked very similar the difference
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
was it was really targeted at Elite
 
01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
Institute Elite institutions it was
 
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
targeted Elite the belief was that only
 
01:13:57.890 --> 01:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
about 10 percent of students would get a
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
college degree uh that changed after
 
01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:02.900 align:start position:0%
World War II and the GI bill
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
massification of higher education uh
 
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
unreal universities grew up all over the
 
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
place small colleges became parts of
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
State systems uh we went big in the 60s
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
it shifted again and the shift in the
 
01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
60s was away from What was seen as
 
01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
providing that Elite Education for
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
everyone to professionalizing how do we
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have professional
 
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:28.140 align:start position:0%
schools professional engineering degrees
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
got new levels of of growth Health Care
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
degrees education schools of Education
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
all that professionalization came in
 
01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
uh if you fast forward a little bit uh
 
01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
you you moved to uh into the 90s and
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
into 2000 2010 what you see is now
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
everybody wants the degree you go from
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
20 of students applying for a college
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
degree to 50 60 and as a result you get
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
new players in the market you get
 
01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
privates online coming in
 
01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
after 2015 and now after the pandemic it
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
looks much different it looks different
 
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
for a couple of reasons one declining
 
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
High School graduation rates
 
01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
particularly in the Northeast more
 
01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
importantly culturally students are
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
saying hey I can do things differently
 
01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
uh in a recent in a recent poll that was
 
01:15:22.970 --> 01:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
quoted in this article it talked about
 
01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
how only 41 percent of high school
 
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
seniors said it was very likely that
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
they were going to go to college
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
60 percent of those students said that
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
their most likely path was to start
 
01:15:32.689 --> 01:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
their own business and become an
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
entrepreneur fifty percent said they
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
were going to become social influencers
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not commenting on those but the
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
point is the culture has shifted in what
 
01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
the students think they want we're also
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
at a time where many fewer students are
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
going right into college they're taking
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
Gap years funded by their parents in
 
01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
some cases Senator comment that uh
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
jokingly on that earlier
 
01:15:58.490 --> 01:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
um it's a different environment in that
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
space we also have the challenge that
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
employment has gone from you know in the
 
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
70s in in 2007 2008 employment
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment was high many places States
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
turned on requirements for bachelor's
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
degrees because they needed to thin out
 
01:16:16.850 --> 01:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
their pools because everybody was
 
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
applying for these jobs now they're
 
01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
going the other way now they're turning
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
them off unemployment is too low maybe
 
01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
we don't need a bachelor's degree for
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
you to be able to work in the motor pool
 
01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
or for you to be able to work in other
 
01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:29.950 align:start position:0%
or for you to be able to work in other
aspects

01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
aspects
 
01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
universities today are trying to adapt
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
to that environment at the core of that
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
I think is what I'll call integration
 
01:16:39.649 --> 01:16:39.659 align:start position:0%
for life there's a recognition that
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
universities don't just provide content
 
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
for 18 to 24 year olds in that period
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
right after high school in fact we
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
should be providing support for
 
01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
individuals throughout their lives and
 
01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
we should be providing uh the the
 
01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
content and that expertise in a manner
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
that is flexible I would say there's
 
01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
four key aspects of what higher
 
01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
education is trying to drive today and
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm proud to say that all of the
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
campuses in the community in usnh and
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
our partners in the community college
 
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
system are doing the same thing we're
 
01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
trying to create more flexible degree
 
01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:12.229 align:start position:0%
trying to create more flexible degree
pathways

01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
pathways
 
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
do you need a four-year degree no you
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
can get your degree in three years six
 
01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
percent of students last year at UNH
 
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
graduated in three years
 
01:17:24.169 --> 01:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
15 of students could have chose not to
 
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
they chose to finish and to get more
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
credits than they needed they need 120
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
credits to graduate the average at UNH
 
01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
is like 138. we're not requiring it
 
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
they're choosing it because they wanted
 
01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
to do double majors and triple majors
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
um Partnerships with employers is
 
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
absolutely key
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
all disciplines in the University system
 
01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
go through disciplinary accreditation
 
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
which is highly rigorous every five
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
years we get reviewed by our peers
 
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
across the country saying are we
 
01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
teaching the right things are they
 
01:17:57.649 --> 01:17:57.659 align:start position:0%
lining up with what is needed nationally
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
um that's not enough because employers
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
have specific needs and different
 
01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
aspects they've emphasized soft skills
 
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:06.659 align:start position:0%
much more the work in high impact I'm
 
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
learning that that my colleague just
 
01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
spoke about is absolutely critical to
 
01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
that they're working in teams they're
 
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
working on interdisciplinary problems
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's not just about being an engineer
 
01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
you have to know how to work with the
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
the business professional with the
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
marketing and design person and the
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
communications person to solve a problem
 
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
they're much more interdisciplinary
 
01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary education is is where
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
it's at you see that we have many more
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
students it was amazing at commencement
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago to listen all the students
 
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
walking across with double major this
 
01:18:41.209 --> 01:18:41.219 align:start position:0%
and double major that at UNH we just
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
shifted our graduation instead of doing
 
01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
the monster ceremony in uh in the
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
football stadium which many of you have
 
01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
been to uh we now do it by college a
 
01:18:51.649 --> 01:18:51.659 align:start position:0%
more intimate environment and yet many
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
of the students said well I'm getting a
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
degree from Paul College for business
 
01:18:57.169 --> 01:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
and the College of liberal arts
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
can I go twice do I have to go twice
 
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
um that interdisciplinarity also shows
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
up in they want to provide different
 
01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
ways of representing the skills they've
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
learned they want to be an engineer but
 
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
they want to have a language as well or
 
01:19:14.689 --> 01:19:14.699 align:start position:0%
they want to get their degree in
 
01:19:17.209 --> 01:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
business but they'd like to have music
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
as part of their degree
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
and now the university is is challenged
 
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
with how do we curate that how do we
 
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
help the students recognize that there's
 
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
connections maybe let them develop those
 
01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
connections and then curate that a
 
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
couple ways of doing that obviously the
 
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
registrars are all over that but Micro
 
01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
credentials micro certifications are
 
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
something that about five years ago the
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
system embraced uh aggressively and can
 
01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
the valley who leads our extension
 
01:19:47.209 --> 01:19:47.219 align:start position:0%
program in every corner of the state now
 
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
has literally a hundred different micro
 
01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:50.630 align:start position:0%
has literally a hundred different micro
Prudential

01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
Prudential
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
programs that students can take
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
um but anyone in the state could take
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
you don't have to get a degree you can
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
take a certificate or a weekend Workshop
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
or put together two courses to make your
 
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
own micro credential that demonstrates a
 
01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
certain skill set
 
01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
that's where higher education is going
 
01:20:10.729 --> 01:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
today those are the types of things that
 
01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
we're working through and we're
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
certainly not doing it in a vacuum
 
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
because even in addition to our our own
 
01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
accreditation that we go through with
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
our peers
 
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
companies are key part of that every
 
01:20:24.050 --> 01:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
college at UNH as well as my colleagues
 
01:20:25.729 --> 01:20:25.739 align:start position:0%
at Keenan Plymouth have industrial
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
advisory boards that are part of that
 
01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
leadership team that meet with the dean
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
meet with the department chair saying do
 
01:20:33.649 --> 01:20:33.659 align:start position:0%
we have the right skills has it changed
 
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
in five years how did the pandemic
 
01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
change it so those are the conversations
 
01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
we're actively having those were touched
 
01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
on in these articles very very
 
01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:44.090 align:start position:0%
on in these articles very very
appropriately

01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
um I would say you know
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
there's lots and lots of evidence that
 
01:20:53.689 --> 01:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
employers uh are struggling as well not
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
just because of the the demand and the
 
01:20:58.130 --> 01:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
the low unemployment rate but also
 
01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
because today's students
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
have taken what happened naturally and
 
01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
culturally where you got a job at I
 
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
remember I got an internship at IBM When
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
I Was An undergraduate I was told oh
 
01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
you're set you're going to work for them
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
for 40 years
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
well that culture shifted but students
 
01:21:16.970 --> 01:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
today are taking it further employers
 
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
today report back that they're seeing
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
that students want to take their first
 
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
job and only stay there for a year or
 
01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
two and then take a jump and maybe take
 
01:21:27.410 --> 01:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
a six-month gap between jobs before they
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
go to the next job
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons we see some
 
01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
employers creating their own training
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
programs because if you go work for
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
Google and they train you on whatever
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
their their software or their process is
 
01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
you can't then leave them and
 
01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
necessarily translate that directly to
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
another job
 
01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
we've had students I won't name the
 
01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
student or the company but I will tell
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
you have a graduate student at UNH when
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
I brought there the student had been on
 
01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
the books for 12 years to get their
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
degree what the heck are they doing I
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
dug into it right because I want to get
 
01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
our time to degree as short as possible
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
the story was the individual was getting
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
a master's degree an opportunity to do
 
01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
an internship in their last semester
 
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
went to the company to do the internship
 
01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:14.630 align:start position:0%
went to the company to do the internship
and

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
never came back to finish their degree
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
all they had to do was write like 50
 
01:22:21.290 --> 01:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
more pages and defend their thesis and
 
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
they would get their degree and they
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
weren't coming back for 12 years
 
01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm like well let's go just go talk
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
to their manager their manager must want
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
them to get their degree they've been
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
promoting them they've been giving them
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
big raises and the response from the
 
01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
manager was
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
if he gets his degree he'll probably
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
leave I don't want him to get his degree
 
01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
I want to keep him too busy
 
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the mindset that
 
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
we're in that's what we're trying to
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
deal with and be flexible with as we
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
respond to the market
 
01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
I think I'll stop my comments there and
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
dig into whatever aspect of that you
 
01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
would most like to speak to
 
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
so much to that represent Myler yes what
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
role do students play in the development
 
01:23:03.169 --> 01:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
of your programs
 
01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
students play an active role in many of
 
01:23:08.090 --> 01:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
the programs uh usually through advisory
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
boards every college has a student
 
01:23:11.689 --> 01:23:11.699 align:start position:0%
Advisory board that works within many
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
departments do as well
 
01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.169 align:start position:0%
departments do as well
um

01:23:15.169 --> 01:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
I would say that we also find more
 
01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
students participating in
 
01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
the co-curricular activity so the high
 
01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
impact practices every one of our
 
01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
universities have both first year and
 
01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
Capstone programs so for example if you
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
go to UNH and you go into the
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
engineering school we have the
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
Innovation Scholars Program
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
this is a program designed for students
 
01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
day one first day as a freshman you can
 
01:23:40.490 --> 01:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
get involved in a research project and
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
you helped to set what that project is
 
01:23:44.689 --> 01:23:44.699 align:start position:0%
going to be our honors students do the
 
01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
same thing they have a community service
 
01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
project we don't tell them what they're
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
going to work on they tell us what they
 
01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
want to work on they learn what skills
 
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
they need and it's our job to try and
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
help find that skill set to give them
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
support whether that be having an
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
entrepreneur in Residence that comes in
 
01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
from the community or finding the right
 
01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
types of training that the students need
 
01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:08.219 align:start position:0%
so they're pretty actively involved
 
01:24:10.490 --> 01:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
um and they're constantly pushing us
 
01:24:12.649 --> 01:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
yeah I would just just to add to that
 
01:24:12.659 --> 01:24:13.729 align:start position:0%
yeah I would just just to add to that
right

01:24:13.729 --> 01:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
um there's two ways I mean obviously
 
01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
students they vote with their feet so
 
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
they tell us right that's one of the
 
01:24:22.930 --> 01:24:22.940 align:start position:0%
clearest ways we're we have to be
 
01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
creative we have to take risks we have
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
to see what the market needs what New
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs what trends are we need
 
01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
to be smart about what we do but then we
 
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
have to listen to students
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
we're also doing student-centered
 
01:24:38.209 --> 01:24:38.219 align:start position:0%
learning and everything we do so again
 
01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:41.219 align:start position:0%
in at a very large scale thinking of the
 
01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
programs we run but also how we teach
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
and what we do we try and we encourage
 
01:24:47.090 --> 01:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
our colleagues to be constantly looking
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
at what do students respond to what were
 
01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
the outcomes was it an effective
 
01:24:53.209 --> 01:24:53.219 align:start position:0%
approach to that if not change it and I
 
01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
think that kind of
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's constant Innovation there's an
 
01:24:59.209 --> 01:24:59.219 align:start position:0%
element of risk we're going to try stuff
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
and see if it works but that's the only
 
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
way we're going to make progress is
 
01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
there a downside to the university
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
system in terms of your revenues
 
01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:09.709 align:start position:0%
system in terms of your revenues
when

01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
we for example a Career Technical
 
01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
Education Centers where the directors
 
01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
are looking for skill in this technology
 
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
area and soft skills too in terms of how
 
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
to relate and communicate those
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
content areas that person possesses not
 
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
necessarily looking at a bachelor's
 
01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
degree so when we're going in that Trend
 
01:25:38.689 --> 01:25:38.699 align:start position:0%
possibly and probably realize how's that
 
01:25:40.130 --> 01:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
going to impact the university system
 
01:25:41.810 --> 01:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
are you going to have to change your
 
01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to have this 120
 
01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:45.070 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to have this 120
hours

01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:25:48.649 --> 01:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
so the 120 hours for the degree is not
 
01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
set by us it's set by the Department of
 
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
Education federally and that goes
 
01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
through our creditor that being said
 
01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:57.729 align:start position:0%
through our creditor that being said
between

01:25:57.729 --> 01:25:57.739 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
AP AP programs and others in high
 
01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
schools the First Start program that
 
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
runs through the Community College many
 
01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:06.260 align:start position:0%
students that come to us already have
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know 20 30 credits before they even
 
01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
arrive on campus so that's why it's
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
relatively easy for students to graduate
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
three years they're just not used
 
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
choosing to do that
 
01:26:19.370 --> 01:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
I think the
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
the more exciting piece is thinking
 
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
about how are students navigating
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
the micro credentialing space and that
 
01:26:30.649 --> 01:26:30.659 align:start position:0%
skill space I really appreciate the CTC
 
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
so in the fall I went up and visited the
 
01:26:36.290 --> 01:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
CTC at White Mountains High School I did
 
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
not remember the exact name White
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
Mountain House High School and they have
 
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
a wonderful manufacturing program and
 
01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
their students are coming out with
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
skills that can directly take them into
 
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
a manufacturing job or with a little
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
more training at the community college
 
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
can take them into that technical path
 
01:26:53.570 --> 01:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
but it also puts them on a road that
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
could take them into an engineering path
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
we have a gap between those two and so
 
01:27:01.729 --> 01:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
is it a is it a revenue challenge for us
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
no I think it's a revenue opportunity we
 
01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
should have our faculty and the
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
Community College faculty talking to the
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
ctcs about you don't have to get a
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
college degree you can go that other
 
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
path but you can if you want these are
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
options this part of that flexibility
 
01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
that students are looking for today and
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
if they know about it in high school
 
01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
then they can choose maybe they choose
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
to get a job right out of house high
 
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
school for a gap year and then they go
 
01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
to the Community College and get a
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
couple of a couple of years under their
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
belt there while they're working and
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
maybe get an associate's degree and know
 
01:27:33.709 --> 01:27:33.719 align:start position:0%
that oh a year later they could come
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
back and do a two-year degree and finish
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
up a bachelor's degree at Plymouth
 
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
um those are the conversations we have
 
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
to have more of but we can't afford to
 
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
stay in our silos where the CTC faculty
 
01:27:46.129 --> 01:27:46.139 align:start position:0%
don't talk to the Community College
 
01:27:47.209 --> 01:27:47.219 align:start position:0%
faculty and the Community College
 
01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
faculty don't talk to the University
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
faculty we have to build that bridge to
 
01:27:53.649 --> 01:27:53.659 align:start position:0%
make it work
 
01:27:56.209 --> 01:27:56.219 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you Mr
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you all for being
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
here as I mentioned earlier my niece is
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
a proud graduate of Plymouth State
 
01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
University and her brother went to UNH
 
01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:05.219 align:start position:0%
Manchester so great to see you all here
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
my question is this I know in the
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
beginning stages of
 
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
um college and the end of high school
 
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
there are merge years for example
 
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
running start and the like is there
 
01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
anything similar to that on the other
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
end for example you said somebody could
 
01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
have finished up in three years decided
 
01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
to stay for but could they somehow merge
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
their third and a half or fourth year
 
01:28:30.169 --> 01:28:30.179 align:start position:0%
with their first year of a graduate
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
program and go it that way and if so is
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
that beneficial to you and how thank you
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I absolutely 4-1 programs three two
 
01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
programs the idea that you can do your
 
01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree and your master's
 
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
degree at the same time is absolutely in
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
play across higher education including
 
01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
all of our campuses even more
 
01:28:54.649 --> 01:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
importantly I think it's another
 
01:28:56.930 --> 01:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to be able to build
 
01:28:59.689 --> 01:28:59.699 align:start position:0%
new Bridges because we have students
 
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
that want to go to Keene because they
 
01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
want to study
 
01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:04.490 align:start position:0%
want to study
um

01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
that any any maybe they want to study uh
 
01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
social work uh at King as an
 
01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
undergraduate but they want to get their
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
master's degree at UNH at the same time
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
I was trying to think of it through a
 
01:29:14.930 --> 01:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
great program that was unique to them
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
too but
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
um it turns out that
 
01:29:20.890 --> 01:29:20.900 align:start position:0%
that they can do right now we haven't
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
emphasized it and we haven't done the
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
hard work which we're trying to do now
 
01:29:25.850 --> 01:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
through the retreat we're doing tomorrow
 
01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
through the meetings we're doing with
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
the community colleges uh to try and
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
create more of those opportunities and
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
make them more public to the students so
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
that they know about them that's
 
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
something we have to do better yeah we
 
01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
do it on our campuses yeah well we've
 
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
been doing it for a long time it's
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
value-added for the students you save at
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
least a semester and sometimes even a
 
01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
Year's tuition and because some of the
 
01:29:48.770 --> 01:29:48.780 align:start position:0%
credits overlap from the two degrees so
 
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's a great value process but right now
 
01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
it's again to this so we are
 
01:29:56.209 --> 01:29:56.219 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out as many ways as we
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
can to give movement
 
01:30:01.850 --> 01:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
across our institutions that close these
 
01:30:05.689 --> 01:30:05.699 align:start position:0%
gaps representative oh you see what Mark
 
01:30:07.010 --> 01:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
do you want
 
01:30:09.770 --> 01:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
okay I was going to ask Mark the
 
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
question of how many of your students
 
01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:12.890 align:start position:0%
question of how many of your students
currently

01:30:12.890 --> 01:30:12.900 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
uh go on are in the program where they
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
matriculate uh automatically into one of
 
01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
the schools what percent that's sort of
 
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
getting into our discussion which is the
 
01:30:26.090 --> 01:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
next bullet where we're looking at the
 
01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
associates leading into the bachelor's
 
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
and but yes watch that's a good
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
would you turn on the mic please
 
01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
sorry in a typical recent year somewhere
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
between 600 and 700 students will
 
01:30:50.090 --> 01:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
transfer from the community college
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.530 --> 01:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
and today at at the time that they start
 
01:30:59.330 --> 01:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
there see if I may yes go ahead at the
 
01:31:01.370 --> 01:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
time that they start their program as a
 
01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
freshman do they
 
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
do they automatically get into that
 
01:31:09.649 --> 01:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
program I mean do they how do they let
 
01:31:11.810 --> 01:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
the institution know they want to
 
01:31:14.930 --> 01:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
matriculate into one of the other uh
 
01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:17.699 align:start position:0%
after they graduate or currently that's
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
an advising function for a student who
 
01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
enrolls in the community college system
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
to identify that as a destination
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
ideally we'd be able to build that into
 
01:31:28.490 --> 01:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
a platform that would allow a student to
 
01:31:30.649 --> 01:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
map degree programs between the two
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
systems that doesn't currently exist but
 
01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
we have articulation agreements and
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
pathway documents that describe for a
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
student that this series of courses
 
01:31:42.169 --> 01:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
leads to that series of courses allowing
 
01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
you to continue through to complete a
 
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree so when they if
 
01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
they're in that in that transition
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
period they're basically are taking what
 
01:31:55.129 --> 01:31:55.139 align:start position:0%
their their cognitive programs or the
 
01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
the basic programs so that when they
 
01:32:01.129 --> 01:32:01.139 align:start position:0%
matriculate into the uh of the four-year
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
institution they basically are focused
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
in on their major is that how that is
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
that how that works it's probably going
 
01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit more uh complex and
 
01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
interwoven than that for instance a
 
01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
student who is interested in a
 
01:32:15.649 --> 01:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree in accounting needs to
 
01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
be taking some accounting courses
 
01:32:19.490 --> 01:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
earlier than that a student who's
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
interested in the Health Sciences career
 
01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
biological science career is going to be
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
taking anatomy and physiology in the
 
01:32:28.129 --> 01:32:28.139 align:start position:0%
first two years so there are going to be
 
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
some prerequisite courses some courses
 
01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
that align with the major as well as
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
some general education courses
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh represent Ford has a
 
01:32:39.169 --> 01:32:39.179 align:start position:0%
question but I I'd like to just sort of
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
like transition in number five on our
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
agenda this is a report on the status of
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
the implementation of measures that we
 
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
put in effect in 1530 HP 1530
 
01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
establishing uh curricular transfer
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
Pathways between the community college
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire and the
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
university system New Hampshire ensuring
 
01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:58.149 align:start position:0%
university system New Hampshire ensuring
that

01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
I can remember president Burks coming in
 
01:33:03.649 --> 01:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
and saying that we're we're working
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
towards and anxious to accept uh our or
 
01:33:10.490 --> 01:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
have a good working relationship with
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
white Mountain Community College where
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
those two years
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
though that they take at that level will
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
come in and count towards and we had the
 
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
30 Pat 30 different Pathways and all
 
01:33:23.629 --> 01:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
that and maybe those credits count as
 
01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
gen Ed but I'd like to really walk back
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
into this and I think representative
 
01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
Ford has questions regarding this
 
01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
um and and Wayne I'd ask you to speak to
 
01:33:37.129 --> 01:33:37.139 align:start position:0%
that and also uh um Shannon and Mark
 
01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
this is also we're working here on the
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
same topic we got about a half hour left
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
it seemed to have been discussing
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
traditional students throughout this
 
01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
conversation here and I'm wondering if
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
we might also consider non-traditional
 
01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
students any kind of segues into the
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
other issue of transferring credits
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
community college credits and so forth
 
01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.090 align:start position:0%
community college credits and so forth
so

01:34:08.090 --> 01:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:10.010 --> 01:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
who would ever like to take off with it
 
01:34:12.610 --> 01:34:12.620 align:start position:0%
which are what's happening there sure um
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
Mark UK If I I'll take that and then
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
start and then let you continue so first
 
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
of all let's talk about non-traditional
 
01:34:24.490 --> 01:34:24.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
that I I think that universities in
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
general across the country have been way
 
01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
too focused on the 18 to 24 year old
 
01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
that is not a growth Market that is a
 
01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
that is a market that's probably going
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
to be steady but but but declining uh at
 
01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
UNH we've actually said that our growth
 
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
is going to be at The Graduate level and
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
and the non-traditional non-credit and
 
01:34:49.729 --> 01:34:49.739 align:start position:0%
micro credentialed Market that's where
 
01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
our growth is going to be don't look for
 
01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
UNH to be adding a lot more
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
undergraduates we're not going to we'd
 
01:34:56.209 --> 01:34:56.219 align:start position:0%
like to keep the number that we have
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
right now I'd like to mix it with more
 
01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
in-state students I'd like to increase
 
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
the the graduation rate which is already
 
01:35:04.729 --> 01:35:04.739 align:start position:0%
really really good but that'll be the
 
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
space that we're going to work in in the
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
micro credential space in the non-credit
 
01:35:10.729 --> 01:35:10.739 align:start position:0%
space in that non-traditional space and
 
01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
I will acknowledge that the GSC under uh
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
Chancellor rubinstein's leadership uh
 
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
already has a very strong Market there
 
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
with students that are average age over
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
30 I believe
 
01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.390 align:start position:0%
30 I believe
um

01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
but in addition we have over 20
 
01:35:29.209 --> 01:35:29.219 align:start position:0%
000 New Hampshire residents took part in
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
non-credit coursework at UNH last year
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
uh that number can't be overlooked
 
01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
that's having an enormous impact and it
 
01:35:38.689 --> 01:35:38.699 align:start position:0%
is generating Revenue that helps to
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
drive the university system so I think
 
01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
it's very very important
 
01:35:46.129 --> 01:35:46.139 align:start position:0%
coming back to HB 1530 and and touching
 
01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
base on that we very much appreciated
 
01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
the partnership and the and the
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
instigation of that uh as Chancellor
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
Rubenstein said we have many uh
 
01:35:59.689 --> 01:35:59.699 align:start position:0%
articulation agreements in fact we have
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
three usnh campuses and seven ccsnh
 
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
campuses so we have 21 articulation
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
agreements for every degree program
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
nearly uh so we have hundreds and
 
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
hundreds of them what we need to do and
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
what this house bill 1530 is going to
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
help us to do is to create some
 
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
signature Pathways that will work for
 
01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
all seven community colleges if possible
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
and all three system campuses
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
what we've done is we've set out to do
 
01:36:27.010 --> 01:36:27.020 align:start position:0%
that through a really good partnership
 
01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
uh Leslie um
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
Barber and Chancellor rubenstein's
 
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
office and Kate ziemer in my office are
 
01:36:36.169 --> 01:36:36.179 align:start position:0%
leading the charge working between the
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
two systems to look at all of the
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
different degree Pathways of the 600
 
01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
students that Chancellor Rubenstein
 
01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
referred to the vast majority of them
 
01:36:47.629 --> 01:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
cross over in 38 different degree
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
programs and we've now identified those
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
38 we've looked at where are their
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
unique combinations for example in the
 
01:36:55.850 --> 01:36:55.860 align:start position:0%
North country with Plymouth or between
 
01:36:58.450 --> 01:36:58.460 align:start position:0%
Great Bay community colleges and and UNH
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
some of them are unique but all of them
 
01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
if we can get the general education
 
01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
requirements lined up plus clear
 
01:37:10.129 --> 01:37:10.139 align:start position:0%
articulation of if you are in a major do
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
you need that accounting course or do
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
you need anatomy and physiology great
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
example Mark
 
01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
um and we're now trying to take that 38
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
we've identified the first 12 that we're
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
going to be working through uh and we
 
01:37:25.129 --> 01:37:25.139 align:start position:0%
hope to do that within the next year in
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
addition this bill kicked off a
 
01:37:29.330 --> 01:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
partnership that and I'll give
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
Chancellor Rubenstein credit that it was
 
01:37:33.229 --> 01:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
his idea that I reach out to Kristen
 
01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
Miller who's uh a vice president for
 
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
academic Affairs the kind of equivalent
 
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
of a Provost in the community colleges
 
01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:41.699 align:start position:0%
they meet every month all the Community
 
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
College uh provosts meet every month and
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
the system provosts you the usnh system
 
01:37:49.490 --> 01:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
Provost meet every month every other
 
01:37:51.169 --> 01:37:51.179 align:start position:0%
month we're now meeting together we're
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
meeting as a team to have conversations
 
01:37:55.729 --> 01:37:55.739 align:start position:0%
not just about 15 30 in fact for the
 
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
most part Leslie and Kate have been
 
01:37:59.209 --> 01:37:59.219 align:start position:0%
driving that but instead to talk about
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
how do we get faculty talking together
 
01:38:02.930 --> 01:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
how do we get make sure that the
 
01:38:05.090 --> 01:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
advising is is smooth and that we are
 
01:38:07.729 --> 01:38:07.739 align:start position:0%
communicating that these Pathways exist
 
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
so we're really quite excited
 
01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
um the 12 low-hanging fruit that have
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
been identified so far uh by Kate and
 
01:38:18.110 --> 01:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
Leslie and and their work uh include
 
01:38:20.330 --> 01:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
um business administration uh is big
 
01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
bambs uh across the two and education
 
01:38:25.370 --> 01:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
programs so those two are going to be
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
the tip of the spear nursing is actually
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
one of the largest degree programs and
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
probably has the most well-articulated
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
Pathways already uh that's on there
 
01:38:37.610 --> 01:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
um as well just to let you know and then
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
the last thing I'll say is working
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
together the the Provost and the vice
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
presidents for academic Affairs are
 
01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
planning to report to our boards what we
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
are doing so at the end of June uh the
 
01:38:52.850 --> 01:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
seven uh let's see the seven Community
 
01:38:54.850 --> 01:38:54.860 align:start position:0%
College Provost and the three Community
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
usnh Provost are all going to the usnh
 
01:39:00.110 --> 01:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
Border trustees meeting we're all going
 
01:39:01.729 --> 01:39:01.739 align:start position:0%
to be there for Kate and Leslie to
 
01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
present an update to those to that board
 
01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
on what we're doing and in July we're
 
01:39:07.010 --> 01:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing we're all going to
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
go to the community college board and
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're all going to present because it's
 
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
yes it's important to get the pathways
 
01:39:15.050 --> 01:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
created yes it's important that we have
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
these clear articulations for our
 
01:39:19.010 --> 01:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
students so that it's very clear what
 
01:39:21.290 --> 01:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
path they can go on and that they can
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
change after they matriculate but it's
 
01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
even more important that we'd be working
 
01:39:27.050 --> 01:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
together so our faculty are talking to
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
one another so our advisors are talking
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
together and and that I think is going
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
to be that secondary success that's
 
01:39:34.250 --> 01:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
going to make everything work
 
01:39:37.010 --> 01:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
Mark what would you add
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
if I can take a little license to also
 
01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
loop back to the previous question there
 
01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
just tie some things together
 
01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:46.510 align:start position:0%
just tie some things together
um

01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:49.490 --> 01:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
start with an early college then doing
 
01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment activity and the
 
01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
question about whether it should take
 
01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
four years although there are examples
 
01:39:56.570 --> 01:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
of students actually finishing the
 
01:39:58.970 --> 01:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
associate degree in the time that it
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
takes to complete High School the
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
typical student who's taking running
 
01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
start courses with us is taking one or
 
01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
two courses maybe taking some advanced
 
01:40:10.850 --> 01:40:10.860 align:start position:0%
placement courses as well but it's it's
 
01:40:13.729 --> 01:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
limited engagement at that point so From
 
01:40:15.169 --> 01:40:15.179 align:start position:0%
perspective of a student who would
 
01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
enroll at a four-year institution
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
whether it's Plymouth or or UNH or Keen
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
or whether it's
 
01:40:24.410 --> 01:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
heaven forbid Boston University as a
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
full-time student they may take 12 or 15
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
or 18 credits a semester the cost is no
 
01:40:31.490 --> 01:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
different and so that student can make
 
01:40:33.649 --> 01:40:33.659 align:start position:0%
up the one or two courses they've taken
 
01:40:35.689 --> 01:40:35.699 align:start position:0%
through early college and it sort of
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
disappears what we're hoping to do with
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
the investment that the state has
 
01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
proposed for expanding dual and
 
01:40:43.729 --> 01:40:43.739 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment and tying it to
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
1530 we'd actually like to build
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
structure to these Pathways so that a
 
01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
student can take a meaningful set of
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
courses a coherent set of courses so
 
01:40:55.129 --> 01:40:55.139 align:start position:0%
even beginning for students who are
 
01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
academically qualified as early as the
 
01:40:58.430 --> 01:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
sophomore year but certainly in the
 
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
Junior and Senior year a student would
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
have a semester or a year or more of
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
college as the foundation and we think
 
01:41:07.250 --> 01:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
it does two things one from an
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
affordability perspective that's a year
 
01:41:11.330 --> 01:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
less of tuition that they have to pay to
 
01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
any one of us but it's also a year
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
sooner to get to the labor market for
 
01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
students who have bad ambition to begin
 
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
to earn instead of paying into education
 
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
but the another thing we hope that we
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
can do in structuring this well
 
01:41:27.169 --> 01:41:27.179 align:start position:0%
we know that New Hampshire has a
 
01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
disproportionate share of college-bound
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
students going to four-year institutions
 
01:41:33.110 --> 01:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
out of state we think that if we can
 
01:41:35.450 --> 01:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
build these Pathways strongly enough we
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
can create an anchor that keeps more of
 
01:41:38.570 --> 01:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
those students in New Hampshire because
 
01:41:40.490 --> 01:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
they and their parents will see the
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
value proposition so part of what we're
 
01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
hoping to do is actually build structure
 
01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
not just the courses and the structure
 
01:41:49.250 --> 01:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
of the pathways but activities around
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
the students who are enrolled in these
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
courses bring them to our campuses help
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
them see the opportunity to stay in New
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so affordability the return on
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
the investment for New Hampshire for
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
those students and their families is
 
01:42:01.679 --> 01:42:03.189 align:start position:0%
those students and their families is
significant

01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that was asked
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
earlier but does this change the
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
economics of of the work we do and
 
01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
absolutely it does in a couple of ways
 
01:42:14.450 --> 01:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
between the two systems we'll no longer
 
01:42:16.609 --> 01:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
expect to see two years or four years of
 
01:42:18.410 --> 01:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
tuition from these students because
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
we'll have done more with the Early
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
College activities but one of the other
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
things the kinds of courses students are
 
01:42:26.209 --> 01:42:26.219 align:start position:0%
most likely to take while they're in
 
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
running start or early college tend to
 
01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
be general education liberal arts
 
01:42:33.649 --> 01:42:33.659 align:start position:0%
business type courses what's going to be
 
01:42:35.689 --> 01:42:35.699 align:start position:0%
left is an increasingly concentrated
 
01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
portfolio of classes in clinical classes
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
technical classes that are more
 
01:42:44.090 --> 01:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
expensive for us to offer without the
 
01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
ability to subsidize if you will with
 
01:42:47.930 --> 01:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
some of the larger enrolled general
 
01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
education type courses so it will
 
01:42:53.810 --> 01:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
increase the Reliance that we have on
 
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
the state to sustain affordability for
 
01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:57.659 align:start position:0%
the state to continue to make investment
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
in that work the other piece that came
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
up was the question about degrees versus
 
01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
alternative credentials
 
01:43:07.850 --> 01:43:07.860 align:start position:0%
again it's a different it's a different
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
way of thinking about the economics of
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
post-secondary Education two or four
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
years of tuition is a relatively steady
 
01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream from students micro
 
01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
credentials among those twenty thousand
 
01:43:21.649 --> 01:43:21.659 align:start position:0%
those could have been weekend classes
 
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
you know you know afternoon seminars or
 
01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
or something larger than that but the
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
revenue is not the same as credit
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
courses and right now the federal
 
01:43:33.169 --> 01:43:33.179 align:start position:0%
government doesn't treat them the same
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
so the availability of funding to
 
01:43:37.370 --> 01:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
support that is going to change the work
 
01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
whether a student rushes directly to
 
01:43:46.570 --> 01:43:46.580 align:start position:0%
finish a two or four year degree
 
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
maybe comes maybe becomes less important
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
I think it was governor of Pennsylvania
 
01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
who on his first day in office removed
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
the requirement of a bachelor's degree
 
01:43:59.090 --> 01:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
for employment in the state of
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania others have have done
 
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
similar things at a certain level that
 
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
degree becomes less important than the
 
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
education that supports it and the
 
01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
specialized knowledge you know whether
 
01:44:15.169 --> 01:44:15.179 align:start position:0%
it's in any particular technical field
 
01:44:18.169 --> 01:44:18.179 align:start position:0%
what we really have to do better K
 
01:44:20.689 --> 01:44:20.699 align:start position:0%
through 12 or pre-k through 12 we've got
 
01:44:23.570 --> 01:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
to Foster literacy and numeracy we've
 
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
got to strengthen students critical
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
thinking we've got to foster a passion
 
01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
for learning that doesn't get
 
01:44:31.129 --> 01:44:31.139 align:start position:0%
extinguished by what they experience
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
because ultimately what we teach them in
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
any class or in any program is going to
 
01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
have a limited shelf life what people
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
will need to learn 10 years now 20 years
 
01:44:43.609 --> 01:44:43.619 align:start position:0%
from now and the workforce is likely to
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
be different so we've got to rethink the
 
01:44:49.609 --> 01:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
way that our work as Educators it's not
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
the two years or four years after high
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
school even for those non-traditional
 
01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
students it is going to be a light it's
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
legitimately lifelong learning that
 
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
responds to changes in technology the
 
01:45:03.790 --> 01:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
economy people's lives and circumstances
 
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
one of the interesting data points in
 
01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employment economic
 
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
economic and labor market information
 
01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
Bureau 2030 projections for occupations
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
over 700 occupations listed the
 
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
projection is that the workforce will be
 
01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:22.010 align:start position:0%
projection is that the workforce will be
726

01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
726
 
01:45:23.930 --> 01:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
000 people employed here in New
 
01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:24.950 align:start position:0%
000 people employed here in New
Hampshire

01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:45:27.290 --> 01:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
and it's not evenly distributed you know
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
a thousand people in each of those 700
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
plus occupations 58 of those occupation
 
01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
no I shouldn't say 58 of the people
 
01:45:39.169 --> 01:45:39.179 align:start position:0%
expected to be employed will be in roles
 
01:45:42.609 --> 01:45:42.619 align:start position:0%
that don't require a specific degree
 
01:45:44.930 --> 01:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
not not graduate degree not
 
01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
undergraduate degree is going to require
 
01:45:50.330 --> 01:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
some type of learning that's unique to
 
01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
that responsibility to that role so
 
01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
again as much as we focus on certain
 
01:45:57.169 --> 01:45:57.179 align:start position:0%
occupations certain technical things and
 
01:45:58.970 --> 01:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
there's no shortage there's going to be
 
01:46:00.649 --> 01:46:00.659 align:start position:0%
a growth in a number of people who will
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
need bachelor's degrees or associate
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
degrees or doctoral degrees in certain
 
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
Fields but they will still represent
 
01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
less than half of the people working in
 
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
the state who will need some type of
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge that they get from either
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
on-the-job training or short-term
 
01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
training that prepares them to do what
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
they need to do next and we we've got to
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
be prepared to be responsive to those
 
01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:24.709 align:start position:0%
be prepared to be responsive to those
changes

01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm assuming thank you I'm assuming
 
01:46:31.970 --> 01:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
that this is you're referring in large
 
01:46:34.370 --> 01:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
part to the badges and that that whole
 
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh group of uh courses that may or may
 
01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
not be developed around the badging
 
01:46:42.169 --> 01:46:42.179 align:start position:0%
system that a lot of Industry seems to
 
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
be moving towards I I don't know that
 
01:46:47.209 --> 01:46:47.219 align:start position:0%
there'll be Badges and personal care
 
01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
assistant is going to be a steady demand
 
01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
as we age as a population no specific
 
01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
badge that I know although someone may
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
create one but it probably will require
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of knowledge
 
01:47:02.689 --> 01:47:02.699 align:start position:0%
understanding of of psychology or
 
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
behavior of of Health you know so again
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
you can turn it into a badge or a micro
 
01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
credential but people will need to know
 
01:47:12.169 --> 01:47:12.179 align:start position:0%
what they need to know yeah
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
I would I would add that employers are
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
parked in the same space the the demand
 
01:47:19.609 --> 01:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
for Badges and micro credentials is
 
01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
coming less from employers and more from
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
the individuals that are doing the work
 
01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:25.380 align:start position:0%
to pick up those skills uh when we
 
01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
partner through professional development
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
and training we partner with companies
 
01:47:31.010 --> 01:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
to deliver content to their employees
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
not to get a degree not to get credit
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
but to get the skill I the employers
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
want them to take it they don't care how
 
01:47:41.090 --> 01:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
it gets curated
 
01:47:42.649 --> 01:47:42.659 align:start position:0%
um so I think that that's going to be
 
01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
something that the market is going to
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
figure out over time but it's coming
 
01:47:48.410 --> 01:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
from the people doing the work to take
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
those additional trainings so they can
 
01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
put it on their resume in a manner that
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
they have for Mark because also
 
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
applicable I think to the four-year
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
system uh are if I take a course at
 
01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
White Mountain
 
01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
is that going to be
 
01:48:11.330 --> 01:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
recede by another Community College one
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
of the other six colleges or are they
 
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
going to in their own Department say
 
01:48:16.729 --> 01:48:16.739 align:start position:0%
that doesn't measure up to what we have
 
01:48:18.830 --> 01:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
as the criteria for that course how's
 
01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
this working the same type of issue for
 
01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
four year two that's exactly the work
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
that we've been undertaking to have
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
faculty across disciplines across our
 
01:48:31.129 --> 01:48:31.139 align:start position:0%
system take a look at the curriculum we
 
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
offer in order to ensure that students
 
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
don't run into barriers that they will
 
01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
know that this course is applicable at
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
other campuses across the system soon
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
virtually anything you would anticipate
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
comes in as a transfer course but we're
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
working to make it more seamless than
 
01:48:50.209 --> 01:48:50.219 align:start position:0%
that historically we've had a hard time
 
01:48:53.090 --> 01:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
just between keen and Plymouth yeah much
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
less the community college system and
 
01:48:57.770 --> 01:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
this is it there's no reason for it at
 
01:49:00.169 --> 01:49:00.179 align:start position:0%
all it's completely unnecessary it's
 
01:49:02.209 --> 01:49:02.219 align:start position:0%
built on the culture of you know where
 
01:49:03.709 --> 01:49:03.719 align:start position:0%
people are and what they're used to and
 
01:49:05.810 --> 01:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
their sense of we know what's best for
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
our students and I appreciate that and I
 
01:49:09.770 --> 01:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
value what you know their expertise but
 
01:49:11.810 --> 01:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
I that that is an impediment to what our
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
students need so we are now working
 
01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
across usnh but also with ccsnh
 
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
precisely so this stuff is clear and
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
unambiguous and so Nate if I'm applying
 
01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
to UNH and I I've got the application
 
01:49:28.010 --> 01:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
where if UNH feels or the university
 
01:49:30.050 --> 01:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
system says it might be a good candidate
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
for Keen or a Plymouth but you're not
 
01:49:36.109 --> 01:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
going to make it into UNH so I go to una
 
01:49:38.810 --> 01:49:38.820 align:start position:0%
to Plymouth or to Keen I take a course
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
or two and decide I really want to move
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
back into UNH where I first want to go
 
01:49:47.090 --> 01:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
are those courses that I now took at
 
01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
Plymouth or Keene going to transfer to
 
01:49:52.330 --> 01:49:52.340 align:start position:0%
you Wayne at the
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
historically the answer would have been
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
it's not up to Wayne it's not up to me
 
01:49:58.129 --> 01:49:58.139 align:start position:0%
it's up to the faculty in whatever
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
Department it was to make that decision
 
01:50:02.270 --> 01:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
and that is not the way no I'm telling
 
01:50:04.490 --> 01:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
you the truth and that is not acceptable
 
01:50:07.370 --> 01:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
and so what we really need to do is say
 
01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
we and now we are in a place and we want
 
01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
to be in a place across the state in
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
higher education to say absolutely no
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
question when are we going to get there
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
we're on the way so in some places we're
 
01:50:22.310 --> 01:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
already there the question is how do we
 
01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
do that more broadly
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
yeah that's I I wouldn't want you to
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
come away thinking we're not there
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
because we are in in many disciplines uh
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
particularly in the professional
 
01:50:33.770 --> 01:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
disciplines in The Sciences in
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
engineering programs in uh in business
 
01:50:38.450 --> 01:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
those transfer really really well where
 
01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
we have some of our biggest problems is
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
actually in the liberal arts and the
 
01:50:44.090 --> 01:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
humanities and we have to get those
 
01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
faculty to communicate with one another
 
01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
we don't have this isolationist tendency
 
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
that has existed in higher education for
 
01:50:54.890 --> 01:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
decades uh that is really the barrier
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
we're pushing against so do you have a
 
01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:57.430 align:start position:0%
we're pushing against so do you have a
comment

01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
Walter Peterson and I worked on
 
01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
articulation agreements for years
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
we thought we had the problem solved
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
obviously the problem The Beat Goes On
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
but let me just say the hours that we
 
01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:12.530 align:start position:0%
but let me just say the hours that we
spent

01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
spent
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
on that situation talking to kids who
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't get their credits transferred
 
01:51:21.890 --> 01:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
they you know it was
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
it was a terrible problem that it it it
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's really that's something that should
 
01:51:30.970 --> 01:51:30.980 align:start position:0%
have been taken care of years years ago
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh we you're all accredited
 
01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
you go through an accreditation process
 
01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
that cost you a ton of money
 
01:51:40.850 --> 01:51:40.860 align:start position:0%
right everybody gets the stamp of
 
01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
approval used to be from the New England
 
01:51:46.629 --> 01:51:46.639 align:start position:0%
board now it's but itchy
 
01:51:48.770 --> 01:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
I went through it when I was president
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
of a college it's a real pain of the
 
01:51:54.649 --> 01:51:54.659 align:start position:0%
neck but you all get it and it seems to
 
01:51:59.209 --> 01:51:59.219 align:start position:0%
be why is it that the standard if they
 
01:52:00.890 --> 01:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
get it why aren't the credits
 
01:52:03.890 --> 01:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
transferable and it's it's been a
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
problem forever uh and it's really gonna
 
01:52:09.770 --> 01:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
be it's got to be solved if it makes you
 
01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
feel any better you were successful the
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
credits all transfer are great that the
 
01:52:16.490 --> 01:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
credits transfer right into specific
 
01:52:18.290 --> 01:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
challenges and this is true Community
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
College to usnh as well as between us
 
01:52:24.050 --> 01:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
and H institutions is for some of the
 
01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
majors and for some of those some of
 
01:52:32.150 --> 01:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:37.270 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:39.649 --> 01:52:39.659 align:start position:0%
credits transfer what we'll work on now
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
actually is to have grades transfer as
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
well we want this to be seamless to the
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
point that a student can take the
 
01:52:48.050 --> 01:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
courses they need where they need them
 
01:52:49.850 --> 01:52:49.860 align:start position:0%
and part of this and it goes back to the
 
01:52:53.649 --> 01:52:53.659 align:start position:0%
non-traditional question and the 1530
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
right now we have students and across
 
01:53:00.169 --> 01:53:00.179 align:start position:0%
our system roughly 25 percent of our
 
01:53:01.490 --> 01:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
instruction is occurring online
 
01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
primarily through asynchronous online
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
instruction particularly for
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
non-traditional students who are
 
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
location bound the ability to take
 
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
advantage of a course that's offered at
 
01:53:13.970 --> 01:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
another campus or being offered in the
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
semester they need it in the format that
 
01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
they need it shouldn't be a barrier to
 
01:53:20.689 --> 01:53:20.699 align:start position:0%
that student making progress so again
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make full use of what's
 
01:53:26.930 --> 01:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
in 1530 not just thinking in terms of
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
two plus two but the language in that
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
bill is optimizing the utility and
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
affordability of the campuses and for
 
01:53:33.950 --> 01:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
our non-traditional students who are
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
location bound both within the system
 
01:53:38.209 --> 01:53:38.219 align:start position:0%
and between the two systems trying to
 
01:53:40.129 --> 01:53:40.139 align:start position:0%
find ways to make full use of that
 
01:53:44.109 --> 01:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:46.669 --> 01:53:46.679 align:start position:0%
this has been very instructive I
 
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate your talking about this and
 
01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
you talk about the multiple ways you're
 
01:53:55.250 --> 01:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
serving students
 
01:53:59.209 --> 01:53:59.219 align:start position:0%
but students equal economics
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
to each Institution
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
so with this multiple options
 
01:54:11.149 --> 01:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
of um the My the micro certifications uh
 
01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
going in going out competition between
 
01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:17.330 align:start position:0%
going in going out competition between
schools

01:54:17.330 --> 01:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:20.209 --> 01:54:20.219 align:start position:0%
between let's say do I go to Plymouth do
 
01:54:23.209 --> 01:54:23.219 align:start position:0%
I go to Keene do I go to UNH
 
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
it all boils down to some economics I
 
01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
mean you've got your budget you've got
 
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
to deal with
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
so with the multiple approaches
 
01:54:35.209 --> 01:54:35.219 align:start position:0%
of students gaining their education or
 
01:54:37.010 --> 01:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
professional development opportunities
 
01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
with business
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:45.229 --> 01:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
I think ultimately
 
01:54:48.169 --> 01:54:48.179 align:start position:0%
we can't each of us is a distinct
 
01:54:51.290 --> 01:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
institution with a distinct Mission and
 
01:54:54.169 --> 01:54:54.179 align:start position:0%
the strengths but we each of us cannot
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
be everything to every student and
 
01:54:58.250 --> 01:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
that's not responsible that's not smart
 
01:55:00.410 --> 01:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
it's not good for any of us so what
 
01:55:02.030 --> 01:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
we're really committed to doing and one
 
01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
of the reasons we're working as closely
 
01:55:05.209 --> 01:55:05.219 align:start position:0%
together with the Arts okay so what do
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
we do really well at Plymouth what do
 
01:55:09.649 --> 01:55:09.659 align:start position:0%
our students need how do we Define our
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
mission and articulate what we do really
 
01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
well make sure we're not stepping on
 
01:55:16.129 --> 01:55:16.139 align:start position:0%
anyone else's toes let them do I'm not
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to compete with an R1 that's that
 
01:55:19.310 --> 01:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense for me it's not
 
01:55:21.649 --> 01:55:21.659 align:start position:0%
going to serve my students well so Wayne
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
and I are going to work together to make
 
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
sure we understand our spaces and our
 
01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
students and how we serve them and
 
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
ultimately that's not I mean not every
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
student belongs at Plymouth State and
 
01:55:33.229 --> 01:55:33.239 align:start position:0%
not every student belongs at UNH and
 
01:55:34.669 --> 01:55:34.679 align:start position:0%
that's the work that we need to do
 
01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
together not every student needs to be
 
01:55:38.689 --> 01:55:38.699 align:start position:0%
in a four-year degree and that's why we
 
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
have to be talking to each other but the
 
01:55:43.729 --> 01:55:43.739 align:start position:0%
Kings music program can compete with UNH
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
oh yes and so somehow we've got
 
01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
you know we've got to get this thing
 
01:55:53.149 --> 01:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
well squared away here we have just
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
folded our Bachelor's in music degree
 
01:55:59.090 --> 01:55:59.100 align:start position:0%
because we cannot compete with Keen and
 
01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
we don't want to so we have a music Ed
 
01:56:03.530 --> 01:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
degree that's very well used and highly
 
01:56:04.970 --> 01:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
productive and we leverage it it's
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
important for the North Country we don't
 
01:56:08.689 --> 01:56:08.699 align:start position:0%
need a bachelor of musical arts degree
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
at Plymouth State and we've closed it
 
01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:11.870 align:start position:0%
at Plymouth State and we've closed it
down

01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:56:13.729 --> 01:56:13.739 align:start position:0%
it's worth sharing
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
so first of all I can't say thank you
 
01:56:16.850 --> 01:56:16.860 align:start position:0%
enough for the partnership that we have
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
between the presidents the three
 
01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
presidents at the three U.S NH
 
01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
institutions and the Provost at the
 
01:56:23.330 --> 01:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
three U.S Nation institutions are all
 
01:56:25.729 --> 01:56:25.739 align:start position:0%
communicating constantly now and we're
 
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
making decisions collectively and we're
 
01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
changing policies collectively to try
 
01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
and make that a tighter integration that
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
was a great example Nate but it happens
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
at UNH as well I mean our athletic
 
01:56:38.689 --> 01:56:38.699 align:start position:0%
training program at UNH I shut down
 
01:56:41.450 --> 01:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
because it was higher rated at Plymouth
 
01:56:43.609 --> 01:56:43.619 align:start position:0%
and so I'm going to shut it down I'm
 
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
going to partner with Plymouth because
 
01:56:46.010 --> 01:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
we still have some students that want to
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
do that but they can do that in
 
01:56:49.490 --> 01:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
partnership with a with a Plymouth
 
01:56:52.850 --> 01:56:52.860 align:start position:0%
degree but we we have to go further than
 
01:56:54.590 --> 01:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
that as we work together we have to take
 
01:56:56.090 --> 01:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
a look at admissions because students
 
01:56:58.970 --> 01:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
don't know that we need to be totally
 
01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable with and we have been
 
01:57:03.050 --> 01:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
students that apply to UNH and don't get
 
01:57:04.850 --> 01:57:04.860 align:start position:0%
in are immediately made available to
 
01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
Keenan Plymouth we have a wait list as
 
01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
soon as we release the wait list we
 
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
release the waitlist to Keene and
 
01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
Plymouth we have partnership that says
 
01:57:14.089 --> 01:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
that you know for example at this time
 
01:57:15.669 --> 01:57:15.679 align:start position:0%
of year what's going on right now
 
01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
particularly this year in higher
 
01:57:20.930 --> 01:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
education is hand-to-hand combat for
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
students that are either undecided or on
 
01:57:25.729 --> 01:57:25.739 align:start position:0%
on somebody else's wait lists so we're
 
01:57:28.609 --> 01:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
having more institutions so for example
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
the six New England flagships every one
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
of them went to their wait list this
 
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
year and their wait list is populated by
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
students at other so we're we're
 
01:57:39.290 --> 01:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
literally fighting over individual
 
01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
students but Keen Plymouth and UNH made
 
01:57:43.970 --> 01:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
the Strategic decision to share our
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
lists so if I have someone that we're
 
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
going after that I know has already said
 
01:57:51.229 --> 01:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
yes to Plymouth I'm not going after them
 
01:57:53.629 --> 01:57:53.639 align:start position:0%
they're off limits and I think those
 
01:57:55.129 --> 01:57:55.139 align:start position:0%
types of Partnerships those types of
 
01:57:57.229 --> 01:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
policies and then the coordination of
 
01:57:59.810 --> 01:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
our curriculum is what we need to do in
 
01:58:02.270 --> 01:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
a state the size of New Hampshire in a
 
01:58:05.810 --> 01:58:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative Ford
 
01:58:10.189 --> 01:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and that sounds very
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
encouraging to hear that
 
01:58:15.229 --> 01:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
one concern that bothers me in
 
01:58:16.970 --> 01:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
particular and I don't like to get into
 
01:58:19.310 --> 01:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
specific nitty-gritty but this is
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
General enough
 
01:58:24.109 --> 01:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
a student presented a credential from
 
01:58:28.129 --> 01:58:28.139 align:start position:0%
one another University and was asked for
 
01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
the in addition to the credential itself
 
01:58:34.990 --> 01:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
the curriculum of this course they took
 
01:58:41.209 --> 01:58:41.219 align:start position:0%
to ascertain whether or not the
 
01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
objectives of the course they were
 
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
trying to transfer match the objectives
 
01:58:49.609 --> 01:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
at another institution which is not part
 
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
of what I have always understood
 
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
accreditation to be about
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
well this is unfortunately and you're
 
01:58:58.609 --> 01:58:58.619 align:start position:0%
absolutely right this is what I was
 
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
referring to earlier that we have to and
 
01:59:04.609 --> 01:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
and we are moving past historically the
 
01:59:06.589 --> 01:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
control of what is taught is in control
 
01:59:08.689 --> 01:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
of the faculty the substance and what
 
01:59:10.609 --> 01:59:10.619 align:start position:0%
you're referring to is the syllabus of
 
01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
the course has to be approved by the
 
01:59:16.370 --> 01:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
department accepting the students now I
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
agree that is not the right way to be
 
01:59:20.570 --> 01:59:20.580 align:start position:0%
doing it but historically and this is
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
tied to accreditation because the
 
01:59:24.890 --> 01:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
ultimate academic decisions are made by
 
01:59:26.689 --> 01:59:26.699 align:start position:0%
the faculty and the faculty on the
 
01:59:28.970 --> 01:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
program so this is this is a complicated
 
01:59:31.310 --> 01:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
this is tied to a creditor so they we
 
01:59:34.070 --> 01:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
are accredited but it's complex so we're
 
01:59:36.290 --> 01:59:36.300 align:start position:0%
working on this and we've made lots and
 
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
lots of progress to avoid exactly that
 
01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:40.390 align:start position:0%
lots of progress to avoid exactly that
circumstance

01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
accreditation might be at risk well
 
01:59:45.649 --> 01:59:45.659 align:start position:0%
there's it depends on what you're
 
01:59:47.149 --> 01:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
talking about as accreditation so
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's there's University accreditation
 
01:59:51.770 --> 01:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
which is neche and then there's degree
 
01:59:54.169 --> 01:59:54.179 align:start position:0%
accreditation so not knowing the details
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
of this specific regular case if the
 
01:59:58.970 --> 01:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
degree if a course is transferring in
 
02:00:01.490 --> 02:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
from I'll pick on abet which is the
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
engineering accreditor we are accredited
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
by abet if it's coming in from an abet
 
02:00:08.330 --> 02:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
accredited institution it should
 
02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:09.589 align:start position:0%
accredited institution it should
transfer

02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
02:00:12.290 --> 02:00:12.300 align:start position:0%
however the same course might be taught
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
at a non-abet accredited institution and
 
02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
therefore they would need to to maintain
 
02:00:20.589 --> 02:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
our abet certification look at the
 
02:00:23.629 --> 02:00:23.639 align:start position:0%
syllabus what brought a particular twist
 
02:00:26.209 --> 02:00:26.219 align:start position:0%
to the individual I'm talking about was
 
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
the course had been taken 11 years ago
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
that's a good well we're really uh at
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
the time for closing this meeting down
 
02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank you very much all of
 
02:00:49.310 --> 02:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
you coming in from community college
 
02:00:51.890 --> 02:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
system in the University system is it
 
02:00:54.290 --> 02:00:54.300 align:start position:0%
possible that those reports which you're
 
02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
going to be issuing to the trustees at
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
the end of June and on in July a copy of
 
02:01:02.570 --> 02:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
that report could be issued to this
 
02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
committee so we could share it with all
 
02:01:05.709 --> 02:01:05.719 align:start position:0%
members on on the committee here
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely so that the what's going to
 
02:01:10.669 --> 02:01:10.679 align:start position:0%
be shared with the boards of Trustees I
