thank you there we go I'm going to start
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
over um now we are broadcasting on on
 
00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:23.959 align:start position:0%
YouTube so this is the subcommittee uh
 
00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:25.509 align:start position:0%
YouTube so this is the subcommittee uh
hearing

00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
for House Bill
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
225 uh the the title of the bill is
 
00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
relative to prohibiting the use of
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
currency that could be detrimental to
 
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
privacy rights this bill was introduced
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
last year by representative beler and it
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
was held over uh the summer and and then
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
this year sent to interim study and this
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
is the interim study work session on the
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh the committee felt the bill was
 
00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:53.959 align:start position:0%
not ready for prime time and the sponsor
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
agreed with us and sent
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
us some uh written testim
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
he says this is representative Mike
 
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
Belcher regarding the necessity of for
 
00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:05.959 align:start position:0%
such a bill as this I believe it become
 
00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:07.639 align:start position:0%
more and more clear that it is in fact
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
wholly necessary to make measures to
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire residents from the
 
00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
burgeoning digital control mechanisms
 
00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
that threaten freedom and liberty
 
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
however many legitimate issues have been
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
raised regarding the exact wording of
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
this bill I would request that the
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
committee consider taking whatever
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
action deemed most appropriate to
 
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
promote the study of the issue for the
 
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
development of better language such that
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
another better Bill might be might come
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
forward in the next session so those are
 
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.430 align:start position:0%
forward in the next session so those are
his

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
comments and so we're going to do
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
something a little bit different uh we

cbdc and the future of money the term
 
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
Central Bank digital currency or cbdc
 
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
has quickly shifted from an academic
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
idea to an economic reality according to
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
the human rights Foundation cbdc tracker
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
over 1.5 billion ion people currently
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
live in countries where cbdcs have been
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
rolled out yet many people still have no
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
idea what a cbdc is let alone whether
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
their government is pursuing one it's
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
for this reason that I'm grateful for
 
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify here today so
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
first what is a cbdc in short it's a
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
digital National currency that is a
 
00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:53.759 align:start position:0%
direct liability of a country Central
 
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:56.759 align:start position:0%
Bank typically discussions of cbdcs
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
revolve around the retail model where
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
cbdc is designed for consumers to use in
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
day-to-day purchases at first glance
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
this description might sound
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
uncontroversial considering most of us
 
00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:11.959 align:start position:0%
make some form of digital payment every
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
day what is different with a cbdc
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
however is that it's it's the government
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
would ultimately be the one processing
 
00:14:20.079 --> 00:14:20.990 align:start position:0%
would ultimately be the one processing
those

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
transactions so rather than have
 
00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:25.759 align:start position:0%
transactions spread across banks credit
 
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
unions and the like Financial
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
transactions would be centralized in the
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
hands of the federal government and it's
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
for this reason the creation of a US
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
cbdc would pose a fundamental threat to
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
financial privacy likely the greatest
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
since the enactment of the bank secrecy
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
Act and the establishment of the third
 
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
party Doctrine with so much information
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
in hand a cbdc would enable the
 
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
government to restrict Financial Freedom
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
in countless
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
ways unfortunately the observations in
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
practice have given us little to be
 
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
hopeful about if I were to summarize the
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
international experience thus far it
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
would boil down to two
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
categories a restriction on the lives of
 
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
citizens and a waste of taxpayer
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
resources for example in Nigeria the
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
government caused a cash shortage in
 
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
hopes of spurring adoption when only
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
0.5% of the population was using its
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
cbdc in the Bahamas the government will
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
soon Force Banks to distribute its cbdc
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
and most recently in Thailand the
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
government launched a quasi cbdc through
 
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
a digital wallet that restricts payments
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
to government approved Goods at
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
government approved stores within the
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
district listed on each person's ID
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
card these restrictions are also taking
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
place in subtler ways as documented in

and more have all said the goal is to go
 
00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
cashless and that cbdcs are the way they
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
will get
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
there but what about the question of
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
whether cbdcs are an appropriate use of
 
00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:12.629 align:start position:0%
whether cbdcs are an appropriate use of
taxpayer

00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
resources again from the international
 
00:16:16.749 --> 00:16:16.759 align:start position:0%
experience we see that governments that
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
have launched cbdcs are struggling to
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
get anyone to use them on a day-to-day
 
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
basis the public generally recognizes
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
that their needs are being met by
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
existing options like Mobile Banking pay
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
payment apps and
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
cash so in the best case it's a waste of
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayer resources because it does not
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
offer any unique benefits that are not
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
already being provided for by the market
 
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
in the worst case cbdcs could threaten
 
00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
Financial privacy freedom and markets at
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
large issues that have already begun to
 
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
surface with these concerns in mind what
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
role is there though at the state
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
level it's a difficult question members
 
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
of Congress have the authority to limit
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve so it doesn't move
 
00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
forward but options are limited at the
 
00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:08.919 align:start position:0%
state level there are really three
 
00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:11.079 align:start position:0%
legislative approaches that officials
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
have taken or considered thus far the
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
first option is to prohibit the use of
 
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.710 align:start position:0%
first option is to prohibit the use of
cbdcs

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
cbdcs
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
entirely given concerns on the table
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
it's understandable why this option
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
might appear
 
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
appealing however it poses significant
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
concerns a imagine if a constituent went
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
to the Bahamas on vacation and came home
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
with some of the Bohemian cbdc left over
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
how would enforcement work would the
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
state establish a surveillance Network
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
to monitor travel would the citizen be
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
searched Upon returning to the state
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this path can quickly
 
00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
devolve into its own assault on
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
financial privacy and
 
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
Freedom the second option lies in what
 
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
many states have done over the past few
 
00:17:59.950 --> 00:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
years namely classify CBD s within State
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
Statute so they are excluded from the
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
definition of money in the Uniform
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
Commercial Code or
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
UCC unfortunately these options also
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
have extended
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
consequences a person or business may
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
still use a cbdc under this approach
 
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
it's just that they are not afforded the
 
00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
legal protections one might typically
 
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
expect Under the UCC so again it's
 
00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:24.919 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the citizens that stand to
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
lose a third option is to explicitly
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
prohibits State agencies from using a
 
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
cbdc or participating in cbdc programs
 
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
we the first option is too hot and the
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
second option is perhaps too cold this
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
third option might be just right it does
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
not restrict the freedoms of individual
 
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
citizens but it does limit the hands of
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
government now unfortunately all three
 
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
options appear vulnerable to the
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
supremacy clause in fact Florida
 
00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
Governor Ronda santis acknowledge that
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
his bill would likely be overridden if
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
Congress chose to move forward but it
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
should be said that the 10th Amendment
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
Center has argued that the supremacy
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
clause is not so black and white in
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
practice the same argument came up when
 
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
States initially began to legalize
 
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis and the experience with the
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing delay of real ID implementation
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
shows that states are if nothing else
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
able to establish roadblocks that slow
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
down the process
 
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
with that in mind there's a fourth
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
option on the table that should also be
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
considered all three legislative
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
approaches have in common that they send
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
a message they show that states are
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
watching and they will not silently fall
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
into line however there are other ways
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
to do this too State officials are in a
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
unique position to bridge the gap
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
between citizens and the larger
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
government raising awareness and making
 
00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
sure concerns are being heard by members
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
of Congress is crucial that can be done
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
through town halls op-eds letters and
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
even meetings such as this one these
 
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
Avenues should not be
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
underestimated in closing the committee
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
is correct to keep an eye on the rise of
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
cbdcs and what options are on the table
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
I I thank CH uh Vice chair Amon and
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak on this issue and I
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
welcome any questions you may have large
 
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh for your
 
00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chairman thanks
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
Nick for your testimony I appreciate it
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
um so if I understand you correctly the
 
00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.950 align:start position:0%
um so if I understand you correctly the
KO

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
KO
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
Institute recommendation would be
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
passing similar legislation to some of
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
the other states or recommending that
 
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire consider
 
00:20:59.500 --> 00:20:59.510 align:start position:0%
legislation that limit limits New
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:00.590 align:start position:0%
legislation that limit limits New
[Music]

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:06.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's participation or ability to
 
00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
accept digital
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
currency as a more means of
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
tender uh essentially
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
to message the federal
 
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
government that we do not approve of
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
not Nick were you able to hear
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
question uh look like it okay see what's
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
going on here by the stunned silence uh
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
there you are maybe not I I had we had a
 
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
little feedback earlier I turned the
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
microphone off okay so we were talking
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
to you Nick and you able to hear us so
 
00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll let representative MCU repeat
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
the question hi hi it's representative
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
Tim MCU um so I'm
 
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
just gonna sort of paraphrase then is it
 
00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:15.799 align:start position:0%
the KO institute's suggestion that we
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
can that New Hampshire consider
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
legislation that would perhaps limit the
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
states of New Hampshire's ability to
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
accept digital currency as a means of
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
payment for any sort of of payment to
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
the state as a means to essentially send
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
a message to the United States federal
 
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
government that we don't approve of uh
 
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
this this sort of invasive
 
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.390 align:start position:0%
this this sort of invasive
privacy

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:45.400 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh type of currency like like like the
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
way you've described it being
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
implemented in other
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
countries so I have to be very careful
 
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
uh in that the KO Institute can't
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
endorse any legislation
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
but what I can say is that if states are
 
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
to take a legislative approach I think
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
that's the best option on the table is
 
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it's saying that the
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
state agencies are not going to require
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
this as payment or Force citizens to use
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
it and they're not going to participate
 
00:23:20.269 --> 00:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
in these programs that make sure that
 
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
you're not having any sweeping
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
restrictions on the citizens and also
 
00:23:27.549 --> 00:23:27.559 align:start position:0%
you're still managing to send that
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
message and ultimately have the federal
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
government have to say something if they
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
want to push forward with this then they
 
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
have to acknowledge why all these states
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
had a problem with it and why they're
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
anyway well thank you yes I guess I
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
follow up um but the but your your
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
position is pretty clear that it's a
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's an invasive means of tracking
 
00:23:59.950 --> 00:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures tracking individual
 
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.310 align:start position:0%
expenditures tracking individual
movements

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
movements
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
expenses U all sorts of things that the
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
the federal government could use for
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
countless other
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
things I mean every bit of somebody's
 
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.190 align:start position:0%
things I mean every bit of somebody's
personal

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
life and and that's
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
the potentially orwellian future if the
 
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
Central Bank digital currency comes to
 
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
pass and that's potentially why
 
00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
North Carolina and several other states
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
have decided that this isn't the right
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
way to right way for their state to go I
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
mean am I am I understanding that
 
00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
correctly I mean what I what I've read
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
and and heard from your testimony and
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
others and and the research from other
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
states it's it's why it's really not the
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way and it's not in line
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
with our constitutionally protected
 
00:24:53.549 --> 00:24:53.559 align:start position:0%
right to privacy right in New Hampshire
 
00:24:56.669 --> 00:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
yeah you you are correct that is why so
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
many people are concerned about this and
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
why so many people have been speaking
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
out just really year after year and it's
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
why I spend a lot of my time working
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
here in DC with Congress to try to put
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
serious restrictions on the Federal
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
Reserve and the department of the
 
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
treasury to say they cannot go ahead and
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
do this of their own accord because it
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
represents a
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
fundamental uh a front to really the
 
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution at large very specifically
 
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
the the Fourth Amendment quite obviously
 
00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
but really it gets into a whole Hornet's
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
Nest of problems and again to your point
 
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
that is why so many states are looking
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
at this and saying wait no this is not
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
something that we want to
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
have you question I I do so we so we
 
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
passed set of Bill 255 it was a privacy
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
act I was one of the sponsors it was one
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
of the first bills to get signed this
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
year I mean isn't this kind of a
 
00:25:59.950 --> 00:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
followup I mean isn't this one of the
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
things that that we couldn't we didn't
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
pass it this by any of them but
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it be one of our legislative
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
priorities to to look at other things
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
that we can do to proactively protect
 
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
the privacy of our citizens I mean isn't
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
that what we're seeing happen across the
 
00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
country yes I I really could not agree
 
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
more that this is something that should
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
be a focus and the timing is really
 
00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
quite brilliant because across the
 
00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
country American are noticing that this
 
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
financial privacy that they thought they
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
had and even this General sense of
 
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
privacy that they thought they had is
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
really an illusion of privacy it's been
 
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
something that's been chipped away at
 
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
for decades and now people are noticing
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
more than ever before and so it really
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
is good to get ahead of this and not
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
wait for the next catastrophe whether
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
that be a cbdc a a data leak or what
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
have you it's it's better to get ahead
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
of these problems and try to fix them
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
before they become problems that are
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
affecting people's day-to-day lives yeah
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
I mean it fright just editorializing it
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
frightens me now we we you talk about
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
something in your in your living room
 
00:27:15.389 --> 00:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
and you know she is listening right the
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
you know Alexa Siri one of them is
 
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
listening and then the next thing you
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
know you're in your car and you get an
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
ad for whatever you just talking about I
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
mean that's creepy
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
enough yeah represent have a question
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
do thank you and thank you Mr Anthony um
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
for coming in in a somewhat unusual
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
manner um but I appreciate it um I have
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
a couple of questions one very specific
 
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
and the other very general uh the first
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
specific one is you mentioned that some
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
countries are have actually decided to
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
use a uh Central Bank digital
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
currency uh and what I am wondering
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
is while such a decision may have been
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
made is anybody in that in that country
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
for instance in the Bahamas uh actually
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
using such a currency and more
 
00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
specifically if I were to go to the
 
00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:15.559 align:start position:0%
Bahamas and go to a bank to exchange my
 
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
dollars for the local currency would I
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
get the local currency as I normally
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
would in a foreign country or would I
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
get some kind of a digital
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
currency thank you those are such good
 
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.070 align:start position:0%
currency thank you those are such good
questions

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh on the first one uh unfortunately uh
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
despite the countless amount of money
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's being spent on these projects
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
they are not going to good use people
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
are not using the Central Bank digital
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
currencies where they've been launched
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
so one example is in
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
Nigeria this is the largest population
 
00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:54.670 align:start position:0%
in Africa if I'm not mistaken only
 
00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.029 align:start position:0%
in Africa if I'm not mistaken only
[Music]

00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
0.5% of the population started using the
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
cbdc we're seeing that same experience
 
00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the Bahamas very few people
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
are using it and that's why the
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
government is going to soon Force the
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
banks to distribute it to try to make
 
00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:14.679 align:start position:0%
people use it even in China we've seen
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
examples of people saying they get for
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up question uh on the specific
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
on a specific issue
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
um if I went to the
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
and got that digital wallet that you
 
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:31.909 align:start position:0%
and got that digital wallet that you
were

00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
describing um and I then went to a
 
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
souvenir shop to buy a souvenir could I
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
actually pay for it with that digital
 
00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:46.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
it of a tricky answer it's a coin flip
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
so to speak uh one of the big problems
 
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
that they've been having in the Bahamas
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
specifically is to get any Merchant to
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
on board with this nobody wants to have
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
a brand new payments terminal on their
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
desk so they refuse to use it and so you
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
might find some shops that use it but
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
the vast majority do not use it and this
 
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
cbdc has been out there for I I believe
 
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
four years now and it's still just such
 
00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:22.519 align:start position:0%
a tossup if you have any opportunity to
 
00:31:22.519 --> 00:31:23.350 align:start position:0%
a tossup if you have any opportunity to
use

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
it um oh sorry uh second follow-up
 
00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:29.029 align:start position:0%
it um oh sorry uh second follow-up
question

00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
um so doesn't that seem to get rid of
 
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
the problem that somebody could come
 
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
back from the Bahamas and have some of
 
00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:40.039 align:start position:0%
these uh cbdcs left over because if
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're not using it you're not going to
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
get it and you're not going to have any
 
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
left over it seemed that problem would
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
exist of a a silver a silver lining when
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
we consider any of the risks whether in
 
00:31:59.789 --> 00:31:59.799 align:start position:0%
this case coming back to the states or
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
with the the financial privacy freedom
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
and Market concerns that are there is
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
that if nobody uses them then there
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
really isn't those problems coming into
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
practice they they luckily were remain
 
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799 align:start position:0%
in the theoretical
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
realm um I'm not surprised do you have
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
another question I do may I ask it yeah
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
we have uh we're 20 minutes in so we
 
00:32:26.629 --> 00:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
want to keep conscious of time um okay
 
00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
I'll try and be as quick as I can than
 
00:32:28.519 --> 00:32:29.629 align:start position:0%
I'll try and be as quick as I can than
you

00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh okay the general question has to do
 
00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
with the fact that um my bank knows a
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
great deal about me you mentioned that
 
00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:39.799 align:start position:0%
this would be the government processing
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
transactions instead of banks my bank
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
knows a great deal about me but I don't
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
trust them with any information that I
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
don't have to because historically banks
 
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
are not that reliable um so I don't give
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
them any information I don't have to now
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
I have had to give them a lot of
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
information but I try and keep it to the
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
minimum uh the federal government on the
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
other hand already knows everything
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
about me because I used to work for the
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
federal government and I had to get what
 
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
was very like a security clearance it in
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
fact used the same form as a security
 
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
clearance I got investigated the federal
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
government knows everything about me um
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
and that was part of my job um
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
and the bottom line for me was that I
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
trusted the federal government more than
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
I trusted the bank uh based on the
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
historical record so I guess my general
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
question for you is why do you trust the
 
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
bank more than you trust the federal
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
government oh gosh there's a lot of
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
angles that I could go with this with
 
00:33:44.669 --> 00:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
but the main what I want to focus
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
because our time's limited is I much
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
rather have my information at one place
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
here and they have only what they need
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
just like you described only what they
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
need and I have someone else with only
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
what they need so that if any one of
 
00:34:03.149 --> 00:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
those is compromised whether it's a hack
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's a employee mishap or
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
something else at least not everything
 
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.190 align:start position:0%
something else at least not everything
is

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
taken when it comes to having everything
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
in the hands of the federal government
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
I'm very glad to hear that you have had
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
a positive experience but I very much
 
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
worry that if we talk about having every
 
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
American's information in a central
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
database that's not only going to
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
present a target for like four profit
 
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
hackers that might be targeting the
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
banks but unfortunately that's also
 
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
going to inspire this country's enemies
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
who are going to do it as an act of
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
warfare as well and not think about it
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
in the same economic calculation of is
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
it worth it to go after this it's just
 
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
going to be we're trying to completely
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
undermine the system and it presents a
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately unprecedented Target in
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
what it would have and it's a little
 
00:34:59.790 --> 00:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
rare that that uh somebody like myself
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
speaking from the the KO Institute a
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
Libertarian Think Tank will have room
 
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
for agreement with officials from the
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve but this is even
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
something that the Federal Reserve has
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
come out and said we are deeply
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about and it's something that
 
00:35:17.069 --> 00:35:17.079 align:start position:0%
we don't know how to
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
you Nick um so sou North Carolina just
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
passed house 690 and they did it they
 
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
even overrode the governor's veto with a
 
00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.829 align:start position:0%
even overrode the governor's veto with a
bipartisan

00:35:34.829 --> 00:35:34.839 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
 
00:35:34.839 --> 00:35:37.190 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
override

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
override
 
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
thank House Bill 690 in uh North
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
Carolina they overrode the governor's
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
veto in a bipartisan way Democrats and
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
Republicans came together to pass this
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
fairly simple bill it has a definition
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
of Central Bank digital currency and
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
then it just says that state agencies
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
and it has a list uh basically shall not
 
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
uh be involved with the testing or using
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
a central bank dig what why do you think
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
they did that uh first part of the
 
00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
question and if you could project from
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
short term out to long term what is what
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
do you think is your projection as the
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
the risk of a central bank digital
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
currency being imposed on us at some
 
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
point in the future maybe during a
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
financial crisis or some other
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
event so I think uh specifically on the
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
the state level I think one benefit to
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
take out of there is that if we have
 
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
States speaking out and saying that they
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
are not going to be involved in this
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
project they're not going to require it
 
00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:43.510 align:start position:0%
project they're not going to require it
force

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
it basically a a signal a kind of
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
I will say It's seems to be more of an
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
if question now a few years ago it felt
 
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
like a when most people were talking
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
about it as an
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
inevitable but what you flagged is so
 
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
important because it used to be that it
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
was inevitable that'll happen no matter
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
what good times or bad times now it
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
feels like an if question for at least
 
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
the good times but if there's a crisis
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
heaven forbid another pandemic a war a
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
recession or or what have you we have
 
00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
seen that the federal government will
 
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
mobilize quickly and specifically the
 
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve and the department of
 
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
the treasury will mobilize quickly both
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
were considering in cbdc during the
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic and it was really only by the
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
speed of what was happening uh
 
00:37:59.550 --> 00:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
interrupting plans so it's very likely
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
that one could be rolled out if a
 
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
sufficient crisis were to rise granted
 
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
again I just want to emphasize that
 
00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
becomes harder and harder with the more
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
people that are speaking out because
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
those concerns have to be addressed if
 
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
it is to
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
happen all right any any further
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
questions any further
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
time Nick and uh you broke
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
believe it or not in the 21st century
 
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
that's great super so thank you very
 
00:38:33.069 --> 00:38:33.079 align:start position:0%
much and you're welcome to stick around
 
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
or or drop off I know you have a flight
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
to catch but we we'll continue the
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
conversation here thank you so much and
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions please feel
 
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
free to reach out to me anytime I'm
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
always happy to lend it very good all

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
you all right uh I think
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
we I I I appreciated having someone
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
who's been thinking about this for years
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
great you want to try your own
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
off uh okay I think uh the master switch
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
there never mind
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
this just leave it so we can everybody
 
00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.910 align:start position:0%
this just leave it so we can everybody
can

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
talk there you go yeah okay uh I I
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
appreciated the remote testimony uh we
 
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
might have had a few hiccups for the
 
00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
YouTube stream but we'll get it worked
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
out next time um any any thoughts on uh
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
how to proceed with our subcommittee
 
00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation I think it's just
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
representative M and myself yeah so
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I think it's um so
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
if I understand correctly
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
our only motion to make is to recommend
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
further legislation I mean when we exec
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
the bill I mean we will have an
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
executive session and we'll recommend as
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
a full
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
committee yeah we we'll recommend as a
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
full committee that someone should file
 
00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.430 align:start position:0%
full committee that someone should file
another

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
LSR or or not yeah and that really is a
 
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.589 align:start position:0%
LSR or or not yeah and that really is a
bit

00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
non-binding it is very
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
non-binding I would say that that the
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
current bill 225 is not recommended for
 
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
future legislation and mainly because
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
the definitions aren't very well defined
 
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
right um and then maybe somewhere in the
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
blurb we mentioned that uh I mean this
 
00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:44.839 align:start position:0%
bill would be a lot closer to something
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
that I think might get pasted the the
 
00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
North Carolina the North Carolina and
 
00:40:51.069 --> 00:40:51.079 align:start position:0%
that's just the latest version so maybe
 
00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
maybe something else will come out
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
between now and filing day but re
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
recommend 225 not for future legislation
 
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
with the caveat yeah put it in the blur
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
in the blur we can recommend just
 
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
pointing to this other bill that exists
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
and that's it's at least a better
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
defined bill yeah subject matter- wise I
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
mean it's important we consider for the
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
reasons I mentioned um I mean it's a
 
00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty high priority that we do
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
what we do in New Hampshire which is get
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
ahead of the game on these types of
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
issues I mean it's it's important that
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
we do that that clearly wasn't the right
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
vehicle it's not the right language
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
there's some other better language out
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
there but this committee does it very
 
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
well when it comes to considering those
 
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
types of issues ahead of parts of the
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
rest of the country and and we should
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
continue to do that I think so too
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
um there's talk in the full committee
 
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
about prophylactic legislation haha
 
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
prophylactic um but to me you want to
 
00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
put barriers between incos on our
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
citizens rights so if there's a
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
potential incos on a right it's good to
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
have a barrier there that needs to be
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
penetrated before the rights are
 
00:42:07.309 --> 00:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
infringed upon right so that proactive
 
00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
right it's it's some sure but we want to
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
do that selectively and carefully so
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I agree all right so I'll make a
 
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
motion uh not the subcommittee will
 
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
recommend not for future recommendation
 
00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
with the caveat uh just at least making
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
people aware of uh the South the North
 
00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
Carolina Bill and and any other simil
 
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
bills that have passed recent second
 
00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:32.839 align:start position:0%
okay all right all in favor I think it's
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
just me and you Tim oh well there we go
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
I okay two to nothing anyos no two to
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
nothing it's amazing what you can
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
do take five before we start yeah you
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
want to take five yeah I go to bathroom
 
00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:56.119 align:start position:0%

open the subcommittee hearing on House
 
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.950 align:start position:0%
open the subcommittee hearing on House
Bill

00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
1674 so this bill uh I'll just give a
 
00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
little history on this bill um a former
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
state senator uh Jim fory asked me to
 
00:51:58.990 --> 00:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
put this bill in and I worked with him
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh over about a year ago we worked
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
together to put this bill in uh and you
 
00:52:08.109 --> 00:52:08.119 align:start position:0%
know we had public hearings on it it was
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
probably too big of a bite at the Apple
 
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
because it contained three different
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
sections it was make uh have the state
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
declare gold and silver as legal tender
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
which several other states have
 
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:24.799 align:start position:0%
done um the second one was the state
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
treasurer would set up a Boolean deposit
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
depository and at least Texas has done
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
that already so gold bullion depository
 
00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:33.640 align:start position:0%
and the third thing which was a little
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
bit of a stretch was issue digital
 
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
tokens as receipts for the bullion those
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
digital tokens could be redeemable and
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
exchangeable and there are gold back
 
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
digital tokens in the marketplace but
 
00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
just not backed up by a sovereign state
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
so nobody's done that yet um and uh in
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
talk in talking with Senator fora
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh who has since passed away
 
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately he died in a wind surfing
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
accident and and has passed but uh in
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
talking to him his concern is
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
about uh the fact that uh the you know
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
the the federal monetary policy seems to
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
be going off the
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
rails um and just like some current
 
00:53:23.789 --> 00:53:23.799 align:start position:0%
stats the you know the the national debt
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
is 34 plus trillion
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh over 200,000 per
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayer the largest budget item in the
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
federal budget even higher than National
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
Defense is the interest on the debt it's
 
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
over a trillion dollars and our deficit
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
spending is almost $2 trillion a year so
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
the government is spending $2 trillion
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
more than it takes in every year and
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
that seems to be accelerating and so the
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
the thought is that um because the go
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
the federal government has the ability
 
00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
to print new money they can debase the
 
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
currency and that debases the value that
 
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
they owe that that 34 trillion plus
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
dollars they can pay it back in in
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
dollars that are worth less in the
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
future and that seems to be the
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
direction that it's going in how do we
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
protect our citizens from that uh
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
process Senator foresight was a big
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
sound money guy and we know in the state
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
con or in the Federal Constitution it's
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
an article 10 it talks about gold and
 
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
silver being
 
00:54:32.789 --> 00:54:32.799 align:start position:0%
money um you know that's a very old so
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
here here it is I have it on the screen
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
there any make
 
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
anything so that it says the powers
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
denied to the states they can do the
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
they cannot do these things and they
 
00:54:45.309 --> 00:54:45.319 align:start position:0%
they cannot make anything but gold and
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
silver a tender and payment in debts and
 
00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
so that's the key phrase that other
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
states have picked up on
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
um our committee researcher Kristen has
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
kindly uh given us a list um this is as
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
recent as February so this might have
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
might have changed since
 
00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
but but there are um I'll list a couple
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
of the states that have uh some legal
 
00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
tender laws on the books Arizona Indiana
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
Kansas City um Kansas sorry Louisiana
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
Missouri Oklahoma South Carolina
 
00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
Tennessee Texas Utah and West Virginia
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
all have some uh some exemption that
 
00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:29.039 align:start position:0%
take gold and silver and give it the
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
status of legal
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
tender one of the things you notice when
 
00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
you look through this is that a lot of
 
00:55:37.029 --> 00:55:37.039 align:start position:0%
it has to do with exempting from sales
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
and income taxes and so our our state
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a sales or income tax but
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
we do have business taxes so there might
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
be some application for businesses to
 
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
transact in gold and silver I think the
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
demand is probably very low at the
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
current time um so anyway that's a gist
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
of the original House Bill 16
 
00:56:01.549 --> 00:56:01.559 align:start position:0%
74 what I did uh at our last session
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
right before our executive session I
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
just carved out the legal tender portion
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
of it so I I Whitted it way back took
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
out the Boolean depository and took out
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
the digital
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
tokens um those are ideas before their
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
time in my opinion um and just made it
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
to the legal tender aspect so maybe we
 
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
can just limit our discussion to the
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
legal tender piece of it and that's uh
 
00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:29.029 align:start position:0%
legal tender piece of it and that's uh
house

00:56:29.029 --> 00:56:29.039 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:56:29.039 --> 00:56:31.109 align:start position:0%
house
Amendment

00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:56:31.119 --> 00:56:32.710 align:start position:0%
Amendment
2024-25

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
2024-25
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
3H that's the amendment that I'm talking
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
about if you need a copy I have some
 
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.190 align:start position:0%
about if you need a copy I have some
copies

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
copies
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
here you want to take a minute to read
 
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
it over and this this was sort of mimic
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
um I think there's some concerns about
 
00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.150 align:start position:0%
um I think there's some concerns about
uh

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh accepting gold and
 
00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
silver and so so the intention would be
 
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
to not mandate this but make it uh make
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
it you know enabling but I don't know
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association do you want to
 
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
have anything to add I know you've
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
weighed in
 
00:57:15.789 --> 00:57:15.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
up and I'll just when I put this bill in
 
00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
in November
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
2023 gold was at $1,900 an ounce and
 
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
yesterday it was
 
00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
2670 20 so it's 40%
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
more but um the way to think about it is
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
the value of the dollar has gone down
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
the purchasing power of that gold stays
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
roughly the same so that's a really
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
difficult thing for the American mind to
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
comprehend because we're not used to
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
dealing in different currencies uh maybe
 
00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
the old before the EU was established
 
00:57:52.589 --> 00:57:52.599 align:start position:0%
you would think about uh you know
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
exchange rates between countries but um
 
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's just a a little piece
 
00:57:59.029 --> 00:57:59.039 align:start position:0%
of tribute would you like to introduce
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
yourself sure thank you so much um
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative aan my name is Katherine
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
hack I represent the 234 cities and
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
towns in New Hampshire at the municipal
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
Association and we did have some
 
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
conversations and some testimony um
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
around the original Bill and some
 
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
concerns we had about municipalities
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
being mandated and working with the
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
sponsors um we discussed having it be
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation because as a
 
00:58:27.069 --> 00:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
representative Aman just pointed out it
 
00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
would be like trading in foreign
 
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
currency on a regular basis and
 
00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities especially our smallest
 
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
communities are not set up to trade um
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
and any type of currency on a daily
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
basis and check prices um and these are
 
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
tax dollars that we're working with so
 
00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:46.599 align:start position:0%
if the price went down one day and we
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
happened to trade because we needed to
 
00:58:50.349 --> 00:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
make payroll because we were even in
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
under enabling we could potentially be
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
losing tax dollars in the trade um of
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
in the exchange of funds right so we
 
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
also if it's physical silver and gold
 
00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
you know the physical Metals um maybe
 
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
Palladium Platinum whatever it happens
 
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
to be we don't have facilities to store
 
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
them safely and we are required already
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
by law to bring $1,500 or more to the
 
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
bank on a daily basis that's already in
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
state law so if you can imagine an you
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
know a small piece of gold that you know
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
right a gold coin essentially an ounce
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
we would and the only place to go would
 
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
be to conquer to the treasurer so then
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
we would have be paying employees
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
mileage and time so for for
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities it it it might be a
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
challenge um under any type of mandated
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
system for for us to operate safely
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
effectively and efficiently and of
 
00:59:47.549 --> 00:59:47.559 align:start position:0%
course preserving the principle of the
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
tax dollar because there's also costs
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
for trading and spot and there's all
 
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
sorts of other logistics as far as a
 
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
digital currency
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
um that would have to be much more
 
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
understood and socialized for
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities to understand um what
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.069 --> 01:00:11.079 align:start position:0%
platform thank you thank you very much
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
any anything anything you'd like to say
 
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.870 align:start position:0%
any anything anything you'd like to say
representative

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
Gibbs okay go
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair um and thank
 
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
you for coming in um I guess my question
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
is is fairly General um
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
are the cities in town set up to act as
 
01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
gold exchanges and calculate the price
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
uh since taxes are are calculated in
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
dollars calculate the worth of if
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
somebody brought in gold coins to pay
 
01:00:45.029 --> 01:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
taxes are they set up to calculate the
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
worth um and what would they have to do
 
01:00:50.109 --> 01:00:50.119 align:start position:0%
to be set up that
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
way so thank you for your question um
 
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question no we are
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
we are not set up that way and we
 
01:00:59.309 --> 01:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
are to to purchase silver and gold right
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
now you'd have to go to a silver and
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
gold dealer in addition we don't report
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
um other than payroll taxes to the IRS
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
and anytime you trade in more than
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
$10,000 in in Precious Metals you do
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
have to do reporting to the IRS so those
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
would be also additional pieces but
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
essentially someone could come in at
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
9:00 in the morning and pay something in
 
01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
silver and gold or ask for their
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
paycheck in silver and gold depending
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
whether it's an employer or a taxation
 
01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:29.720 align:start position:0%
and gold could be trading at
 
01:01:32.349 --> 01:01:32.359 align:start position:0%
$2,641 and by the end of the day it
 
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
could be higher or lower and of
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
course we're we're decoupled from the US
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
dollar and we do business based on the
 
01:01:44.829 --> 01:01:44.839 align:start position:0%
the value of the US dollar not based on
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
another um commodity so because it's a
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
commodity right now it's in the
 
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
Commodities market so again there would
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
have to be a lot of Education and
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
Training for a municipality to take that
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
on and the preservation
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
of your tax dollar maintainance value of
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
course is first and foremost on our
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
minds uh and a comment as a followup
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
sure this is this is freefor all you can
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm uh I I actually am familiar
 
01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
with using different currencies most
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
Americans I agree probably aren't but
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
when I was young I traveled through uh a
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
lot of small countries one after another
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
after another over a period of a few
 
01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
weeks and was constantly
 
01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
uh working from one currency to another
 
01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
and what we dealt with were currency
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
exchanges uh that were set up to
 
01:02:37.269 --> 01:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
calculate the value of those currencies
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
one against another or one against the
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
dollar however that that particular one
 
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
worked um so I'm aware of how complex
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing actually is and
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
considering that gold is traded as a
 
01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
commodity which uh well at that time the
 
01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
uh Yugoslav uh um it may have been the
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
darar I wouldn't swear to it um whatever
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
the Yugoslav currency was when
 
01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
Yugoslavia existed um it it wasn't being
 
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
traded as a commodity in the same way
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
that gold is so I I could see how that
 
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
could be a lot more
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
complicated all right very good thank
 
01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
you for Testimony um thank you so I'm
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
GNA make a recommendation for a motion
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
and a and a report so see if I can get
 
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
this out of my so we're going to
 
01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
recommend that this particular bill is
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
not recommended for future legislation
 
01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:35.240 align:start position:0%
but um we may want to consider this
 
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
amendment for future legislation or at
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
least studying it for future legislation
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
and what I I guess what I would like to
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
have a better understanding of we just
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
heard okay let me just finish my thought
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
here we just heard that municipalities
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
might not be able to manage it we do
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
have other states that have done this
 
01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
and they even have uh sales and income
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
taxes that they have to deal with so
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to delve a little more
 
01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
into how these other states are handling
 
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
the concerns that you just raised before
 
01:04:08.269 --> 01:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
we craft legislation and we would just
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
narrow it down to the legal tender piece
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
as like a stepping stone as like a
 
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
potential First Step but making sure
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
that the municipalities aren't burdened
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
by you know some some unforeseen thing
 
01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
so recommendation recommendation would
 
01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:26.039 align:start position:0%
be not for a f future recommendation the
 
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
committee report I'm going to mention
 
01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.990 align:start position:0%
committee report I'm going to mention
studying

01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
studying
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
existing uh states that have similar and
 
01:04:35.549 --> 01:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
and then referencing this amendment so
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
at least people can find the amendment
 
01:04:40.029 --> 01:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
which is the smaller version of the
 
01:04:40.039 --> 01:04:40.910 align:start position:0%
which is the smaller version of the
original

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
bill you want to you want to add to that
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I just have a
 
01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
question and it was actually for the
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
municipal Association
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
um well for both of you don't if memory
 
01:04:58.589 --> 01:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
serves we have a requirement I thought
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
in statute already maybe our committee
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
researcher knows um or somebody here
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
probably already knows don't we have a
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
requirement that municipalities have to
 
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
take cash for for payment of certain
 
01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
things or was it enabling was that
 
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
enabling I thought we passed that at one
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
point does anybody
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
remember you do know I don't you don't
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
know the city of conquer does take cash
 
01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
I know this because I once had to pay my
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
property taxes in cash it was a long
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
story and I won't bore you but the city
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
of conquer took cash for property tax
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
yes we are required to take legal tender
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay so the followup the followup Part B
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
is then um the H how many gold coins and
 
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
it's more than one how many gold coins
 
01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
are legal tender I mean certainly the
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
American Eagle is legal tender and it's
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
a gold coin um and it's worth more than
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
50 bucks which is what's marked on the
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
so in that case we can take it at its
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
face value so if it's a $5 coin because
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
it's our exchange at the bank or or 500
 
01:06:09.069 --> 01:06:09.079 align:start position:0%
whatever the face value of the coin is
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
is how we currently have to do business
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
so for the person handing you that they
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
would be losing a significant amount of
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
money MH right because I have a gold
 
01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
coin in a necklace so if I use that as
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
cash I would only get its face value
 
01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
because I have to go to a Chartered bank
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
or a federally Chartered Bank authorized
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
by the state of New Hampshire to do
 
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
business and it's whatever they will
 
01:06:34.349 --> 01:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
give me for that coin which is its face
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
value right now then what do you do with
 
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
this 1 o $50 face value gold coin that's
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
worth spot value
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
$2,670 at today's spot
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
price well which which of the which of
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
the which what what applies that
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
$1,500 got to run it to the bank or the
 
01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.630 align:start position:0%
$1,500 got to run it to the bank or the
spot

01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
spot
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
price the the face value in this case
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
would apply okay so you drop it until
 
01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
like a $50 bill right but in this bill
 
01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
originally as as the sponsor crafted it
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities would have been required
 
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
to take silver and gold as legal tender
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
right and that would include the the
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
commodity value not the face value of
 
01:07:20.109 --> 01:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
the coin and that's where the difference
 
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
comes in right because a $2 gold coin is
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
a is just $2 to us I'm guessing it
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen all that often that
 
01:07:30.029 --> 01:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
somebody I I would hope that people know
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
what they have in their hand for value
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
and would not the coin doesn't make it
 
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
all the way to the bank
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
right so we I I have not heard of that
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
in my role they stop at a pawn shoping
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
all right it's possible sure sure all
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
right so that's a valid concern so and
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh anyhow
 
01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
so let's uh we'll we'll talk about that
 
01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
other states have done this and that we
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
should study what their their approach
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
was more before um uh offering something
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
similar to this amendment or something
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
based off of it as a starting point
 
01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
something like that yeah well we should
 
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
at least offer legislation that I mean
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
legal tender is legal tender people
 
01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
should be able to pay with whatever
 
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
legal tender they want to pay pay with
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like we already can and I
 
01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
think sorry I think I we would want to
 
01:08:17.149 --> 01:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
find out in addition to whether they've
 
01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
actually enacted it which you know I
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
understand substates have whether
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
whether anybody is actually doing it
 
01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
whether anybody is walking in to city
 
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
tax office with gold coins to pay their
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
property taxes whether that's actually
 
01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.470 align:start position:0%
property taxes whether that's actually
happened

01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
yeah probably
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
rarely um but it is very uh you
 
01:08:43.149 --> 01:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned the face value of the coins
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
and just think about the disconnect
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
between how what that actual face value
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
used to be and the value of the metal
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's in the coin it's drastically
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
there's a big uh it kind of illustrates
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
how how the dollar is going down in
 
01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
value each individual unit so anyway we
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
won't beat that horse to death anymore
 
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
so I'll make a motion to uh I'll just
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
restate what I was going to write in the
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
committee report subcommittee report not
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation for
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
1674 we need to study other states that
 
01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
have passed legal tender or species
 
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
legal tender as specic bills uh and we
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
have a list of them and then if we're
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
going to move forward potentially
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
amendment 2 2024
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
d373 as a starting point uh and and
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
implementing anything we find in
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
researching these other states second
 
01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
all right hopefully I said that
 
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
correctly but you did all right all in
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
favor say I I any opposed all right two
 
01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
to zero and and we're done thank you
 
01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:54.310 align:start position:0%
to zero and and we're done thank you
very

01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
