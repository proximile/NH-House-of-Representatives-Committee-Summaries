as he already knows while this isn't a
 
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
redo of the hearing uh there may be a
 
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
technical question or two and with the
 
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
leave of the chair we could ask him to
 
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
give us a sentence or two answer the
 
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
bill requires the court to schedule a
 
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
final disposition hearing upon the
 
00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 align:start position:0%
issuance of temporary orders in a
 
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
divorce proceeding who would like to
 
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
McMahon thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
relative to the uh statement here when I
 
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
was reading into this when was the uh
 
00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
when a a final disposition hearing would
 
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
take place because when when you read
 
00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
into the
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
methodology there's a timeline of a
 
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
competing interests on what would be uh
 
00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
provided for supporting the issues in
 
00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
play and then how much time that would
 
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
actually take to meet whenever this
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
hearing would would happen and that
 
00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 align:start position:0%
that's I was wonder what my question on
 
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
this is is there is is there a inherent
 
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
timeline before uh temporary orders are
 
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
issued so that the the contested issues
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
addressed before a final uh dis
 
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
disposition hearing would happen and
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's was this was getting
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat complicated and then the cost
 
00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
of um the no cost identified but it's
 
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
referenced it's saying what's it take
 
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
for multiple hearings then when there's
 
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
competing interests here to meet a
 
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
deadline that they one or the or both
 
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
meet so that's why I have I have a a
 
00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
real I'm I'm not in support of what this
 
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
is offering because the information is
 
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
not complete on what the total impact
 
00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
would be on our court system and the
 
00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate process for adjudication of
 
00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh the competing interests
 
00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:01.350 align:start position:0%
uh the competing interests
thank

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
folks all right so I um in looking at
 
00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 align:start position:0%
this I understand and I appreciate the
 
00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 align:start position:0%
sponsor for being here today that's
 
00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 align:start position:0%
super helpful I understand the idea of
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
wanting to have these because divorces
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
can be lengthy and you know it seems to
 
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
solve an issue by saying okay we
 
00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
automatically have a date
 
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
however I disagree with just the idea of
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
having you know to schedule a date
 
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
immediately um first of all you can have
 
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
cases that should last I mean let's just
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
look at that if people come into a queue
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
and everybody automatically gets a date
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
you might have somebody come in that
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
maybe their divorce is very amicable it
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
should only take 30 days but because of
 
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
all these dates scheduled theirs is now
 
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
going to take 3 years so the pressure
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
that this would put on the court reports
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
and even saying you know we have a date
 
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
but it can change some of those changes
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
if you have to have a set date you could
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
you don't change until like the day
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
before we did have the courts in here
 
00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:13.879 align:start position:0%
and they specified how complicated that
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
would be so while I think this is
 
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.230 align:start position:0%
would be so while I think this is
looking

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
looking
 
00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:20.919 align:start position:0%
to um solve a little problem it's going
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
to cause a much much bigger problem in a
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
much much bigger bottleneck for our
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
courts so I would be opposed to this
 
00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:30.189 align:start position:0%
courts so I would be opposed to this
bill

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:30.990 align:start position:0%
bill
thank

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
you representative ball this is informal
 
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
we kind of KN okay thank you chairman
 
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
paron for nodding to me
 
00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
yes um I remember when we spoke that
 
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800 align:start position:0%
about this bill um in committee and my
 
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
concern was that it's taking way too
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
long to get the final disposition dates
 
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
when people are ready to move forward
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
and that people were just looking to be
 
00:07:59.309 --> 00:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
put in the queue so that they would
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
would not be working on being amicable
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
and coming up with um their parenting
 
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
plans and doing all the things that they
 
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
need to do to work together and then say
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
okay we need our final date and find out
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to get scheduled a year
 
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
out that just opens the door for more
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
animosity and more frustration and
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
people want to get on with their lives
 
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
and I I think that if we schedule a date
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
or the court schedules a date there's
 
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
nothing to say that that date can't then
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
be said we don't need the date or we
 
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to push it out to an
 
00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
unforeseen and then you have no date but
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
for those um cases where it's moving
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
along everything is amicable everybody
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
knows um how things are going to end
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
they do need to have a date they need to
 
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
know when
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
um when they're going to be able to move
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
on with their life and how they can
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
schedule um
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.910 align:start position:0%
 
divorce

00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
divorce
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
I representative long thank you Mr
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um so yeah I I have I have the
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
same issues with uh I I look at this as
 
00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
a creating more conflict now that
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
there's a competing interest uh there's
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
a date that they have to meet I could
 
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
blame I could blame the other party for
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
not meeting that date um and as far as
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
pushing it
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
out I I'm thinking when I read this I'm
 
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
thinking that I could push out the date
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
but I have to give another
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
date um I just can't push it out
 
00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
indefinitely I I have to give a d a
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
final disposition so it was going to be
 
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
in September we see that's not going to
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
happen uh do I put it in
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
December uh do I put it in January so so
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh pushing it out
 
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.870 align:start position:0%
uh pushing it out
is

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
every every case needs a final uh
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
disposition so I I I'm over the opinion
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
that this will
 
00:10:04.829 --> 00:10:04.839 align:start position:0%
create uh more of a conflict it opens
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
the door for more of a conflict so I'm
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
is as I think we've been learning
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
um especially those of us who have also
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
been working on the special committee on
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
the court each case has its own issues
 
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
and we may not know how it's going to
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
end um for some time
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
similarly there are
 
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
emergencies and they take precedence and
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
if you had the emergency you would want
 
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
it to so the date is set and we're now
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
at that date and there's three or four
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
emergency orders that have to be written
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
and hearings that have to be done and at
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
the end of the day we haven't gotten to
 
00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
this so now it has to go out further uh
 
00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
one one of the things that we have
 
00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:03.079 align:start position:0%
learned in terms of
 
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
calendar is until recent well no even
 
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
now we don't have enough
 
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
judges and the report there was a
 
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.110 align:start position:0%
judges and the report there was a
wonderful

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
report that looked at cases based on the
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
average amount of time in the past they
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
would just listed how many cases but
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
then they looked at okay X percentage of
 
00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
divorce cases take this long X
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
percentage of that kind of divorce case
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
really take much further and they came
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
up with a statement that we need over 20
 
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.470 align:start position:0%
up with a statement that we need over 20
more

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
judges in order to honor what is behind
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
all of the um bills that we've received
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh they understand it and we gave them
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
seven in the new budget which isn't 20
 
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
some odd but it is not nothing and uh I
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
know the chairman of Finance is already
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
prepared to give us another another
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
batch next time and he understands why
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
so not enough judges uh okay pick a date
 
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.629 align:start position:0%
so not enough judges uh okay pick a date
what

00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
judge is going to be able to to do this
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough also what happens
 
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
if one or another party churns that's a
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
stock broker term but it means just
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
flooding with more motions flooding with
 
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
demanding more evidence The Rules of
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
Evidence great book if you haven't read
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
it four times I commend it to you um
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
there is something in here that says if
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
a judge believes that the motion to
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
accept another bit of evidence does not
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
enhance the
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
case the judge May refuse to admit that
 
00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
piece of evidence and and it's so that
 
00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:54.519 align:start position:0%
people will stop petition petition
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
evidence do this do this do that uh
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
which some parties do and with that in
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
hand um how can you possibly know when
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
you're going to come to something final
 
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
if these petitions keep coming in now
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
we've got people who want to say if
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
somebody offers a piece of evidence it
 
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
shall be received that's going to do a
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
terrible thing to schedule on the other
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
hand we've got people who are angry
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
because the judge is not refusing that
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
piece of evidence and you know I think
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
the Rules of Evidence book tries to to
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
get a good balance in there so this in
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
other words this is complicated as we've
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
all been saying um I will say this
 
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
though that the uh Judiciary is paying a
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
lot of attention to Children and Family
 
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
Law bills having to do with court
 
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
process and with the discussions we're
 
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
having in the special committee on the
 
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
Family Division of the Circuit Court
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
they're paying attention and it's
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
interesting some of the things that
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
we've been disc discussing in the
 
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
special committee they're already
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
starting to work on they're already
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
getting ready to send out um bids for
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
people companies who will come in and
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
work on training issues this is
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
something we brought up they caught on
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm willing to say that um they're
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
paying attention to the idea of setting
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
some final dates as best they can given
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
all the exigencies they're working on
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
I think they're paying
 
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
attention so for that reason I would
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
also say this is this is very well
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
intended I think we understand uh why uh
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
somebody would want a date set um but
 
00:14:49.749 --> 00:14:49.759 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to join people and and
 
00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:51.110 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to join people and and
say

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
no so with that would somebody like to
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
make a motion or if we're not if we're
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
finished our discussion would somebody
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
body like to make a
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
motion representative Greg I'll make a
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%

00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%

second
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
case them Republican evil yeah you get
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
