a need for these types of stores and the
 
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 align:start position:0%

expanding into areas where they worked
 
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 align:start position:0%

question should be directed
 
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
um however if we were to return to an
 
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
earlier point in the

presentation i really miss that
 
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 align:start position:0%

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's a separate subject all right
 
00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts is he um
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
it's been somewhat of an ongoing issue
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
for us to be conscious of
 
00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 align:start position:0%
right now of total wines um
 
00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 align:start position:0%
that because they're a publicly traded
 
00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:11.029 align:start position:0%
that because they're a publicly traded
corporation

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
and their their mission in life is to uh
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%

business model
 
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
because now we have to be conscious of
 
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
where they are
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
where they're located in general
 
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.029 align:start position:0%

been the messages since prior you know
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
really limited
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh to having their grocery stores
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh in the business of selling um selling
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
the wine and liquor
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
they've now changed that you know and
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
now really upscaling it
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
so it definitely has an impact for our
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
stores along the
 
00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 align:start position:0%
along the uh on the border so primarily
 
00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:54.790 align:start position:0%
along the uh on the border so primarily
fiscal

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 align:start position:0%
it's revenue yeah excited all right so
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
we got
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
other hands okay representative
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah just like i i don't want to make
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
this a long discussion i was just very
 
00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
curious i know that this goes back to
 
00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:10.950 align:start position:0%
curious i know that this goes back to
1935.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
1935.
 
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
curious to know what was the rationale
 
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
overseeing liquor in an indus you know
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
an industry in other states that are run
 
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.550 align:start position:0%
an industry in other states that are run
by

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs i'm just curious about
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
that i assume it might have been tied to
 
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.230 align:start position:0%
that i assume it might have been tied to
prohibition

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
prohibition
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh it was absolutely uh the repeal of
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
the prohibition that if you read the
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
21st amendment it it it basically said
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
a state could stay dry if it wanted to
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
if the state wanted to be dry
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
um and then at that time uh the issue
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
was how do we
 
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh how do we bring liquor back how do we
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
get back um
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
and so each state could choose there's
 
00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:47.589 align:start position:0%
and so each state could choose there's
model

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
model
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
and like i say there's basically uh the
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
the main two models that came out of it
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
was a a free-for-all
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
or a controlled state model and and
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
which we're one of those control
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
state models and of course um we're the
 
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
most successful
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
control state model uh but um
 
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
other states have struggled with it and
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
have and become somewhat hybrids about
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
it but
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day that was the
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
decision at the time to how we
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
allow liquor to be available with uh
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
with the minimum amount of
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
problems that that forced the
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
prohibition in the first place
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yeah representative
 
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.670 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yeah representative
gleason

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
gleason
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman ladies and
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
gentlemen um my question goes back to
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
slide 10.
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh on that chart that shows the net
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
profits going back to the 1930s
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
what happened in the late 1990s to cause
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
the net profits to more than double
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
in the next 10 to 10 or so years
 
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh i i couldn't let the commission do it
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
but i believe that's when we opened up
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
wine sales and great it was wines in
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
grocery stores
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
but is that correct yep see i got that
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
okay you all said you know just put your
 
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
hand down jeff that'd be great
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
uh representative bartlett thank you um
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
i was just hoping that
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
we'll get a copy of this powerpoint yes
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely great there's no way i'm
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
going to take notes on all of this
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i i actually kind of think
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
it's good to see it and then you can go
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
back and look for it when you look for
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
the improvement but just
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
follow along with if this is a nice way
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
to do it okay
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%

377
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
licensees was it uh to one
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
um is that sufficient
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a lot of places an
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
investigator has to go to
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
it and and i'm i'm very proud to report
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
that we reach out and touch every one of
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
those licensed establishments um
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
can you always use more personnel of
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
course you can
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
but i think we're showing that the work
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
ethic in the division
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
is beyond reproach and and they're
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
they're doing an awesome job at
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
not only touching these licensed
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
establishments but growing
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
a very very good relationship that we
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
have proven
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic and that's been
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
our success in the last four years
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
one more question if i might search mr
 
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.070 align:start position:0%
one more question if i might search mr
chair

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh same thing on the auditor side i i'm
 
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
not that familiar
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh with what the all the auditors do
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
but having three auditors for the entire
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
state that sounds to me
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh us i don't know i just uh
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
unchanged for the past decade i guess
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
nothing's changed in the past 10 years
 
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.870 align:start position:0%
nothing's changed in the past 10 years
but

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious same kind of question
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
do you need more auditors
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um we have
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
actually in this area we have moved to a
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
hybrid on our smart side
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
so our uh invest our sworn investigators
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
are actually cross-trained
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
and sometimes actually go out with the
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
civilian auditors
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh but again it would be the same answer
 
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh again we are in the high 90
 
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.830 align:start position:0%
uh again we are in the high 90
percentile

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
percentile
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
on in this area um there's always room
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
to grow
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
um but uh yeah it's it's
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
it definitely is one of those areas that
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
hasn't they have done a great job back
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
there i say back there because as the
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
office is structured they're in the back
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
of the office
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
but they get the uh the primary
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
attention of all of us
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
so these are these are civilian uh
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
people they're not uh state employees
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
they are state employees but they are
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
civilians they are not sworn
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
okay they do not have law enforcement
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
authority but they do have
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
administrative authority
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i mean i you have to you
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
all these beverage managers and wine and
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
every everybody else is also you also
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
have a federal license
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
um so there's no reason why anybody's
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to want to
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
commit fraud in terms of of their
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
auditing numbers
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
um and so we are you know we uh we we do
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
a good job of

new hampshire
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
did you have a difficult time with
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
no no when we did that we
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
we have partnered with the new hampshire
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
made folks in our stores
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
okay a number of times and if and if
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
you've noted at our highway stores in
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
hampton we allow them
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
space on both sides of the highway uh
 
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
and that space has been given to them
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
for a number of years
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
and it is their most profitable uh
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
profit center
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
so as the rfp comes out to rebuild those
 
00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:38.950 align:start position:0%
so as the rfp comes out to rebuild those

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
stores
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
we will ask that that those
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
locations be kept in place so that that
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
revenue stream isn't uh
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
upset for for that group they're great
 
00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:50.470 align:start position:0%
upset for for that group they're great
partners

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
um i have a question about uh
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement and i guess
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
i guess it's enforcement and education
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
so in in new york uh governor cuomo has
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
been having
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic related press conferences
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
and he often says that his mandates will
 
00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:44.789 align:start position:0%
and he often says that his mandates will
be

00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
enforced using new york's
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
whatever they call their liquor
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
commission in new york
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
that restaurants
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
might have their liquor license revoked
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
if they don't follow
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
the mandates is that happening here in
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%

made in new hampshire is actually has
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
been an ongoing issue somewhat for the
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
for the commission and was it was in
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
terms of labeling requirements and what
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh products and what they can be labeled
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
um and that issue has been tossed around
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
the time since and as uh you know help
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
me out

00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
of what what you can say on your bottle
 
00:33:23.679 --> 00:33:23.990 align:start position:0%
of what what you can say on your bottle
of

last session there was pass that it
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%

00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
made in new hampshire produced and
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
bottled i'm not sure off the top of my
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
head what statute that was but we can
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
pass it along to you mr chairman
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
um because there's a lot of different
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
ways to to make liquor
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
and how to absolutely and
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
and each industry has its own unique uh
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
issues uh uh wine the question is where
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
are the grapes grown
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh new hampshire is not the best place
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
to be growing grapes
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh and i understand that nobody really
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
attempts to grow
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
red red wines here in new hampshire and
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's all imported
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh grape grape juice so the question is
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
then you know what where where's made in
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
if you're if in terms of you know i
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
guess if it's age in the oak barrels you
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
can prove to tell you
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
okay that's new hampshire enough so and
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
then uh we also have
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
a um another oddball product that's out
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
there for distilled
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
and um and i say it only because i love
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
the title they're they're rectified
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
and rectified um is that they take the
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
raw product um and i guess i won't
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
mention the name but there's a company
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
in salem
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
that makes a limoncello that uh that
 
00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:44.230 align:start position:0%
that makes a limoncello that uh that
imports

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
imports
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh by the truckloads of the raw vodka
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
and then they take the lemons and the
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
sugar and they make a rectified product
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
we also have a major rectifier in
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
londonderry is it
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
might get that right londonderry correct
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
and uh so the the it's not so much of an
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
issue why how they do it and how they
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
produce it
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
we're okay with that uh it becomes more
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
of a problem and that is that we
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
actually have benefits for someone who
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
is in new hampshire
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
so we uh for instance when you store
 
00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.510 align:start position:0%
so we uh for instance when you store
your

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh your wines or products in their
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
bonded warehouse we
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
waive the fee is that is that correct mr
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
chairman that is correct
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
so so we're we're somewhat conscious of
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know entity that's in in londonderry
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
who is a
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
nationwide distributor or manufacturer
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
of a product
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
um and they are rectifying and
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
and uh but they are in new hampshire and
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
so whether we we have an ongoing
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
discussion about their their bonding so
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh these are kind of nuances of what
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i have one other
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
question about
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
out-of-state buyers
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
how much can and it's probably not just
 
00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:04.630 align:start position:0%
how much can and it's probably not just
out-of-state

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
out-of-state
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
of alcoholic beverages that they can
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
purchase in a liquor store is it
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars limit per
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
individual there is no state law that
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
limits the
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
amount that someone could buy in one of
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
um said that if you spend ten thousand
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
dollars or more
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
we have another federal law that
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
requires us to report the bank well
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a requirement but
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's on uh
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
only the sale of cash 10 000 or more
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
we have to fill out a report for the irs
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
which we submit
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
but there is no law in the state of new
 
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.670 align:start position:0%
but there is no law in the state of new
hampshire

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
that prohibits us from selling any
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
alcohol to anyone from out of state
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
and when they bring that product and
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
when they bring that product into their
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
they need to pay the tax in their state
 
00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.910 align:start position:0%
they need to pay the tax in their state
that's

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's where people run afoul of the law
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
if they choose not to pay the
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
tax in their state when they bring back
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
that amount of alcohol or any amount
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
above the limits of that particular
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
state and each state is different
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh robert has another question go ahead
 
00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.790 align:start position:0%
uh robert has another question go ahead
keith

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
keith
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thanks again
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh on the previous question i think
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's called the new hampshire
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
advantage right
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
we want people to purchase things in our
 
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.710 align:start position:0%
we want people to purchase things in our
state

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
there's a great program where it's a
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's a bottle that's being sold at the
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
state store
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
that looks like the state capital and i
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
can't remember the name of it i think
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
and that's a program to raise money to
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
renovate the hall of flags at the state
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
house isn't that correct
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
that is correct representative what's
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
the status of that program is that
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
has that been successful has it raised
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
enough funds to
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
make a difference it's it's been it's
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
been very successful
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
in the i don't have the amount of money
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
that we raised
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but i think we're
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
on the fifth bottom
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh we five different bottles that we've
 
00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:26.870 align:start position:0%
uh we five different bottles that we've
done

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
to help raise money and there's more
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
is that bottled out of state that
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
that whiskey is from kentucky
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.839 --> 00:38:49.349 align:start position:0%
 
walker

00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
okay and the design and manufacture of
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
the bottle because it does look like
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
the state house with the little uh you
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
know golden
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
dome on top how to where was that
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
manufactured and and uh
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
how much overhead did that cost to
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
customize the bottle i'm not i'm not
 
00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:10.390 align:start position:0%
customize the bottle i'm not i'm not
sure

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
we're passed along a cost per bottle
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
with the alcohol in it so the breakdown
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
of the plus the bottle versus alcohol
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure of okay i mean i think it's
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
reasonably impressive thank you
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
and the commission and we've been doing
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
these bottles for
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
private label stuff but i have to admit
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
myself personally i've never
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
ever been that good i think it's your
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility you have to buy at least
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
um so before we leave i i do i i
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
remember that aidan is online and
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
because aiden will be coming in front of

happy to see direct shipping is up over
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
a million now million three so i know
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
that i'm bringing lots of
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
good revenue in the state with that with
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
awesome piece of legislation
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
you have the crystal ball working there
 
00:42:03.359 --> 00:42:04.150 align:start position:0%
you have the crystal ball working there
well

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
i was very lucky that i had a uh a
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
a chairman at that time who was uh at
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
least open to the idea the concept of it
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
and could see could see the potential so
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
that was that was a good thing but
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
but i would say that chairman there's
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
nothing like the chairman that we have
 
00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:20.550 align:start position:0%
nothing like the chairman that we have
now

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
um how long have you been chair uh joe
 
00:42:23.359 --> 00:42:24.150 align:start position:0%
um how long have you been chair uh joe
now

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh 10 years 10 years so we have an
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
excellent working relationship
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
even though i um i will often comment
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
that our liquor laws are a little
 
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.470 align:start position:0%
that our liquor laws are a little
byzantine

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
byzantine
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
and a little confusing a little why we
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
do what we do you know when you hear
 
00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:38.550 align:start position:0%
do what we do you know when you hear
that

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
50 licenses and um there
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of explanation
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
that goes on on how we got to where we
 
00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:46.230 align:start position:0%
that goes on on how we got to where we
are

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
um so so uh i know for for all your new
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
members it will be a little bit of a
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
learning curve
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
but in the end of the day um i think we
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
do you know we have an excellent
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
organization bringing in
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
more revenue than any other state can
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
ever imagine
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%

of our uh internet connection but uh i'd
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%

of the bureau and that's our our primary
 
00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.950 align:start position:0%
of the bureau and that's our our primary
functions

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
functions
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
um just uh as a as a
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
general statement the the bureau of
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
securities is essentially responsible
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
for the protection
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire investors through the
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement of rsa
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
421 b are
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
all that is really
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
best to yeah this is
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
this is not working nothing's not going
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
well barry
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
um do you mind just logging out and
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
close out your zoom and start start
 
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.829 align:start position:0%
close out your zoom and start start
afresh

00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
afresh
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
well i guess if we're gonna this won't
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
be the first time i'm sure that this
 
00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.829 align:start position:0%
be the first time i'm sure that this
occurs

00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
occurs
 
00:48:04.839 --> 00:48:09.270 align:start position:0%
occurs
but

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully um
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
so christina will when he comes back in
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
will he be in
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh under panelists or attendees because
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
i promoted him
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
he'll come in as an attendee we can bump
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
him back up um if the problem persists
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
it may be best to just have him call in
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
on the phone and that way we can hear
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
the audio but i don't know if he has a
 
00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.069 align:start position:0%
the audio but i don't know if he has a
presentation

00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
if he does he can send it to me and we
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
could put it up right
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative hunt should you should
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
you be muted
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
would that help sometimes if there's
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
just one person that's
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
um not muted might interfere with the
 
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:50.870 align:start position:0%
um not muted might interfere with the
presentation

00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i can certainly try that
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:28.839 --> 00:49:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
asleep

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
okay so i'll tell some stories um
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
so securities is actually one of the
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
newest of
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
of all our different divisions uh when
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
i just got elected back in back in the
 
00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:49.190 align:start position:0%
i just got elected back in back in the
late

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
late
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
80s um it was a stand-alone division and
 
00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.589 align:start position:0%
80s um it was a stand-alone division and
then

00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
at the time uh the decision was that
 
00:49:56.319 --> 00:49:57.270 align:start position:0%
at the time uh the decision was that
that

00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
it should be the model the business
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
model should change
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
and so now securities is actually under
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
so um so technically bill gardner is in
 
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:08.630 align:start position:0%
so um so technically bill gardner is in
charge

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
um then so barry who is our
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
director of securities um is
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
you know obviously going to making the
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
presentation when we get him back here
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
what's interesting about securities is
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
we have a we have a we there's a big
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
revenue for the state we do
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh well here okay barry's back now okay
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
um the panelists let's see how this
 
00:50:38.839 --> 00:50:40.069 align:start position:0%
um the panelists let's see how this
works

00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
okay all right okay barry you're in
 
00:50:43.599 --> 00:50:45.510 align:start position:0%
okay all right okay barry you're in
let's

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%

00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
see what happens all right okay what's
 
00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:49.750 align:start position:0%
see what happens all right okay what's
that

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's great so far both audio and video
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
audio and video you're good oh terrific
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
but i i do pardon uh
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%

just to power off my pc and clear out
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
the ram and
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
and uh the way to do it this all works
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
we'll start again again my apologies uh
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%

we get to jeff
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
um the role really of the new hampshire
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
bureau of securities is essentially to
 
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.470 align:start position:0%
bureau of securities is essentially to
protect

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
protect
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire investors through the
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
enforcement of new hampshire rsa 421b
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
which is our controlling statute
 
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
essentially our role is really to
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
promote capital formation
 
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.839 --> 00:52:04.150 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
essentially making sure
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
that so your
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
your your computer is not buffering well
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
so um i guess i would ask you to just
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
call in you have to call it the phone
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
call call in um yes i do
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
okay all right we're gonna do
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
that conference just leave that alone
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
and call it in
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
all right so we have no graphics oh so
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
you did have a presentation huh
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
yes ouch okay well i guess you can try
 
00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay can you see uh my powerpoint
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
representative uh have you have you put
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
it up because no we haven't we don't see
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
it yet
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
have i think that uh it may require that
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
you share
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh well we an understanding is you
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
i i have uh you you're our panelist and
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
i'm allowing you to share
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
okay i want to say who can start well no
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
let me put click who can start sharing
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
when someone else is sharing no you know

offices which are scattered

throughout the state and to ensure that
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%

uh we have uh outreach investor
education

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
outreach uh at this time it's it's
 
00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:15.750 align:start position:0%
outreach uh at this time it's it's
limited

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
limited
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
because of uh covet 19 restrictions
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
however we have just been primarily
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
focusing on
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
radio uh type interviews uh wgir has
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
been a great supporter
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh with the two hour program on
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
saturdays and a half hour
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh with uh with them on on thursdays
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
at least uh four times a year and then
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
our our
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
one of our more significant activities
 
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
involves uh enforcement
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh for those who have a
 
00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:45.270 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh for those who have a
violated

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
violated
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh state statute jeff's spill will be
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
providing you with a little bit more
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
insight as far as
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh some of the things that we see and
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
things that we do
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
as a bureau when it comes to enforcement
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
we are a self-funded agency all of our
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
expenses are paid through the fines and
 
00:56:04.559 --> 00:56:05.270 align:start position:0%
expenses are paid through the fines and
penalties

00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
derived through enforcement actions
 
00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:08.789 align:start position:0%
derived through enforcement actions
however

00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
the revenue that we generate by way of
 
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
securities registrations
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
um which is really uh quite significant
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh is uh uh this this fiscal year will
 
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
be we project
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
the 43 million dollars which go directly
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh to the general fund and we do that um
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
with a 12-member staff that's from the
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
front-end receptionist to
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
to the director of the bureau so we do
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
operate i think you know fairly leanly
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
although the director could use a few
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
pounds to lose but
 
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
we try to be lean as far as the
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
licensing and registration function
 
00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:45.349 align:start position:0%
licensing and registration function
again

00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
this is a very important role in that we
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
are really the gatekeeper for
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
agents in firms that that decide to do
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
business in the state
 
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
um they are required to
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
register with with the bureau
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
as well as any firm that is uh anyone
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
out looking to raise capital and doing a
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
securities offering that they file those
 
00:57:08.319 --> 00:57:09.109 align:start position:0%
securities offering that they file those
offerings

00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
offerings
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
with us and we perform a qualitative
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
review of those offerings
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
but more significantly is really the
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
broker dealer and investment advisor
 
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.630 align:start position:0%
broker dealer and investment advisor
side

00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of broker dealers as you can
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
see here
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
on the slide we license a little over
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh 1200 um broken dealers uh
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
now they are not all resident here in
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
the state uh they're
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
scattered throughout the country but we
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
do have a significant presence
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
clearly uh here in the state in terms of
 
00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.630 align:start position:0%
clearly uh here in the state in terms of
firms

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
firms
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
we have over 118 000 registered
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
representatives that we have
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh registered with us every year i can
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
see representatives hunt's
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
head shaking left and right now again
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
they are not all physically here
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the state uh however they are
 
00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.270 align:start position:0%
in the state uh however they are
licensed

00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
to do business here in the state and
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
they reach clients by way of you know
 
00:57:58.880 --> 00:57:59.270 align:start position:0%
they reach clients by way of you know
phones

00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
phones
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
how much do you hit them up on an annual
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
basis do they they pay
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
the uh annual the renewal fee is just uh
 
00:58:06.799 --> 00:58:08.150 align:start position:0%
the uh annual the renewal fee is just uh
one 100

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
one 100
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
um per licensee which is
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
i think reasonable we try to be
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
reasonable in relation to what other
 
00:58:14.079 --> 00:58:14.950 align:start position:0%
reasonable in relation to what other
states

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh also charge but there there's really
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
a significant number and as you can see
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
uh 2394 of investment advisors and
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
over 4 500 investment advisor
 
00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.589 align:start position:0%
over 4 500 investment advisor
representatives

representatives
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a large number for a
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
good reason and that is
 
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire residing of course in
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
the northeast
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
we really are a wealth center in in the
 
00:58:36.319 --> 00:58:37.109 align:start position:0%
we really are a wealth center in in the
country

00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are in the state come to
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for good reason besides
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
um you know all the benefits of living
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
in the state and in our favorable tax
 
00:58:46.079 --> 00:58:46.950 align:start position:0%
in the state and in our favorable tax
environment

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's really a great place for retirees
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
and with that you have a more older
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
population i think we are
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of our median age it's uh it's
 
00:58:56.319 --> 00:58:57.109 align:start position:0%
in terms of our median age it's uh it's
older

00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
older
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
we're actually older in terms of median
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
age in the state of florida believe it
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
so because we are a wealth center
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
because we have a more elderly
 
00:59:04.319 --> 00:59:05.910 align:start position:0%
because we have a more elderly
population

00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
we see a lot of assets
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
here that need to be managed and broker
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
dealers and investment advisors
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
recognize that
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
which is why we we really have such a
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
sizable number
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
now along with that in in jeff spell
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss this further
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
because we are a wealth center those
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
scammers those who commit fraud those
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
who violate statute
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
really find new hampshire attractive
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
because scammers go where the money is
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
and so we're never without any number of
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
cases going on
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
at any given time from out of state from
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
out of state entities
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
firms or unregistered uh individuals
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
um it it really is uh it's a significant
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
amount of activity unfortunately but
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's really what we're here for
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh we also
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
register a large number of securities
 
00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
products the vast majority of those are
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
mutual funds
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the area of 15 000 mutual
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
funds are registered
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and they pay an annual
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
fee renewal fee of a thousand dollars
 
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
per fund so it's a
 
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
significant source of revenue for
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire we also
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
perform uh in-person audits they're done
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
on an unannounced basis
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
certainly with covert 19 we've had real
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
limitations and we've been respecting
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
uh you know covert protections for those
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
entities that we regulate
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh we transitioned to more of a desk
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
audit type of format
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
for field examinations meaning we would
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
reach out to them by phone and by way of
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
a video conference like this sometimes
 
01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
with a better connection and
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh and then ask them to provide us
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
information and actually conduct
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
interviews over the phone
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
but the ideal environment really is to
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
be able to conduct them on an input and
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
in-person basis and it's really done
 
01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.589 align:start position:0%
in-person basis and it's really done
unannounced

01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
unannounced
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
so um it's it's not like as if they
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
could prepare
 
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
you know for the exam the exam is
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
roughly a one to two days
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's not like an irs exam
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
that you might see go on for quite some
 
01:01:07.599 --> 01:01:08.950 align:start position:0%
that you might see go on for quite some
time

01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
we do approximately one 100 exams on
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
an annual basis um uh this year i
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
i still think we'll be at that number
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
given the number of desk exams
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
we've done and and you may ask well how
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
do we select
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
them it's not like it's necessarily just
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
because they were examined four years
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
ago and due for exam
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
we actually have a more formal
 
01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.150 align:start position:0%
we actually have a more formal
risk-based

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
risk-based
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
um uh process for determining who
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
in what firm really what branch office
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
should be examined on a more
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
regular basis based upon what we may
 
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
have experienced
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
in a prior review certainly if it's a
 
01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.150 align:start position:0%
in a prior review certainly if it's a
new

01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
office we will
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
examine them then make certain
 
01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.670 align:start position:0%
examine them then make certain
evaluations

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
evaluations
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
patients you're you're you're slowing
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
down again
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
here so coming okay
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
no no
 
01:02:13.039 --> 01:02:16.230 align:start position:0%
no no
no

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh in which requirements to
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
them uh with
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
let's talk slowly i don't know i don't
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
know i don't know what's going on here
 
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
but i guess keep going how much more we
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh yeah like you keep freezing you keep
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know yeah
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh representative um mr glenn
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
did you want to try and call in
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
with the telephone and uh just keep your
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
your video on but disconnect the audio
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
so that at least we can hear you okay
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
so you have a phone phone barrier are
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
you calling yeah
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so what you can do is uh where you
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
have the mute button at the bottom
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
there's a little arrow if you
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh it will say um switch to phone audio
 
01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
and then or leave computer audio rather
 
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
and then you can use the phone
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
right but he just he has to call log in
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
separately with the phone we call in
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.839 --> 01:04:34.390 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
um just for anybody else's listening
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
just to remind everybody that we will
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
invite lobbyists to introduce themselves
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
all right so it looks like we have a
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
caller um in attendees i don't know if
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
that caller was there before but i don't
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
think so
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
i wasn't okay so do i
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
allow to talk and we'll ask yep okay
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
is it and he's he's muted on his end how
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
does he um
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
star six will unmute so caller if that
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
are um mr glennon could you press star
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
if that's him right right uh
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
i don't know it see
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
it's funny because it has the last three
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
digits i can't tell whether it's a 271
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
number knowing that it would that would
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
be a state number but
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's all right asterisks
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh so whoever is calling in in your last
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
three digits is four
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
five nine do you mind just hitting star
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
oh here's another one just popped up oh
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
okay maybe that's it then let's uh
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
all right i'm gonna click this one
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to talk okay
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
so barry if that's you star six
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
turn the audio off on your computer
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
you're gonna get a lot of feedback how's
 
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
that now
 
01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's perfect great okay so
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh not sure where you were um
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
that's cool you had you had email
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
contacts address
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
up for people i think is what i saw
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
i stopped the screen share so that we
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
would give him some confidentiality
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
so he'll just have to start the screen
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
so you can you can start sharing again
 
01:07:26.839 --> 01:07:42.309 align:start position:0%
so you can you can start sharing again
okay

01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
okay cool we're there
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.839 --> 01:07:56.230 align:start position:0%
 
great

01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:05.029 align:start position:0%
great
okay

01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh but now i can't hear you you're still
 
01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
on the phone right here
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
yeah all right okay so
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh audio did you hear
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh well uh i we talked about licensing
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
and i was
 
01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
remarking you know about how many
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
registered broker dealer agents
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
which are bringing in over a million
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
dollars of licensing them
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
100 bucks a year so let's try the next
 
01:08:33.679 --> 01:08:36.829 align:start position:0%
100 bucks a year so let's try the next
screen

01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.839 --> 01:08:38.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh field examinations uh hopefully this
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
is new ground
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
no you did exist yeah i don't know if it
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
could be heard actually uh
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
on audits okay
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
okay so we do conduct uh field audits of
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
our broker dealer offices and investment
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
advisory offices
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh they are done typically on a
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
unannounced basis
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
uh because of covid we've had some
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
restrictions clearly being able to visit
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
those offices
 
01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
but have reverted have reverted to desk
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
examinations which
 
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
are effective we took the low risk
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
entities and
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
examined them rather than what we would
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
deem some of the higher risk
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
offices around the state
 
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
that has been going uh very well but
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise they're typically done
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
on an unannounced basis to determine
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
whether they have actually
 
01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
complied uh with securities laws
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
including disclosure
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
review of client files for product
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
suitability and
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
and a number of other metrics that we
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
actually look at
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
but we do a little over typically on a
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
good year over 100
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
we're also responsible for the oversight
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
of risk pools
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
pursuant to rsa 5b there are three such
 
01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.149 align:start position:0%
pursuant to rsa 5b there are three such
pools

01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
pools
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
in the state health trust new hampshire
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
being one of the largest ones
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
they have certain annual financial
 
01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.110 align:start position:0%
they have certain annual financial
filings

01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
filings
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
and also also actuarial filings that are
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
made with the secretary of state's
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
office each year
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
and we monitor those uh we look at those
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
do in-person examinations uh of
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
but our one of our uh more significant
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
functions really is uh you know
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
protection of new hampshire investors
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
and responding to
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
those who may have been harmed by either
 
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
one of our licensees or
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
unlicensed individuals that
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
are trying to commit fraud or any form
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
of misrepresentation
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire investors jeff spill
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
is our deputy director of enforcement
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
he's here unfortunately because of
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
of video issues i i can't portray him
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
there at least i don't know if i can i
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
don't care i don't want to lose our
 
01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.630 align:start position:0%
don't care i don't want to lose our
signal

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
signal
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
but uh jeff has been uh with the bureau
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
for a little over 21 years now at this
 
01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:09.669 align:start position:0%
for a little over 21 years now at this
point

01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh and uh has been deputy
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
director of enforcement for that entire
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
period so i'll turn it over to jeff
 
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit about what we do in
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
that area
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
jeff good morning and thank you for this
 
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address the committee
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
as barry said i'm in charge of
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement and
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
the two main ways we start an
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement matter is through a
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
written complaint or a complaint by a
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
resident of the state of new hampshire
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
we can also get complaints from out of
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
state individuals who do business in new
 
01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:44.709 align:start position:0%
state individuals who do business in new
hampshire

01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
or if the transaction occurred in new
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the other way is through
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
investigations that we initiate on our
 
01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.270 align:start position:0%
investigations that we initiate on our
own

01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
the statute 421b has sweeping
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
authority for us to conduct
 
01:11:58.159 --> 01:11:59.590 align:start position:0%
authority for us to conduct
investigations

01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
accumulate evidence take testimony under
 
01:12:02.159 --> 01:12:03.030 align:start position:0%
accumulate evidence take testimony under
oath

01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
oath
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
and the culmination of that if we
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
determine that
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
the statute has been violated is we have
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
a hearings process
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
which is headed up by a hearings
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
examiner appointed by the secretary of
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
state usually
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
somebody from our office and uh the
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
decisions that are made
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
can render sanctions which range from
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
restitution paid to the harmed investor
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
discouragement of ill-gotten gains
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
administrative fines
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
and costs of our investigation are the
 
01:12:33.199 --> 01:12:34.149 align:start position:0%
and costs of our investigation are the
primary

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
tools we utilize we can also bar
 
01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.350 align:start position:0%
tools we utilize we can also bar
individuals

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
firms and and agents that have violated
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
typically we get about 70 complaints and
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh investigations uh we
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
usually uh bring about
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
half of those as actual enforcement
 
01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.430 align:start position:0%
half of those as actual enforcement
matters

01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
matters
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh the other half we would close as as
 
01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.110 align:start position:0%
uh the other half we would close as as
uh

01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
not actionable either because there's a
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
lack of evidence or
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
maybe some other reason that precludes
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
us from going forward
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
we also are short of actually
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
bringing enforcement action can provide
 
01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
assistance to the public
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
on questions of uh
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
need for the for the individual it could
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
be a question about their account it
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
could be a problem they're having
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
with an agent or a firm it could be
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
um you know just having them uh
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
a particular issue that they want to see
 
01:13:34.719 --> 01:13:36.390 align:start position:0%
a particular issue that they want to see
resolved

01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
so we've kind of pride ourselves in
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
being an open door
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
policy for enforcement action and for
 
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
enforcing the statutes we don't turn

covert has affected

enforcement and we've been able to
 
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
navigate through that very effectively
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
been able to
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
our sanctioning power we have
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%

01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
other enforcement type issues that we
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
there is a new statute online called
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
financial exploitation of vulnerable
 
01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:09.750 align:start position:0%
financial exploitation of vulnerable
doubts

01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
doubts
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
that has been put in place to
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
protect vulnerable adults from scammers
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
in the sense that scammers can gain
 
01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:19.590 align:start position:0%
in the sense that scammers can gain
access

01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
illegal access to their accounts or
 
01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
through their scam deceive vulnerable
 
01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.110 align:start position:0%
through their scam deceive vulnerable
adults

01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
adults
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
in uh either believing that they are
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with a real person or a real
 
01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.149 align:start position:0%
dealing with a real person or a real
firm

01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
firm
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
or real securities transaction when it's
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
actually fraudulent
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
and the way we can effectively do that
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
is not only through the enforcement
 
01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:40.470 align:start position:0%
is not only through the enforcement
process

01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
but the statute allows the account to be
 
01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.510 align:start position:0%
but the statute allows the account to be
frozen

01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
frozen
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
by the firm so that money can't be
 
01:15:45.679 --> 01:15:47.510 align:start position:0%
by the firm so that money can't be
withdrawn

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
withdrawn
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
or so that funds are stabilized
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
and access is denied to the funds and so
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
such time as the bureau can determine
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
whether there's an enforcement action
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
that needs to be taken
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
or safety precautions put in place we
 
01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:04.470 align:start position:0%
or safety precautions put in place we
also

01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
bring what we call global enforcement
 
01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.669 align:start position:0%
bring what we call global enforcement
issues

01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%

01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
um some of the scams that we encounter
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
that have been a far far reaching impact
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
nationally romance scams where
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
individuals pose

vulnerable doubts as a romantic interest
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
and through that romantic interest drain
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%

uh phony securities deals uh where the

securities product
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist or doesn't do what is
 
01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.189 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist or doesn't do what is
promised

01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
promised
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh phony securities

actually exist
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
and a lot of this now is unfortunately
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
perpetrated on the internet
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
where people can log on and believe that
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with actual people
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
and actual firms when they're really
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
scammers posing as such
 
01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
and that's um essentially
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
my presentation on enforcement
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you jeff uh i'd also just like to
 
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:34.310 align:start position:0%

01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
brief period about six weeks but then
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
returned to the annex we are located on
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
the third floor
 
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%

general's office
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
kind of had it on the back burner for
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
many years but in 1943
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's legislature said we need
 
01:21:41.679 --> 01:21:42.550 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's legislature said we need
to

01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%

01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
pay attention to the assets that people
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
have left in their wills and trusts etc
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
for charitable purposes and maybe aren't
 
01:21:49.679 --> 01:21:50.790 align:start position:0%
for charitable purposes and maybe aren't
being

01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
used the way they are supposed to be
 
01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:56.510 align:start position:0%
so our office
 
01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:57.830 align:start position:0%
so our office
[Music]

01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%

01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
requires uh charitable trusts charitable
 
01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.709 align:start position:0%
requires uh charitable trusts charitable
organizations

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
to register with us and to file annual
 
01:22:06.159 --> 01:22:07.430 align:start position:0%
to register with us and to file annual
reports

01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
reports
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
those annual reports include a financial
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
statement they include a list of the
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
board of directors
 
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
and they include a conflict of interest
 
01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:18.070 align:start position:0%
and they include a conflict of interest
statement

01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
all of that information is available
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
to the public unfortunately um
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
we don't have all of that information
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
posted online i'd love to be able to do
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
that the way you
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state does it and
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
someday we will
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
we are moving um and hopefully within
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
the next month we'll allow our charities
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
to file
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
these forms electronically uh which will
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
make things a lot easier for them
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
um the next step after that will be to
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
get the information posted
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
so that the public will be able to see
 
01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.669 align:start position:0%
so that the public will be able to see
that

01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%

and we'll get back to organizations if
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
they have if we have issues with them
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
and if there's a problem that emerges we
 
01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:37.030 align:start position:0%
and if there's a problem that emerges we
will

01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
begin an investigation and
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh we have the authority to sabina folks
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
and bring them in
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
and uh may uh
 
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
conduct enforcement activities if
 
01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.229 align:start position:0%
conduct enforcement activities if
necessary

01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that the people who
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
are donating money
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
um or uh have contracts with the state
 
01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:58.149 align:start position:0%
um or uh have contracts with the state
government

01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh are in fact uh being well served
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
by dealing with charitable organizations
 
01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:05.030 align:start position:0%
by dealing with charitable organizations
and

01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
and we're also we we like to say we
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
would rather educate
 
01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
than regulate we recognize that these
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
are volunteer
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
board members that are governing the
 
01:24:15.199 --> 01:24:16.709 align:start position:0%
board members that are governing the
organization

01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
and they're doing it uh nights and
 
01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.070 align:start position:0%
and they're doing it uh nights and
weekends

01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
weekends
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
and so we again we'd rather
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
educate them than regulate them and so
 
01:24:26.159 --> 01:24:26.550 align:start position:0%
educate them than regulate them and so
we

01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
we come at it with that um
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
viewpoint we want to promote the uh
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
growth and prosperity of the nonprofit
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%

very
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
important and it it includes everything
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%

01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
dartmouth college and the hospitals
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
on the on the higher side now
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
churches are exempt from reporting to us
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh however to the extent that churches
 
01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:03.350 align:start position:0%
uh however to the extent that churches
hold

01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
hold
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
restricted funds endowments we do have
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
oversight there
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the donors who may
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
have left money
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
for a particular restricted purpose that
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
we have a couple of other activities
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
that we perform
 
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
in in our charitable trust unit
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
healthcare acquisition transactions and
 
01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:29.110 align:start position:0%
healthcare acquisition transactions and
you

01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
probably know something about that it
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
seems that every hospital in the state
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
wants to merge with every other hospital
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
so that for the past five years we've
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
been very busy
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
we review those transactions
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
with an eye towards seeing whether the
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
board of directors conducted adequate
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
due diligence
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
was it in the best interest of the
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
hospital itself
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
and is it in the best interest of the
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
communities they serve
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes um the result of our review
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
is that we'll we will let the or
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
the uh transaction go forward but we'll
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
put some conditions on
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
it or we may object to it
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
and we have some that are pending now
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
but uh over half of the hospitals in the
 
01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:20.070 align:start position:0%
but uh over half of the hospitals in the
state

01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
have gone through some type of
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
transaction that we've reviewed over the
 
01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:25.110 align:start position:0%
transaction that we've reviewed over the
past

01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
five years and and the activity
 
01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.189 align:start position:0%
five years and and the activity
continues

01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
continues
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
another area we look at are conservation
 
01:26:31.679 --> 01:26:32.310 align:start position:0%
another area we look at are conservation
easement

01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
easement
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
amendments most people when they don't
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
when the
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
when conservation easements get created
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
on a parcel of land let's say somebody
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
has 40 acres of woodlands or
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
40 acres of farmland they might donate
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
it or
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
have a bargain sale to a conservation
 
01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.470 align:start position:0%
have a bargain sale to a conservation
organization

01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
um and then a few years down the road
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
maybe the
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
the the landowner gets
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
second thoughts and and says well wait a
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
minute you know maybe i do want to put
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
another house on that property or
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
gee maybe i do want to
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
start you know having weddings in the
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
barn or something like that
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
and um so we have a process to review
 
01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
those in some cases they may need to
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
take a trip
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
to court but the the bottom line is
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
if if somebody's donated a conservation
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
easement saying that they'll never
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
develop their property
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
um you can't take that back um
 
01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
and and it's the obligation of the uh
 
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
conservation organization to enforce
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
that that that's why they hold it
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
um we also um
 
01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
require the registration of
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
who make those fun time dinner phone
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
calls to you
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
asking to donate money to the police
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
relief association
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
or a conservation group etc um
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
they have a first amendment right to do
 
01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
that uh but we require them to register
 
01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:08.149 align:start position:0%
that uh but we require them to register
we

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
we want to see what the script is that
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
they're that they are
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
um giving out
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
when they're calling people and we
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
require a bond
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
from that and we do occasionally uh
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
investigate those organizations and and
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
there are some scam charities out there
 
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
and we've shut them down
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
together with offices like ours in other
 
01:28:30.159 --> 01:28:31.830 align:start position:0%
together with offices like ours in other
states

01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
we also um require the uh
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
notices of charitable gift annuities
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
that that um
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh charities offer and there may be a
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
bill relating to that
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh in front of your committee i haven't
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
looked at the text of it but
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
there might be something that will come
 
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
before your committee relating
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
to that um so that's the sort of work
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
do um and uh if i were to say is there
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
is there a trend that you're paying
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
attention to i would say
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
it's online giving um
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know you know people set up gofundme
 
01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:10.390 align:start position:0%
you know you know people set up gofundme
campaigns

01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
campaigns
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh a lot and that's great um
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
if people set up a gofundme campaign to
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
help pay their own medical bills or
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
their pets medical bills etc
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
that is not charity in the
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
technical sense it's giving from by one
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
individual to another individual is not
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
charity that is uh governed by us
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
so we don't review that but
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of charities have also found that
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
online giving is a very efficient way to
 
01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:43.350 align:start position:0%
online giving is a very efficient way to
raise

01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
raise
 
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
money and the cost of doing so is much
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
better than
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
than hiring those paid fundraisers so we
 
01:29:50.719 --> 01:29:51.430 align:start position:0%
than hiring those paid fundraisers so we
encourage

01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
charities to be using online giving
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
they just need to be careful in how it's
 
01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:58.310 align:start position:0%
they just need to be careful in how it's
done

01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
and um you know you have campaigns like
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
amazon smiles
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
paypal giving fund other ways that
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
people can give
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of creativity out
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
there we're
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
thinking that we don't have a lot of
 
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
ways to
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on it we don't want to
 
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
discourage that kind of giving
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
but there have been some abuses and so
 
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying this year but but in some
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
year in the future there might be
 
01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.110 align:start position:0%
year in the future there might be
something

01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
some legislation for this committee to
 
01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
consider that will
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
mainly make it clear to the public when
 
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
they're giving
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
what the what the fees are that the
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
platforms are taking out
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
who's really getting the money etc so
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
that's the sort of thing we're looking
 
01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:45.510 align:start position:0%
that's the sort of thing we're looking
at

01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
but certainly making sure that people
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
know it's not tax deductible
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
you know if it's not a 501 c 3 you're
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
you're you're giving money you're not
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
don't try to get a donation well and
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
yeah no that's absolutely right
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh sherman so if you give if i put
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
up a campaign on gofundme for you to
 
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
pay the veterinary bills for my dog
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
um you can't deduct that off of your
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
taxes it's going to be a
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
501 c 3 charity uh and and
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
you're right sometimes people get uh
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
confused about that
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
we also have some things for some
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
political action committees that
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
that are maybe raising money on the web
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
um and people might also be
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
confused and saying hey maybe i can
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
deduct that well you can't
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
if it's if it's an advocacy organization
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
those donations are not tax deductible
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's charitable
 
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
some charitable organizations can do
 
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
advocacy they can't do political
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
campaign type stuff
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
so the and and so that's that's another
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
area where the public can get confused
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
very touchy issue yep yep great well
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you tom i appreciate that
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
and uh uh unless anybody has any
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
particular questions for oh we do have a
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
couple questions
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh we'll start with you jane can you get
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
your hand up first before you
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
turn right yes so thank you mr chair
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you tom for taking my question
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
um those calls that ask
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
um people for money for
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
police fund or fireman fund
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
do you know how much money actually goes
 
01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:28.470 align:start position:0%
do you know how much money actually goes
to

01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh the police versus the people that
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
administer the calls
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
so if they're registered with us yes we
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
find out
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
and you'd be surprised to learn how
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
little goes
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
most of it goes to those fundraisers i
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
mean i i would
 
01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
say often less than 50 percent goes to
 
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
those police and fire and what a point
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
in time you guys did a bad boy list you
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
had you
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
that you printed and and i did some of
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
them were
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
like ten percent yeah oh yeah sometimes
 
01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
ninety percent goes to the fundraiser
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
and only ten percent of the chair so you
 
01:33:02.719 --> 01:33:03.030 align:start position:0%
and only ten percent of the chair so you
still

01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
maintain that list or you still have i
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
haven't um so we have
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
yeah we have it we you know that's a
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
good idea maybe we ought to publicize
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
that again
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
that list off again and yeah especially
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
you know in giving
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
giving season so yeah and just to follow
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
up i just want to make a comment
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
um mr donovan's office i mean
 
01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
they're so accessible and um he'll spend
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
as much time as he needs
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
with you if you have any questions
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
regarding non-profits or any of the
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
matters that he brought forward today
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
thanks tom
 
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you next up is anita burroughs
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs you have a
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
question mr
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you tom for taking my
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you prefer to educate
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
them legislate
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
and you know i'm in a town we have a ton
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
of small nonprofits
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
by volunteers but very often the board
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
crosses over
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
and and takes over the executive
 
01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
director's function
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
or the executive director is really
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
managing the board
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
at what what's this what's the tipping
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
point for you in terms of
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
taking action uh because i'm just seeing
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
this a lot and again i know it's
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
volunteers but i find it frustrating
 
01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:11.270 align:start position:0%
volunteers but i find it frustrating
that

01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
they're not following you know they're
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
so will um when we hear about these
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
situations we'll talk to board members
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
and saying
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
you know your role is to be uh
 
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
leadership in governed you're not there
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
to manage
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
or micromanage and um
 
01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
we've done a little bit of what i'd call
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
marriage counseling um
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
between board members the board of
 
01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
directors and
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
and the executive director is who's in
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
what lane etc
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
but that when the the
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
um executive director reports to the
 
01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:50.950 align:start position:0%
um executive director reports to the
board

01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh the board hires and fires the
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
executive director it's the one
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
staff person that that they supervise
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
but but the board has to understand that
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
um if you don't like the executive
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
director maybe you can fire the person
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
but you got to let the executive
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
director do
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
his or her job thank you
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
and representative herbert has a
 
01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.149 align:start position:0%
and representative herbert has a
question

01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
mr donovan how are you fine thanks
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
um would it be within the purview of the
 
01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.030 align:start position:0%
um would it be within the purview of the
legislature

01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
to require that at least a minimum
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
amount of the money raised
 
01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
go to i mean could we do that kind of
 
01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:32.950 align:start position:0%
go to i mean could we do that kind of
thing

01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
or or should we even try
 
01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm i would caution you states have
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
tried to do that
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh and they've been slapped down at
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
least three times by the u.s supreme
 
01:35:45.679 --> 01:35:46.790 align:start position:0%
least three times by the u.s supreme
court

01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
um and that happened back in the 1980s
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
and yes it was pretty common for states
 
01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
to have these things and
 
01:35:58.709 --> 01:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
the paid fundraiser community is
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
we're pretty much limited to
 
01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:06.629 align:start position:0%
we're pretty much limited to
registration

01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
and publication of of their fees that's
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
it should we do a 501c3
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
to fund uh taking it to the supreme
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
not a serious question right we all we
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
all know uh
 
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
please put me on your do not call list
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
uh it should be
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's mantra um you know when when
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
you get these uh the associations i was
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
rather surprised i remember
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
when we put in this bill to regulate
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
this liz hager from concord actually was
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
and um and i remember when we were first
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
coming in and i was kind of
 
01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
amazed of how the professionals and and
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
who do this and their poor and not
 
01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:50.870 align:start position:0%
who do this and their poor and not
necessarily

01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%

bureau chief of this bureau
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of different functions
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
um but all and i'll try to hit on each
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
of them as much as i can i know i have a
 
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
time limit
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
but the core of the work that we do in
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection antitrust bureau
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
to sum it up is those that are engaging
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
in trade or commerce within the state
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know those that
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
are selling goods selling services to
 
01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:49.270 align:start position:0%
are selling goods selling services to
consumers

01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
we insure and we ensure that they are
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
acting fairly
 
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
with consumers we ensure that they are
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
not deceiving consumers we ensure that
 
01:37:59.590 --> 01:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
working to create unfair
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
um pricing or price fixing or
 
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
creating monopolies that would have an
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
adverse effect on competition
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
and on the consumers of the state of new
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we do that through a
 
01:38:14.709 --> 01:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
variety of different functions
 
01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
at the core of the work that we do is
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's consumer protection act
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
which is rsa 358a and
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
what the consumer protection act does is
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
it makes it illegal for those that are
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
engaged in trade traitor commerce in the
 
01:38:31.270 --> 01:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
um to do a variety of different things
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're specifically listed in the
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
statute but
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
the type of conduct that's generally
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
prohibited is anything that is unfair
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
or deceptive and there are several
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
specific examples
 
01:38:47.350 --> 01:38:47.360 align:start position:0%
of that such as conduct like offering
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
goods or
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
services and representing them as
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
something that they're not
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
representing them to be of a specific
 
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
quality when in fact that's not true
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
or representing them to be endorsed by a
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
specific organization when in fact
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's not true
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
things like that but then there's a
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
general prohibition against any unfair
 
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.590 align:start position:0%
general prohibition against any unfair
deceptive

01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
deceptive
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
conduct in the process of engaging in
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
trade or commerce
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
in the state and so the way we enforce
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
that statute
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
is through a consumer protection hotline
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's open five days a week anybody in
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
the state can call in
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
call into our hotline and they can talk
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
to a real person it used to be
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
it used to be run 100 by volunteers uh
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has impacted that
 
01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
gratefully i mean greatly um we do have
 
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
a couple still
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
but um we're much slower to respond than
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
we used to be it used to be that you
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
could call in and talk to somebody
 
01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:39.750 align:start position:0%
could call in and talk to somebody
instantly

01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
instantly
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
now we have a little bit of a lag but we
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
do try to return all calls within 24
 
01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.109 align:start position:0%
do try to return all calls within 24
hours

01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
anyone that thinks that they've been
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
wronged in trade or commerce in new
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire can call in
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
talk to a real person and an attorney in
 
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
this bureau will look at their problem
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
and determine whether it's something
 
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
that the consumer protection bureau has
 
01:39:58.950 --> 01:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
the authority to take action on
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
we get about 7 500 calls and inquiries a
 
01:40:02.239 --> 01:40:02.790 align:start position:0%
we get about 7 500 calls and inquiries a
year

01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
and that number seems to be growing
 
01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
every year of that
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
we receive thousands of complaints every
 
01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:10.310 align:start position:0%
we receive thousands of complaints every
year

01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
that are actually amount to a potential
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
violation of new hampshire's consumer
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
for which we open an official complaint
 
01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:18.470 align:start position:0%
for which we open an official complaint
matter

01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
matter
 
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
and we reach out to the business to try
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
to resolve this
 
01:40:23.109 --> 01:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
and so because of the volume and the
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
limited resources that we have
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
you know we we receive a lot of stuff
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
where we serve
 
01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
almost in a mediation type role you know
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
minor things for example you know if
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
a so somebody you know contracts to
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
build a house
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
and you know there's a disagreement on
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know the quality
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
of what was going to be used and the
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
consumer complains to us and we're able
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
to reach out to the person that built
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
they're able to give their side of the
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
story to us and we're able to say well
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know is there a solution here that
 
01:40:57.669 --> 01:40:57.679 align:start position:0%
can you know get both parties to a place
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
where they're comfortable and oftentimes
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
there is and we're able to do that just
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
through some communication
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
and through some strongly worded letters
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
from the attorney general's office that
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
tend to get the attention of businesses
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
in a way that
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know calls and emails from consumers
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
just can't
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
so we mediate a lot of these um and
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
quite successfully you know we recover
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars for
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
consumers every year
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
just through that mediation process
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes the conduct that we see
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes is serious enough
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
that it's not something that simply
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
needs to be mediated it's something that
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
requires an enforcement action by this
 
01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:36.550 align:start position:0%
requires an enforcement action by this
office

01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
and so the consumer protection act gives
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
to this bureau the ability to
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
bring civil enforcement actions against
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
a business that violates the consumer
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
protection act and a civil enforcement
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
action gives us the ability
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
to ask for a financial penalty of up to
 
01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars per violation
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
also gives us the ability to ask the
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
court for
 
01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
injunctive terms which would prevent the
 
01:42:01.590 --> 01:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
business from acting in
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
a similar way in the future and in some
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
cases we're actually able to have the
 
01:42:05.199 --> 01:42:06.149 align:start position:0%
cases we're actually able to have the
court

01:42:06.149 --> 01:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
close businesses down if they've
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
sufficiently violated the consumer
 
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
protection act we can impose
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions that prevent them from
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
continuing to do business
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire we also
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
have the ability to bring
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
criminal violations of the consumer
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
protection act if we determine
 
01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
that the conduct is egregious enough and
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
depending on whether we bring a charge
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
against an individual say there's one
 
01:42:30.149 --> 01:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
bad actor in a business who violates the
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act
 
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
lying to consumers deceiving consumers
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
stealing from consumers
 
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
if it's against an individual it's a
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor level offense which means
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
they can go to jail for up to a year
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
we also have the ability to bring a
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
felony level consumer protection act
 
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
violation case against
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
the corporation or the entity itself
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
which carries with it
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
a penalty of up to a hundred thousand
 
01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
dollar fine which is a very significant
 
01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:55.990 align:start position:0%
dollar fine which is a very significant
remedy

01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
remedy
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
for most businesses so we
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
receive these complaints we evaluate
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
them we have attorneys
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
investigators who are sworn law
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
we have a financial analyst that's able
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
to look through and
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know document intensive cases that's
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
able to you know analyze documents in
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
order to give us a better picture of
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
we have a team of dedicated paralegals
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
and support staff
 
01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
and through this process we regularly
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
bring both
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
civil and criminal enforcement actions
 
01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
for violations of new hampshire's
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
and you know this has become more
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
important i think this year than ever
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
before i think the work of the bureau is
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
always important but the pandemic has
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
really given
 
01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
wave to a whole new world of consumer
 
01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:38.550 align:start position:0%
wave to a whole new world of consumer
protection

01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
protection
 
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
violations that we weren't seeing before
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh and some of them are you know just
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
starting to happen right now you know as
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
we move
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
towards a vaccine in the promise of you
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
know a vaccine being available to
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
different people at different periods of
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
times it's really it's created
 
01:43:57.669 --> 01:43:57.679 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for people to really take
 
01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
advantage of that situation and
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
it leads to what i'll explain to you is
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
a classic violation of
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
a classic example of unfair and
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
deceptive conduct so what we're seeing
 
01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:07.510 align:start position:0%
deceptive conduct so what we're seeing
is

01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
people posting advertisements people
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
making representations
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
people sending out mailers that are
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
advertising the ability to pay money to
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
reserve your spot to get a vaccine
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
or to pay money to you know cut the line
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
to get a vaccine
 
01:44:27.510 --> 01:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
we also see people that are advertising
 
01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:29.350 align:start position:0%
we also see people that are advertising
products

01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
often nutrients supplements various
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
different things that they advertise as
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
being able to prevent covid
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
or to treat covid um those types of
 
01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:40.870 align:start position:0%
or to treat covid um those types of
representations

01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
representations
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
um are simply false and you know it's
 
01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
those types of representations
 
01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
saying to a consumer in commerce i can
 
01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
sell you this product
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
it will have this effect when in reality
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
the person selling the product has no
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable basis to to make that
 
01:44:54.239 --> 01:44:55.510 align:start position:0%
reasonable basis to to make that
statement

01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
or they create a representation that
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to administer a
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
vaccine when in fact
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
there's no ability to buy your way to a
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine there's no ability to save your
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
spot in line
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
um and so through those sorts of
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
fraudulent conduct we do see people that
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
are trying to take advantage
 
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic and i think i'd like to
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
think that we've made a big difference
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
in protecting
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
consumers from falling victim to those
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
types of scams
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
and frauds throughout the course of the
 
01:45:21.199 --> 01:45:22.950 align:start position:0%
and frauds throughout the course of the
pandemic

01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
so there it does come with some um
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
exemptions we're not able to look at
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
everything and the exemptions
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
of certain conduct is specifically
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
exempt from the consumer protection act
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
if it is the type of conduct that is
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
regulated by
 
01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%
certain other state agencies those being
 
01:45:41.679 --> 01:45:42.070 align:start position:0%
certain other state agencies those being
the

01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
bureau of uh the department of insurance
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
the department of banking
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
the bureau of securities regulation who
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
we just heard from and the public
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
utilities commission so if
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
if actors are engaging in unfair
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
deceptive acts or practices
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
and it's uh let's say a mortgaging
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
company that's regulated by the banking
 
01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:58.470 align:start position:0%
company that's regulated by the banking
department

01:45:58.470 --> 01:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
the banking department has its own
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
unfair deceptive acts or practices
 
01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:02.390 align:start position:0%
unfair deceptive acts or practices
statute

01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able to take action on
 
01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
that that's something the banking
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
in addition to 358a the consumer
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
we also enforce rsa 356 which
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
we call the antitrust act what it
 
01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:19.109 align:start position:0%
we call the antitrust act what it
prohibits

01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
prohibits
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
is monopolies combinations
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
price fixing those types of transactions
 
01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:25.990 align:start position:0%
price fixing those types of transactions
that

01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
work to lessen competition and lessen
 
01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:29.510 align:start position:0%
work to lessen competition and lessen
consumer

01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
choice in the state of new hampshire and
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
a great example of this
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
as you know attorney donovan said during
 
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
his presentation
 
01:46:39.669 --> 01:46:39.679 align:start position:0%
the charitable trust division looks at
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
hospital combinations for certain
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
certain reasons that he articulated the
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
antitrust division of the consumer
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
protection bureau
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
looks at them to determine whether or
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
not they violate 356
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
which like the consumer protection act
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
has both civil and criminal penalties so
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's a law enforcement statute
 
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
that if two entities like as you're
 
01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
aware you know hospitals are the
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
the hot ticket combination in the state
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
right now if two entities try to merge
 
01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:08.070 align:start position:0%
right now if two entities try to merge
together

01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
we review that transaction to determine
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
whether if successful and
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
if completed in the form that's
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
currently proposed
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
that transaction will have the effect of
 
01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
reducing competition and reducing
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
consumer choice in new hampshire
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
and if it does we have the ability to
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
file a suit essentially asking the court
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
to block that transaction
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
prevent it from happening also we see
 
01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
this less
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
now really what the antitrust work
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's focused on right now is these
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
mergers and combinations but
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
we would also have the ability to look
 
01:47:45.679 --> 01:47:46.149 align:start position:0%
we would also have the ability to look
at

01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
price fixing schemes agreements between
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
different companies that they're going
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
to set their prices
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
sufficiently high so that it while it
 
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
appears consumers actually have choice
 
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
and there's an open market what they're
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
doing is gradually driving prices up
 
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
without consumers even knowing it based
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
on agreements between
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
two or more businesses so that they can
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
each profit in turn
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
we currently are prosecuting along with
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
almost every other state in the country
 
01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
several suits against various generic
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
prescription drug manufacturing
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
companies in the country throughout the
 
01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:21.430 align:start position:0%
companies in the country throughout the
country

01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
that were doing just this were basically
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
working with each other to make sure
 
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:28.719 align:start position:0%
that the cost of prescription drugs
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
for each of their companies was as high
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
as possible and eliminating the ability
 
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
for a free market to
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
allow the better product to to be the
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
higher product and
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
consumers to choose you know between a
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
generic product and a brand name product
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
that choice was essentially eliminated
 
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
based on the lawsuits that we've brought
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
um and so that's a really good example
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
of you know price fixing
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
and how our bureau in conjunction with
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
all the other attorney general's office
 
01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:56.719 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
state can review and bring a
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial action if people violate
 
01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
the um antitrust statute and so the
 
01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
the context of working with other states
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
is also very important
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know i've talked about you know how
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
we would bring
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act or antitrust
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
violations on an individual basis you
 
01:49:18.070 --> 01:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
know new hampshire ver the state of new
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire versus an individual
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
there's also much much bigger consumer
 
01:49:23.199 --> 01:49:23.830 align:start position:0%
there's also much much bigger consumer
protection

01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
protection
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
work being done throughout the country
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
where all of or the majority of state's
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
attorneys general's offices
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
will pool together to take on bigger
 
01:49:32.719 --> 01:49:33.830 align:start position:0%
will pool together to take on bigger
companies

01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
we've recently filed lawsuits against
 
01:49:35.679 --> 01:49:36.870 align:start position:0%
we've recently filed lawsuits against
google

01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
google
 
01:49:39.669 --> 01:49:39.679 align:start position:0%
lawsuits against facebook these are
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
efforts where
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
all the resources of the ag's office
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the country have
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
pooled together their resources from
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
their consumer protection division in
 
01:49:49.589 --> 01:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
order to look at the practices of
 
01:49:49.599 --> 01:49:50.470 align:start position:0%
order to look at the practices of
companies

01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0%
that you know are so big that no
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
individual state would be able to to
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
look at them on their own and
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
become a force to be reckoned with to
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
try to protect not only new hampshire's
 
01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
consumers but consumers throughout the
 
01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:01.990 align:start position:0%
consumers but consumers throughout the
country

01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
from both consumer protection and
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
antitrust violations
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
so a few other of the the functions that
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
this bureau undertakes
 
01:50:13.589 --> 01:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
um we have a tobacco enforcement
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
division i won't get into the the nitty
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
gritty of this
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
but the the long and short of it is that
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
based on a settlement agreement with the
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
major tobacco companies many many years
 
01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:23.589 align:start position:0%
major tobacco companies many many years
ago

01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
the state receives a substantial amount
 
01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
of money every year from tobacco
 
01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:28.550 align:start position:0%
of money every year from tobacco
companies

01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
we work to enforce their participation
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
provide money to the states that's
 
01:50:42.149 --> 01:50:42.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to be used to mitigate the
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
impact that
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
smoking and tobacco products has had um
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
on the public in general in all
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
states that join this agreement so we
 
01:50:50.239 --> 01:50:51.350 align:start position:0%
states that join this agreement so we
are

01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
working with various different
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of tobacco products
 
01:50:56.070 --> 01:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the country
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
to protect and make sure that new
 
01:50:59.430 --> 01:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire receives the compensation that
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
is due
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
under this agreement which is i believe
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
is over 40 million dollars last year
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
and you know is around that much every
 
01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:09.109 align:start position:0%
and you know is around that much every
year

01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's our tobacco enforcement unit
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
there's an elder abuse and financial
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
exploitation unit
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
which is something i'm very proud of
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
that was the position that i held before
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
i took the role
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
of bureau chief here it's a purely
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
criminal unit
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
that is 100 dedicated to the
 
01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:26.470 align:start position:0%
that is 100 dedicated to the
investigation

01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
and prosecution of those who take
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
advantage of the elderly in the state of
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
and jeff spill from the bureau of
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
securities regulation i heard him talk
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
briefly about
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
um some of the conduct that is
 
01:51:38.639 --> 01:51:39.669 align:start position:0%
um some of the conduct that is
investigated

01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
investigated
 
01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
and scams is a big part of it but some
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the other work that we do
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
in really the majority of the work that
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
we do in the elder exploitation world is
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
people that are put in a position of
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
trust a fiduciary capacity like a
 
01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:53.189 align:start position:0%
trust a fiduciary capacity like a
trustee

01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
trustee
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
a guardian or a power of attorney for an
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
elderly person
 
01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
and violate that trust in order to take
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
advantage and steal from an elderly
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
person deprive them of their
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
life savings we take those cases very
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
very seriously and there are numerous
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
people that are
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
currently incarcerated at the state
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
prison just for doing exactly that
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
so we have one attorney and one victim
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
advocate that are entirely dedicated to
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
that work
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
and so the consumer protection act also
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
as you'll see in legislation that will
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
inevitably come forward this year
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
it also links up with various other
 
01:52:27.199 --> 01:52:28.390 align:start position:0%
it also links up with various other
statutes

01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
all throughout the new hampshire rsas
 
01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:31.750 align:start position:0%
all throughout the new hampshire rsas
and

01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
specifically makes violation of various
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
different statutes
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
a violation of the consumer protection
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
act if it's consumer related
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
a great example of this is the bureau is
 
01:52:42.239 --> 01:52:43.189 align:start position:0%
a great example of this is the bureau is
responsible

01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
for registering and regulating all the
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
health clubs and all the martial arts
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
studios in the state of new hampshire
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
the reason that it's necessary for
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
consumer protection in this area is
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
health clubs and martial arts studios
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
operate on a model where people pay in
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
advance for their services
 
01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
so you can purchase you know a year of a
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
gym membership up front
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
or a year's worth of personal training
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
classes up front
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
but what happens if the gym then
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
disappears six months
 
01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
six months into that you know contract
 
01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:13.750 align:start position:0%
six months into that you know contract
uh

01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
we make sure that gyms that are offering
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
prepaid services martial arts studios
 
01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
that are offering prepaid services
 
01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
they have to register with us they have
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
to disclose their prepaid liability to
 
01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:24.390 align:start position:0%
to disclose their prepaid liability to
us

01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:53:26.709 --> 01:53:26.719 align:start position:0%
and we make sure that they have a bond
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
in place that covers their refund
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
liability in the event
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
that the school closes we have the
 
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
draw on that bond in order to get
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
consumers their money back
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
there's also various other things that
 
01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
they have to disclose to us for the
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
purpose of consumer protection
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
various requirements in their contract
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're fully
 
01:53:47.669 --> 01:53:47.679 align:start position:0%
disclosing to members
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
you know all of their responsibilities
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're not taking
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
advantage of people
 
01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
we regulate all the health clubs in the
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
state and if they fail to register with
 
01:53:57.589 --> 01:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
us it ties back and it's a it's a
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
violation of the consumer protection act
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
so we would have the ability to bring
 
01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
all of those same remedies and penalties
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
that i discussed earlier either symbol
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
civilly or criminally depending on how
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
serious the violation is
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know i've so i've worked very
 
01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
quickly through you know the world of
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
the types of stuff that we cover
 
01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh just give you a few examples of the
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
types of consumer protection work that
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
we generally see in this bureau
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
just to bring it home and then i'm happy
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
to take questions you know
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
far and away the the top complaints
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
that we get through our hotline process
 
01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719 align:start position:0%
and through our complaint process
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
are car dealerships and contractors
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
cardio especially used car dealerships
 
01:54:39.679 --> 01:54:40.470 align:start position:0%
cardio especially used car dealerships
creates

01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
creates
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
enormous potential for the violation of
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
consumer protection laws specifically in
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
representing used cars to be of a
 
01:54:49.199 --> 01:54:49.990 align:start position:0%
representing used cars to be of a
specific

01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
condition or quality when in fact that's
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
not true you know when you go and you
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
buy a new
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
used car you're really dependent to a
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
large extent on the dealership being
 
01:55:00.070 --> 01:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
honest with you
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
and disclosing you know has it been in
 
01:55:04.709 --> 01:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
prior accidents what sort of condition
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
is it in
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
how many miles does it have all those
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
things need to be
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
clearly and plainly disclosed and
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
concealing that information from a
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
consumer lying to a consumer about the
 
01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
condition of a car you know it's it's
 
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
advertised as
 
01:55:22.629 --> 01:55:22.639 align:start position:0%
runs gray will pass inspection consumer
 
01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
drives it off a lot and you know the
 
01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
thing breaks down on the way home and
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
turns out it's nowhere near passing an
 
01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:28.470 align:start position:0%
turns out it's nowhere near passing an
inspection

01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
and nobody's looked at the things so the
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
dealership's saying you know
 
01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
runs great will pass inspection unless
 
01:55:35.669 --> 01:55:35.679 align:start position:0%
they've actually inspected it they've
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
actually looked at it and they can back
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
up that representation
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
that would be a violation of new
 
01:55:42.070 --> 01:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire's consumer protection act as
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
an unfair
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
deceptive statement that was made to the
 
01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:46.629 align:start position:0%
deceptive statement that was made to the
consumer

01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
contractors are i think it's probably 50
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
50. i think we get just as many used car
 
01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
complaints as we get contractor
 
01:55:53.199 --> 01:55:54.310 align:start position:0%
complaints as we get contractor
complaints

01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
and you know contractors in new
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire don't need to be licensed
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
they're not regulated in any capacity
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
other than through the consumer
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
protection bureau and it just creates
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
the potential for an enormous amount of
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
taking money up front either to buy
 
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
materials or prepayments for labor
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
to to do some sort of a construction job
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
the person disappears with the money and
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
the consumer never sees them again
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
and you know we have to toe the line
 
01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:22.070 align:start position:0%
and you know we have to toe the line
between

01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
you we cannot get involved in contract
 
01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:26.149 align:start position:0%
you we cannot get involved in contract
disputes

01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
disputes
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
so a contract dispute specifically by
 
01:56:28.719 --> 01:56:29.189 align:start position:0%
so a contract dispute specifically by
law

01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
is does not rise to the level of a
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act violation there
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
has to be something more
 
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
there has to be something more egregious
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
about the conduct that would make it
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
um something that the attorney general's
 
01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
office would enforce versus you know
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
something that the parties would
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
litigate between themselves in small
 
01:56:46.229 --> 01:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
claims court or
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
in a civil court um so we get a lot of
 
01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
complaints about quality of work you
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
know somebody you know builds a deck
 
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
and then they a year later they're
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
having all sorts of problems with the
 
01:56:55.119 --> 01:56:55.669 align:start position:0%
having all sorts of problems with the
deck

01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
deck
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
because the contractor did subpar work
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's potentially a you know a contract
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
dispute the person didn't do the work to
 
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
the level
 
01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
that you know they were supposed to do a
 
01:57:08.830 --> 01:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
consumer can take that individual to
 
01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:10.470 align:start position:0%
consumer can take that individual to
court

01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
you have a situation where a person pays
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
money for say ten thousand dollars for
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
the deck
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
the same deck you know so the person can
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
go out and buy materials
 
01:57:21.109 --> 01:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
and then the person never shows up never
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
provides a consumer with any materials
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
never gives them any of their money back
 
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's a situation that we see all the
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
time and that is where we can be really
 
01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:31.270 align:start position:0%
time and that is where we can be really
effective

01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
effective
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
because we are able to not only bring
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act violations but
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
we also have general
 
01:57:38.709 --> 01:57:38.719 align:start position:0%
criminal jurisdiction in this bureau and
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
can bring
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
felony theft charges as well as consumer
 
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
protection act violations against those
 
01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:44.310 align:start position:0%
protection act violations against those
individuals

01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
and we're able to get court-ordered
 
01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
restitution as well as significant
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
punitive sanctions such as
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
jail time or fines if appropriate for
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
contractors that are engaged in those
 
01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
sorts of unfair deceptive acts or
 
01:57:56.239 --> 01:57:57.510 align:start position:0%
sorts of unfair deceptive acts or
practices

01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
practices
 
01:57:59.189 --> 01:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
so i feel like i've spoken for a very
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
long time that's a very very high level
 
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
view of the work the bureau does
 
01:58:05.109 --> 01:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
i'm very happy to take any specific
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
questions at this point if they're
 
01:58:06.159 --> 01:58:07.189 align:start position:0%
questions at this point if they're
already

01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
well that was excellent brandon you
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
really did cover all the
 
01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
all the nooks and crannies and i really
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate you
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
making that presentation so we do have a
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
couple of questions we'll start with
 
01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative patoozik uh good morning
 
01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:22.870 align:start position:0%
representative patoozik uh good morning
sir

01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
sir
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
my question is on
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
generic drugs now i've had an issue
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
i used to take a prescription medication
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh which went generic
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
and then uh because well myelin and tiva
 
01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
are the two
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
worst uh generic drug manufacturers
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
that a they raise the price
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
because there is only one generic
 
01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:54.070 align:start position:0%
because there is only one generic
manufacturer

01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
and they control what it is
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh is there any definition
 
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
for a generic drug anywhere in
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure i understand your
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
question is is there a definition
 
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
for a generic drug a generic drug by
 
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.270 align:start position:0%
for a generic drug a generic drug by
definition

01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
is a non-name so when you create a drug
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know you invent a new drug the
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
company that makes it
 
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
has a certain period of exclusivity
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
where they're the only ones that get to
 
01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
sell the drug because they came up with
 
01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
the formula
 
01:59:32.070 --> 01:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
so they're given an opportunity to
 
01:59:34.229 --> 01:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
profit off their ingenuity
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
for a certain period of time and once
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
that period of time lapses
 
01:59:39.510 --> 01:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
other companies can start make using
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
their formula to create what's called
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
generic versions of that drug
 
01:59:45.990 --> 01:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
so it's any drug that is made that is
 
01:59:48.149 --> 01:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
not a name brand drug
 
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
would be a generic drug but i'm not sure
 
01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
if that's the question you're asking me
 
01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
okay part of the part of the question is
 
01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:54.629 align:start position:0%
okay part of the part of the question is
uh

01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
when when it goes generic there might be
 
01:59:57.679 --> 01:59:58.510 align:start position:0%
when when it goes generic there might be
one

01:59:58.510 --> 01:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturer uh in my case it's myelin
 
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so so hey john um the simple
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
answer is just like any any anybody who
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
has a patent
 
02:00:13.510 --> 02:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
when you lose your patent it's free for
 
02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
anybody to make it it doesn't mean that
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
anybody else is going to make it
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
or copy it it just means that they're
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
free to do it so
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the where i don't know
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
where you're going with this maybe you
 
02:00:23.599 --> 02:00:23.910 align:start position:0%
where you're going with this maybe you
can

02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
we can talk offline on this one but uh
 
02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:27.030 align:start position:0%
we can talk offline on this one but uh
but

02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
in general um you know the generic
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
in when when people think about
 
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical is pretty much
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
just think in terms of patents when
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
you're running your when your patent
 
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
runs out
 
02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
anybody can copy what you did anybody
 
02:00:41.189 --> 02:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
could produce the product
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
whether they do it or not is another
 
02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:44.390 align:start position:0%
whether they do it or not is another
subject

02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
subject
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
okay and mylan are subject to
 
02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
one of the the current pending
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
multi-state suits that has been brought
 
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:53.840 align:start position:0%

thank you that would be under the
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
monopoly there were there was more of
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
the terms of the monopoly
 
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
issue right in this price fixing yeah
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%

next
 
02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman um
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
nice uh presentation i i was interested
 
02:01:13.679 --> 02:01:14.070 align:start position:0%
nice uh presentation i i was interested
uh

02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
it was interesting but i uh two
 
02:01:16.719 --> 02:01:17.510 align:start position:0%
it was interesting but i uh two
questions

02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
if i may um number one is
 
02:01:25.109 --> 02:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
contractor disputes
 
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
or you know frauds or whatever if you're
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
a plumber you have to get a license
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
if you're an electrician you have to get
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
a license
 
02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
i would assume that most contractors
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
hire licensed professionals
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
maybe some don't and then you get some
 
02:01:43.350 --> 02:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
quality issues
 
02:01:46.629 --> 02:01:46.639 align:start position:0%
is there any uh is there
 
02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
would it be a good idea to have a
 
02:01:51.510 --> 02:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
general contractor's license or is there
 
02:01:53.189 --> 02:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
some way of
 
02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
of so doing so as to best ensure
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh getting a quality job i mean
 
02:02:00.629 --> 02:02:00.639 align:start position:0%
somebody's always gonna
 
02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
buy the cheapest stuff there and get
 
02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
exactly what they paid for but there is
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
no license is there or
 
02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
is there is no new hampshire does not
 
02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%
have any licensing requirement for
 
02:02:10.639 --> 02:02:11.750 align:start position:0%
have any licensing requirement for
contractors

02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
so is that unusual anybody can become a
 
02:02:14.159 --> 02:02:14.950 align:start position:0%
so is that unusual anybody can become a
contractor

02:02:14.950 --> 02:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
simply by declaring themselves a
 
02:02:18.629 --> 02:02:18.639 align:start position:0%
contractor so representative herbert you
 
02:02:19.589 --> 02:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
are getting into
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
policy here and uh so it's a little
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
awkward to ask
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
the department about a policy uh this
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
policy issue
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
of licensure contractors has been in
 
02:02:32.550 --> 02:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
front of the commerce committee in the
 
02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:33.669 align:start position:0%
front of the commerce committee in the
past

02:02:33.669 --> 02:02:33.679 align:start position:0%
past
 
02:02:35.669 --> 02:02:35.679 align:start position:0%
it's been a while since we've had it um
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
but it has been in the past
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
um and uh and in every time it it did
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
not pass
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
um and i'll and i'll love to talk to you
 
02:02:44.639 --> 02:02:45.589 align:start position:0%
um and i'll and i'll love to talk to you
offline

02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
offline
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
about uh why why it didn't pass
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
but because i i was in the room when it
 
02:02:53.669 --> 02:02:53.679 align:start position:0%
happened so okay
 
02:02:55.350 --> 02:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
but i would say that it is a policy
 
02:02:57.510 --> 02:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
issue so it's awkward to ask him
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
okay so second question i don't think is
 
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
a policy issue maybe it is but uh
 
02:03:06.070 --> 02:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
and that is a real simple one um
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
you ran across a lot of responsibilities
 
02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:09.669 align:start position:0%
you ran across a lot of responsibilities
there

02:03:09.669 --> 02:03:09.679 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
do you have a manpower problem
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
or could you use could you use another
 
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
attorney or two right that's
 
02:03:20.149 --> 02:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
just a uh i know it's it's touchy
 
02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
because we live in a you know an
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
environment where it's very difficult to
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
raise money
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh at times and so that's an issue
 
02:03:32.070 --> 02:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm concerned also with the
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
ability to provide the service
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
at a level that i think my citizens my
 
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
constituents deserve
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
and if you're short a man or two or a
 
02:03:43.350 --> 02:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
woman or two or
 
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh i would be i would be interested in
 
02:03:45.679 --> 02:03:46.470 align:start position:0%
uh i would be i would be interested in
knowing

02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
knowing
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
about that let me answer it this way
 
02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
um we are limited to the work we can do
 
02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
by the resources that we have and we
 
02:03:56.960 --> 02:03:57.990 align:start position:0%
by the resources that we have and we
have

02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
um at this point we have three lawyers
 
02:04:01.599 --> 02:04:01.990 align:start position:0%
um at this point we have three lawyers
that

02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
including myself that do the general
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
consumer protection work we have one
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
full-time and one part-time lawyer
 
02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
that do all of the state's antitrust
 
02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:13.750 align:start position:0%
that do all of the state's antitrust
work

02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:04:15.669 --> 02:04:15.679 align:start position:0%
we have one lawyer doing tobacco we have
 
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
one lawyer doing elder abuse
 
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
we could without question be doing a lot
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
more if we had additional resources
 
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
just one minor technical thing is this
 
02:04:28.550 --> 02:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
something that we would hear from
 
02:04:31.589 --> 02:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
the attorney general himself
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
in other words if it's requested by him
 
02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh that's probably a better he has a
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
better chance of uh
 
02:04:43.990 --> 02:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
getting that help than if uh brandon
 
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
garad is uh even though he's being
 
02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
very honest i can't wait for the a.g to
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
every budget cycle we go through uh the
 
02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
ag's office will
 
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
always have no to the finance committee
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
that they could use use more help and i
 
02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
would say
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
that i pretty much that's in my annual
 
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
event that does occur
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
and then the ag is the one who does
 
02:05:14.069 --> 02:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
request and then it is part of the
 
02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
of their their budget um i look forward
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
to helping him
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
and for us it's actually kind of unusual
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
because different from all the other
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh departments that we regulate which
 
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
are self-funded
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
this is the only one that really is not
 
02:05:27.119 --> 02:05:27.990 align:start position:0%
this is the only one that really is not
self-funded

02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
self-funded
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
however i would say that um they've been
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
doing a wonderful job
 
02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
with some of these class you know not
 
02:05:36.149 --> 02:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
national lawsuits and have been bringing
 
02:05:36.159 --> 02:05:36.709 align:start position:0%
national lawsuits and have been bringing
in

02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
more revenue than ever before um but we
 
02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't call it a revenue we've called
 
02:05:41.199 --> 02:05:41.510 align:start position:0%
wouldn't call it a revenue we've called
it

02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
fines or assessment but but that um you
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
know they are they're doing better
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
and it's been it's been positive but um
 
02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
it is true that
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
that unlike some say so like for
 
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
instance vermont the banking in
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
an insurance department is uh is not uh
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
assessment run it is actually part of
 
02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
but so having said that uh thank you
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
very much brandon it was great
 
02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
and i didn't do it i don't see any more
 
02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
hands oh representative
 
02:06:12.069 --> 02:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
milo has has one more question yeah
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
um uh rental property owners um do you
 
02:06:16.629 --> 02:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
have oversight
 
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
on um uh conditions
 
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
of a property that's being rented by an
 
02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:24.470 align:start position:0%
of a property that's being rented by an
individual

02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
so it depends you know we so this is
 
02:06:29.109 --> 02:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
this ties back to the definition of
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
trade or commerce
 
02:06:32.550 --> 02:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act applies to
 
02:06:34.069 --> 02:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
those that are engaged in trade or
 
02:06:35.189 --> 02:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
commerce in new hampshire
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
so you know and to use an example here
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
to answer your question
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
if you have a landlord whose business it
 
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
is is being a landlord
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
you know owns several properties makes
 
02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
his living off being a landlord
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
and is in any way acting in an unfair or
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
deceptive manner in the course of that
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
business of renting properties
 
02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
yes we would have the ability to
 
02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
investigate and potentially bring
 
02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
an enforcement action if it's you know
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
02:07:04.069 --> 02:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
that has a guest house and rents their
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
guest house out
 
02:07:06.550 --> 02:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
you know just to make a little side
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
money that's probably not considered
 
02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
trader commerce
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
and that's something that would have to
 
02:07:12.629 --> 02:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
be litigated you know individually by
 
02:07:13.589 --> 02:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
the parties
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
but we do get complaints against the
 
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
landlords routinely we look at them
 
02:07:19.589 --> 02:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
i mean unfortunately the most common
 
02:07:21.030 --> 02:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
complaint we get is disputes about
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
security deposits
 
02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:23.679 align:start position:0%
and that's not something that we can get
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
involved and you know that's very
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
specifically you know
 
02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
there's an agreement where you know a
 
02:07:30.629 --> 02:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
person collects a security deposit it
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
will be returned if certain conditions
 
02:07:33.189 --> 02:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
are met
 
02:07:34.870 --> 02:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
and you know there's a disagreement
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
about whether those conditions were met
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
or not
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's a classic example of you know
 
02:07:39.990 --> 02:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
really what they're debating
 
02:07:42.069 --> 02:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
is the contract and who violated the
 
02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
contract and who didn't
 
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
you know that's something that would
 
02:07:46.229 --> 02:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
have to be resolved civilly but for
 
02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
example if a landlord
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
who was engaged in trade or commerce
 
02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
posted an advertisement
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
that represented that his apartments
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
were of a sufficient quality
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
um or that had they had certain
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
amenities that allured
 
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh lured people into signing lease
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
agreements when in fact that was a lie
 
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know they were actually of a lesser
 
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
quality or they didn't have the
 
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
amenities as advertised those would be
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act violations that
 
02:08:11.109 --> 02:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
we could get involved in
 
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much so yeah like
 
02:08:15.750 --> 02:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
any department there but they can't
 
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
talk about any specific cases that are
 
02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
going on
 
02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
but when you take what's happening in
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
peterborough right now because
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
near and dear that time two times over
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
for me and range
 
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
that you mean clearly if you're the
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
landlord's pointing out that these are
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
legitimate properties that you can rent
 
02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know and he's making that promise
 
02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
and then not follow through
 
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
um clearly that that is a potential
 
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
consumer protection violation
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
the only other thing i would want to
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
mention just so everybody get
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
has it in your head is that the consumer

time in front of this committee
 
02:33:48.550 --> 02:33:48.560 align:start position:0%

um what you'll see is banking is a very
 
02:34:00.469 --> 02:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh complex uh industry it's a
 
02:34:02.950 --> 02:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
heavily regulated and for the most part
 
02:34:05.110 --> 02:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
we try to maintain a level playing field
 
02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:05.670 align:start position:0%
we try to maintain a level playing field
between

02:34:05.670 --> 02:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:34:09.750 --> 02:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
the um this state uh
 
02:34:11.910 --> 02:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
state laws and federal laws um and
 
02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
really maintaining uh what's on this
 
02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:14.389 align:start position:0%
really maintaining uh what's on this
parity

02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399 align:start position:0%

02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
um i sent the committee just uh some

02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
of banking um how it's regulated our
 
02:34:41.270 --> 02:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
priority issues
 
02:34:42.630 --> 02:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
and i think really important right now
 
02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
is how the industry has responded to
 
02:34:47.429 --> 02:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
covet helping their communities
 
02:34:49.429 --> 02:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
get through this very difficult economic
 
02:34:49.439 --> 02:34:50.710 align:start position:0%
get through this very difficult economic
time

02:34:50.710 --> 02:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:34:54.150 --> 02:34:54.160 align:start position:0%

into
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%

is scott shire i'm
 
02:35:29.830 --> 02:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
and while i'm promoting you has got
 
02:35:33.429 --> 02:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
representative terry wants to know why
 
02:35:34.469 --> 02:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
he can't get
 
02:35:37.510 --> 02:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
ling ling beer
 
02:35:40.790 --> 02:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
so not that you have to okay
 
02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
answer that question great question
 
02:35:45.830 --> 02:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me actually that is a very
 
02:35:47.910 --> 02:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
specific question with res very
 
02:35:51.030 --> 02:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
with respect to a particular brand
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
but it goes to it goes to the broader
 
02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
question as a new representative
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
of how it is determined that
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
a producer can obtain permission to
 
02:36:03.429 --> 02:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
market in the state of new hampshire
 
02:36:05.670 --> 02:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you yeah well let me let me
 
02:36:07.349 --> 02:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
address that real quickly and we can
 
02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
always have an offline discussion later
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
but basically
 
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
um it's the decision of the supplier or
 
02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
in this case the brewer
 
02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
to come to the state whether they want
 
02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
to they would have to get
 
02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
the appropriate license to bring their
 
02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
product into the state and then as
 
02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
um chairman malika alluded to earlier to
 
02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
go through the three-tier system they
 
02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
would work with
 
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
a wholesaler partner in the middle tier
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
and then bring it to retail
 
02:36:33.590 --> 02:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
obviously in the last few years as you
 
02:36:36.230 --> 02:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
know they've chosen to to move into
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
the state south of our border the great
 
02:36:39.510 --> 02:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
state of massachusetts
 
02:36:41.349 --> 02:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
but they have not decided to come here
 
02:36:43.429 --> 02:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons
 
02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
which i do not know specifically what
 
02:36:46.710 --> 02:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
those reasons are but
 
02:36:48.150 --> 02:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
i know we do get a lot of requests like
 
02:36:51.270 --> 02:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
that for particular products people have
 
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
a great uh deal of pride of origin um as
 
02:36:55.030 --> 02:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who's spent
 
02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
several years of my life living in
 
02:36:58.230 --> 02:36:58.240 align:start position:0%

02:37:03.990 --> 02:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
across the border and grab some and
 
02:37:05.270 --> 02:37:05.280 align:start position:0%

some statistics
 
02:43:42.469 --> 02:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
but a few of the things that i just want
 
02:43:44.550 --> 02:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
to point out very briefly are
 
02:43:46.469 --> 02:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
we work on roadway safety issues with
 
02:43:49.349 --> 02:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
the department of safety and dmv
 
02:43:51.670 --> 02:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
we also work force is a critical issue
 
02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
for us
 
02:43:53.830 --> 02:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh we do a tremendous amount of
 
02:43:55.830 --> 02:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
workforce issues with
 
02:43:58.550 --> 02:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh over 25 high schools and community
 
02:43:58.560 --> 02:43:59.510 align:start position:0%
uh over 25 high schools and community
colleges

02:43:59.510 --> 02:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
02:44:02.790 --> 02:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
um for both front end and back end jobs
 
02:44:05.990 --> 02:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh in our industry whether it's sales
 
02:44:06.790 --> 02:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
and finance
 
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
or the service department and we're very
 
02:44:10.389 --> 02:44:10.399 align:start position:0%
proud of over the past
 
02:44:13.030 --> 02:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
few years we've given away over four
 
02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in scholarships
 
02:44:18.230 --> 02:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
to students to get their careers and
 
02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
educated sessions started
 
02:44:22.550 --> 02:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh be it to pay for community colleges
 
02:44:23.670 --> 02:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
or tools
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
um in the service department so
 
02:44:27.750 --> 02:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
workforce again a critical issue
 
02:44:30.389 --> 02:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
um for us in our industry um and then
 
02:44:32.070 --> 02:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
lastly what i'd like to point out
 
02:44:34.630 --> 02:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
um and there'll be some contact and some
 
02:44:35.910 --> 02:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
information on the handout that i'll
 
02:44:36.630 --> 02:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
send to you
 
02:44:39.510 --> 02:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
is our auto cap program and auto cap is
 
02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
the automotive
 
02:44:43.429 --> 02:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
consumer action panel it's a panel that
 
02:44:44.230 --> 02:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
we run
 
02:44:47.670 --> 02:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh to help uh consumer disputes uh it'll
 
02:44:49.830 --> 02:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
be very helpful for your constituents
 
02:44:51.990 --> 02:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh the attorney general's office as
 
02:44:52.950 --> 02:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
brandon mentioned
 
02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
earlier today i know they refer about
 
02:44:56.630 --> 02:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
200 calls to us
 
02:44:59.510 --> 02:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
that most often it's a misunderstanding
 
02:45:01.590 --> 02:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
the sales manager didn't know what
 
02:45:03.510 --> 02:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
a salesman told a customer or the
 
02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
customer didn't know what tires for life
 
02:45:08.950 --> 02:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
really meant so just by engaging them in
 
02:45:10.469 --> 02:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
communication we find that we can
 
02:45:12.870 --> 02:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
resolve a number of disputes
 
02:45:14.389 --> 02:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
if the consumer's not happy they still
 
02:45:15.910 --> 02:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
have the ability to go to small claims
 
02:45:17.910 --> 02:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
court through the court system
 
02:45:20.230 --> 02:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
the the the member the dealer the
 
02:45:21.269 --> 02:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
decision of this
 
02:45:23.670 --> 02:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh independent arbitration panel it's
 
02:45:24.710 --> 02:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
binding on them
 
02:45:26.790 --> 02:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
and if they don't follow it we have and
 
02:45:28.389 --> 02:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
we can and we we will

not screw up like i didn't forget not
 
02:57:27.269 --> 02:57:27.279 align:start position:0%
know that senate commerce was being
 
02:57:29.269 --> 02:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
monday where i should have been tuning
 
02:57:30.469 --> 02:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
in to watch
 
02:57:32.950 --> 02:57:32.960 align:start position:0%

uh amazing phenomena that i guess that
 
02:57:44.070 --> 02:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
was one of the positives
 
02:57:46.469 --> 02:57:46.479 align:start position:0%
from this covet is that we now have this
 
02:57:46.479 --> 02:57:47.190 align:start position:0%
from this covet is that we now have this
technology
