highways and
 
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
um I guess I do have a question as as
 
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
far as I knew in the past anybody that
 
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
attended the
 
00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 align:start position:0%
meeting as part of the committee was
 
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
able to vote
 
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll allow anyone to uh make
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
statements ask questions uh there the
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
there won't be a vote we will simply
 
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
report what we find back to the full
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
committee at at the work session on
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
Tuesday okay thank you the purpose of
 
00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee is to go carefully
 
00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
through the lapse extension portion of
 
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill 25 to make sure that it is
 
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.469 align:start position:0%
House Bill 25 to make sure that it is
absolutely

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
accurate if we fail to lapse extend an
 
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation it will lapse on June on
 
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of June and the agency then
 
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
technically wouldn't be able to pay a
 
00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
bill for that project that came in later
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
so it's critical that we identify every
 
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh lapse extension that needs to be made
 
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
conversely if there's a project that is
 
00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
going to be done by June 30th and all
 
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
the bills are paid the agency will be
 
00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
able to identify that for us and we'll
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
be able to reuse that money on some
 
00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
other project I have done a a hand go
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
through of all the uh materials that
 
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
were provided ahead of time and I see
 
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
very little money that uh that that
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
would apply to uh
 
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
so if there's no questions on what I've
 
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
said uh we can start we with the with uh
 
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
our first agency is going to be
 
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
administrative services and that starts
 
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh if you're looking at the laps
 
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
extension worksheet it's on page one uh
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
item number one if you're look you can
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
also follow along on House Bill 25 and
 
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
it's item number one in the laps
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
extension section so as we go to the
 
00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 align:start position:0%
agencies I will uh call out where we are
 
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
so if seeing no questions uh
 
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner Arling house I I do have
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
one comment uh you didn't uh provide
 
00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
anything ahead of time have you cross
 
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
checked uh to make sure if we go if we
 
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
reference through House Bill 25 uh
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's not a methodology that will
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
identify anything that's
 
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
missing are we confident that you don't
 
00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 align:start position:0%
have any item that needs to be extended
 
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's missing yes um uh we did that
 
00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
okay great so we were um we're as
 
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
worried as you are um last thing we need
 
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
to have is Karen get halfway through a
 
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
building and go hey there's no money for
 
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
the windows um and we are pretty sure
 
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
that there
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
are let me rephrase that we know there's
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
nothing missing um what I'd like to do
 
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 align:start position:0%

quite a few projects that were delayed
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
due to the p mic um so there are there
 
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.000 align:start position:0%

nothing for a lot of months while people
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
were you know understandably very skit
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
about where the budget and revenues and

all of that uh was going and um Karen
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
and her team were very frustrated on
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
occasion because I wanted to get out
 
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
there doing stuff and we were we were on

removal so these boilers were part of
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
the conquered steam conversion project
 
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
the boilers have been removed and most
 
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
of the infrastructure has been removed
 
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
we'd like to use the remaining funds to
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
pave the areas where the temper boilers
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
were to restore the property back to its
 
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
original condition and that will happen
 
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.949 align:start position:0%
original condition and that will happen
this

00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%

00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
the structurally deficient conquered
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
steam building um I don't know if
 
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
anyone's had a chance to drive by lately
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
but that I I drove by yesterday the
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
stack is um coming down it's the last
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
piece that of the the existing building
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
to come down um phase one will be
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
wrapping up here in the next month or so
 
00:11:16.829 --> 00:11:16.839 align:start position:0%
and we'd like to use the remaining funds
 
00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:19.959 align:start position:0%
for phase two which will be to stabilize
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
the property um that remains so there's
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
a big
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
um uh drop off there um where you know
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
going down to where the building used to
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
be and we need to make sure that we make
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
that safe for the remaining uh tenants
 
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
that are on the
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
campus uh item number 11 is for
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
emergency backup generators for the new
 
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
boilers that were installed as part of
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
the conquered steam conversion project
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
um that project is set to wrap up in
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
September um and there's a couple
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
there's two other projects further down
 
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
that tie in with this project so I just
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
want to point that out and I'll mention
 
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
it again when we get
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
there um um item number 12 is annex One
 
00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%

the Annex Building on the State Office
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
Park South uh the design is um in
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
progress currently and we we will be
 
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
bidding that out as soon as the design
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
work is done so that has an undetermined
 
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.629 align:start position:0%
work is done so that has an undetermined
completion

00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
date um item 13 uh this is one of the

projects that relates the general Ator
 
00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
so this is relocating and upgrading an
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
electrical service which is
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
current um and uh instead of upgrading
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
the service and then having to move it
 
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
when we installed the generator we
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
decided to wait and um do the two
 
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
projects together so again that one will
 
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
be completed in the
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%

the same campus related to again the
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
conquered steam conversion and the
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
associated generators that's for the
 
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240 align:start position:0%

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
started I'm going to skip over
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
the IT project here and move on to item
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
number 22 which is for the bankra
 
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.949 align:start position:0%
number 22 which is for the bankra
building

00:14:49.949 --> 00:14:49.959 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
stabilization uh that project uh design
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
has been completed and construction to
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
shortly

00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
shortly
 
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
item number 23 is another one of our
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
emergency fund
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
um this one was the emergency fund
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
appropriated in
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
2017 there's about
 
00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:14.759 align:start position:0%
174,000 remaining of the original
 
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
$500,000 appropriation this is the
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
emergency fund that we've been using to
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
offset the lapsed money for the
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
conquered steam conversion project um I
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
think we talked in the original capital
 
00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
budget hearing earlier this year about
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
the $2 million that was appropriated
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
part of the appropriation for the
 
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
conquered steam conversion project that
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
lapsed um two years ago and we found
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
several other uh funding resources
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
within the division and Department to
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
help offset that um the funding that we
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
were not able to
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
um to
 
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
regain um item number 2 oh that's an IT
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
project skip that one for
 
00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
now so we're on item number 25 which is
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
um a roofing project for Spalding and
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
that one has not yet started but will be
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
soon item number 26 is
 
00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
um a bundle of funding for security
 
00:16:27.309 --> 00:16:27.319 align:start position:0%
upgrades at state-owned buildings so
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
this is another fund that we've been
 
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
using using on an as needed basis to
 
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
upgrade things like alarm systems um
 
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
door security card reader systems and
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
other things to help ensure that our
 
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
buildings are
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
secure um item 27 is a similar project
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh designated uh specifically for the
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services building at 29
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
Haven and again we've been using that on
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
an as-needed basis and currently we're
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
um installing cameras additional card
 
00:17:01.949 --> 00:17:01.959 align:start position:0%
readers um for security over there as
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
part of the uh pandemic um preparation
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
and ongoing uh security
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
needs item number
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
28 um is for the State library parit and
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
ceiling pair uh this project is
 
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
virtually completed but we've recently
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
discovered an issue that we're doing
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
some investigative work on and so we'd
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
like to retain the remaining 53,000 to
 
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
funding item number 29 um
 
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
is is the um one of the original
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for the conquer steam
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
conversion project um we intend to use
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
the remainder of this funding it's
 
00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:47.559 align:start position:0%
currently encumbered um and will be used
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
to complete the remaining punch list
 
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
items for the conquered steam conversion
 
00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
project which should be finishing up
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.760 align:start position:0%

to covid and um we'll be beginning as
 
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
soon as the weather gets nice again and
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
we can do Roofing
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
projects um item 31 is um another ada8
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
access this is on the backside of the
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
main building it's currently under under
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
construction um most of the fun has been
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
encumbered there's a small amount
 
00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:32.919 align:start position:0%
remaining and that construction is
 
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
ongoing to be completed sometime in this
 
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.270 align:start position:0%

appropriated in 17 um the courthouse is

essentially completed an operational but
 
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:08.919 align:start position:0%
we'd like to retain the small amount of
 
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
funds remaining to complete some final
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
items I'm going to skip over item number
 
00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
34 and number
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
35 and I'm going to move on to item
 
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
number 36 which is again our 2015
 
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation for emergency funds
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
there's about $70,000 remaining in that
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
um original appropriation um which we
 
00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
intend to use for a back flow backflow
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
preventor project on the New Hampshire
 
00:19:40.149 --> 00:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
Hospital campus this summer when we can
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
get into the ground again and do that uh
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
replacement work we did a temporary fix
 
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
earlier in the year um just to get us
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
through um but we do have intentions to
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
use that remainder of that funding to
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
project um on item number 37
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
um which is again another
 
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide appropriation that we use on
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
an as-needed basis this is for Burglar
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
Alarm Replacements so again in addition
 
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
to the other two
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
security Appropriations we continue to
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
use this on an as-needed
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
basis number 38 is for um upgrades and
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
repairs at the State House and the upam
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
Walker building which again is
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
predominantly spent but we have a few
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
small projects still outstanding that we
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
were are in the process of
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
completing item number 39 is oh that's
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
another IT project and um item finally
 
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.669 align:start position:0%
another IT project and um item finally
item

00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
40 um which was originally for the main
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
building Bakery which has since been
 
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
torn down um we intend to use the rest
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
of this funding to again pave the um
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
back section of the main building where
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
we're currently constructing the Ada
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
access um and it would become a parking
 
00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
lot with Ada accessible parking
 
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
um and we're we're tying this in with
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
the paving project that will also um
 
00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%
pave over where the temporary boiler
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure previously
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
was I think I hit on all of them and I
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
know I did it rather quickly um and I
 
00:21:14.669 --> 00:21:14.679 align:start position:0%
have a couple spreadsheets and Pages
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
open here trying to make sure I didn't
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
lose track of anything but please feel
 
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
free to jump in with questions and I'm
 
00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
also happy to talk about the projects
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
that are completed um and the funding
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
that will
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
purp um so that I realized that that
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
funding um was originally appropriated
 
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
in 2009 which is well before I was in
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
this role um I think the I don't even
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
speak to what the intent was at the time
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure but um since then
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
that portion of the building was torn
 
00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:57.559 align:start position:0%
down and work to restore the backside of
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
main building so that safe and usable
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
space so I might defer to someone who
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
knows a little bit more or I can find
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
out if we need to change the purpose of
 
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
that well if is the area that we're
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
Paving adjacent to where the bakery was
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
yes it's actually right on top of where
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
the bakery okay I I would defer to uh to
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
the LBA but it sounds like we're all
 
00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
is and so why don't we go over to the
 
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.230 align:start position:0%
is and so why don't we go over to the
commissioner

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
to handle the IT projects I'll go
 
00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:33.799 align:start position:0%
through the IT projects relatively
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
quickly I I think it's it's fairly easy
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
there are two uh two projects that are
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
labeled Erp sustainability Erp is the
 
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
enterprise resource planning it means
 
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
and it's our it's the state enterprise
 
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
system the computer system um every year
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a smaller
 
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation for this in the coming
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
bium there's a there's an appropriation
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
for migration of the cloud and and the
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
most upgrade this project is to deal
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
with continual upgrades and improvements
 
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:08.919 align:start position:0%
for example uh the one was creating the
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
Strategic sourcing module and the
 
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
contract management mod
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
module um and then uh working on wfm
 
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
which is a which is a the timekeeping
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
portion of it um and and some
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
interfaces um a lot of that work was
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
suspended during the uh during the
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic um for example strategic
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
sourcing we got you know probably a year
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
ago March well a year ago um we were in
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
a in a great place um and then we
 
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
stopped because everybody working on it
 
00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
has been working literally for the last
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
year on on pandemic stuff particularly
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the procurement shop which is where
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's been LED what it means is
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
there's there's more money there than
 
00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh than there should be so both of
 
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
those have remaining balances but both
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
of it is simply because the work hasn't
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
been done the work will be done over the
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
next year and two pieces of it anyway
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the um the project
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's on your 21 list as the cloud
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
project um which is uh much more than
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
just going to the cloud but is actually
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
the the next generation of the
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
system um so that money is is uh used
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
for that as well um to make sure we're
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
not going to um redo the work so both of
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
those are we still
 
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.350 align:start position:0%
those are we still
need

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's a scheduling
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
project the Erp scheduling SCH software
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
was a uh was a project that um started
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
and stopped again in 2017 and 201
 
00:24:48.029 --> 00:24:48.039 align:start position:0%
18 um because of a bad vendor a
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
difficult relationship with a vendor I
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
don't know if I'm allowed to say bad
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
vendor um which we uh which we
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
sidetracked and then is up and running
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
but um Corrections is where that started
 
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
started um that's likely to go live um
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
at the end of this month um and then the
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
next two phases which are also um 2477
 
00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
scheduling bits I believe our safety and
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
then I know safety is two I think New
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital is three but don't
 
00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799 align:start position:0%
hold me to that but um um that money
 
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
will support that that project which
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
we're actually very optimistic about um
 
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
and then the the the third thing is the
 
00:25:27.149 --> 00:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
the one that has about $300,000 left in
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
it which
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
project that actually dates back to
 
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
2011 um this is probably the last time
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
you're going to see this um we actually
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
anticipated using that this year um the
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
department has not uh been allocated it
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
money in the state operating budget
 
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
because we have this it project left
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
over from when the when the phase two of
 
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
the original ARP was implemented the H
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
side of it um the HR and payroll side of
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
it if you will um the idea was to
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
upgrade our our system we hads then and
 
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
the idea was to upgrade them we did
 
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
upgrade some we still have a lot of old
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
computers now we have something like 21
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
units don't hold me to that number
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
because that's probably give or take 10
 
00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:16.039 align:start position:0%
that are um at least five years old and
 
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
doit has us on a fouryear build
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
back um we had a computer purchase
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
scheduled for April a year ago and we
 
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
didn't do it because when we were
 
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
stopping doing things like building
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
stuff and fixing the treads on the
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
stairway at the department of safety
 
00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
building for example um I decided that
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
we weren't going to buy new computers
 
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
and so but now we're gonna buy new
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
computers but we didn't before and we we
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
probably won't uh spend that before the
 
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
end of the fiscal year but we'll spend
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
it before the end of the calendar
 
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
year that's
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
Department seeing none the bottom line
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
is we have 40 Projects they should uh uh
 
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
let's see Mr
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
Shay uh repres Jack I think you would
 
00:27:10.389 --> 00:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
want um Karen to go through the projects
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
they've completed there's any laps
 
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
available that you could
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
repurpose okay uh because there are
 
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:19.240 align:start position:0%
projects that aren't listed on the laps
 
00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
extension that they worked on through
 
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
this bium that they may have some
 
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.029 align:start position:0%
this bium that they may have some
leftover

00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
leftover
 
00:27:30.029 --> 00:27:30.039 align:start position:0%
funds all right why don't we do
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
that sure if I may I have a a list here
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
of projects that are
 
00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.909 align:start position:0%
of projects that are
complete

00:27:38.909 --> 00:27:38.919 align:start position:0%
complete
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
um starting
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
with um an appropriation from
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
2017 um for Statewide energy projects um
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
that money has been fully spent so there
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
is no lapse
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
there I have an appropriation from
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
2017 for a roof replacement at the
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
department of safety there is $ 75,4 196
 
00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:11.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
appropriation I have a project
 
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.600 align:start position:0%

$26,670
 
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
79,2 190 remaining um there was a a
 
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
request to um use that money for
 
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
something I believe um that was in
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
legislation last year and I don't think
 
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
that it through the process I don't know
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
where that stands at this point in time
 
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
um but that money is currently still um
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
account that's it that's it good one to
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
end on that's a good one to
 
00:30:27.149 --> 00:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
end yeah I think we're all happy that
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
the conquered cour house project
 
00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.269 align:start position:0%
the conquered cour house project
completed

00:30:30.269 --> 00:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
completed
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
successfully yes it's a beautiful
 
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
building it really
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
is for those who weren't on the
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee at the time uh we used a
 
00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:41.799 align:start position:0%
private contractor to build the building
 
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
and then sell it to the county which is
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
not the way we normally do building
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
projects and it was kind of
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
controversial at the time uh and it was
 
00:30:52.509 --> 00:30:52.519 align:start position:0%
a little bit risky because they were
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
building it right next to the existing
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
Courthouse while they trying to have
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
court so that's the background on that
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh I see a question from representative
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
Mills uh yes thank you Mr chair uh I've
 
00:31:11.629 --> 00:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
been going through my paperwork and
 
00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
trying to keep up with countless emails
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
we've got on all this do we have any uh
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
written record of all these lapses that
 
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
we have money coming back from and if so
 
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
where do we have it yeah I was just
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
going to ask that if we could get
 
00:31:30.669 --> 00:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
uh if we're going to be able to reuse
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
this we need you know a massive amount
 
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
of text uh to put into house B25 for the
 
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
repurpose uh and we don't and uh uh
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
let's see Mr Shay apparently knows
 
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you R Sam Jack now that
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
the Department's identified which
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
projects they're completed with I have I
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
can get the information in terms of the
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
value of each of those projects and put
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
together the language you would need to
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
repurpose okay that would be
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
great and I'd be happy to send that list
 
00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519 align:start position:0%
over because that's a substantial amount
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that is a substantial amount of
 
00:32:09.789 --> 00:32:09.799 align:start position:0%
money particularly in the in the marac
 
00:32:12.629 --> 00:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
county courthouse very very pleasant
 
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:15.559 align:start position:0%
also Mr chair I noticed in past years
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
we're used to dealing with maybe
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
getting maybe two $300,000 left over for
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
projects and this this seemed to be a
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
very uh nice boost in the revenue
 
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:32.710 align:start position:0%
very uh nice boost in the revenue
side

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
so I see no further
 
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
questions uh anything uh anything else
 
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
the department wants to
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
add um thanks thanks for having us and
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
if you have any other questions as you
 
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
go on we're um we're always available
 
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
and happy to be here all right well we
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you for doing such a
 
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:54.919 align:start position:0%
nice job and the bottom line is we have
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
40 out of 40 Projects that should be
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
continued and we have money left over uh
 
00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
and we'll get the list on
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
that thank you thanks have a great day
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
let's see if we and because we've
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
noticed the meeting the way we have we
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
are able to continue with the next
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
agency which is uh
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
Transportation I do not see the
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner yet but that doesn't mean
 
00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.149 align:start position:0%
commissioner yet but that doesn't mean
that

00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
we uh can someone from Transportation
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
say who's going to
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
present yes representative um Chris was
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
Tru Deputy Commissioner I was going to
 
00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
present this information with Mar Mullen
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
um and she she's not on as of yet she's
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
coming on now wonderful there she is it
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
takes a few seconds when we do it for it
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
actually to transfer
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
over so that's why there can be a little
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
bit do you want uh Patrick Hurley
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
on or anyone else no um Bill Cass is
 
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
with us as well he's he's the assistant
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner all right let me just tell
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
everyone where we are we're on the
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh that's on worksheet
 
00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
page 12 starting at item
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
155 and by my
 
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
calculation uh all of their projects
 
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
should uh there's no project that that
 
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
can be lack at this time from the ones
 
00:34:33.069 --> 00:34:33.079 align:start position:0%
that are listed so with that uh we'll
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
recognize the we'll recognize Mr
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
was uh to go
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
ahead and thank you representative and
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
members of uh house public works
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for the record Chris
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
waschuk um the Deputy Commissioner of
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
the department um so um I believe Marie
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
sent um an 11-page document and she's
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
sharing the screen right now with the
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
description of I believe there's roughly
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
25 or 30 or so projects um that date
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
back several
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
bienniums um that were awarded Capital
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
that were approved with capital Bud F so
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
I I will I will go through this fairly
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
quickly I'll I'll pause after each item
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
if if that is okay for any questions um
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
and then we can move on um I will say at
 
00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:28.599 align:start position:0%
the start a lot of um most of projects
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
were impacted by covid you know frankly
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
when covid happened last spring um we we
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
took a pause on some of the capital work
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
because of because of the the state of
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
the highway fund revenue and our concern
 
00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:46.839 align:start position:0%
that the revenues coming in um would
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
potentially impact our ability to
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
progress some of these because as as you
 
00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.670 align:start position:0%
progress some of these because as as you
know

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
um majority of these projects are
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
matched with with um Highway fund um
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
there are a few that I'll I'll talk
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
about that are General
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
funded majority are Highway funded so
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
the first one here um
 
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
and it's 14 um
 
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
.155 it is it is in in essence the 5%
 
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
match for the um Federal um Aviation
 
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
program really as as we talk last
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um although the initial
 
00:36:34.349 --> 00:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
appropriation is shown at 77.6 million
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
that is the total funding which includes
 
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
the federal and state and I believe the
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
local portion uh this program um in
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
essence is funded with 90% FAA funds uh
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
for airport improvements 5% share is is
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
funded with the state general fund and
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
then 5% um is a local share you know
 
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:01.720 align:start position:0%
a lot a lot of this program hinges with
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
um faas Regional and National priorities
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
um although there were probably some
 
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:10.839 align:start position:0%
some delays relative to to covid I think
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
the majority of the delays were you know
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
had to do with um faa's priorities in in
 
00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:21.319 align:start position:0%
moving various projects forward um
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
typically um when funding is available
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
um you know to let me let me refr phrase
 
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
that typically it takes about 6 to 8
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
years from the time that this um capital
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
budget item is approved to fully expend
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
the funds I mean that's that's just the
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
nature of the program so we're
 
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
requesting a lapse extension until June
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
2026 um the general fund appropriation
 
00:37:52.589 --> 00:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
was actually 4.1 million uh the
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
remaining balance at this time is 3.5
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
million um
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
and are there any questions relative to
 
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.829 align:start position:0%
and are there any questions relative to
this

00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
none yeah please proceed okay thank you
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
the next item um is also uh a general
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
funded item this this is um State a
 
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
1337 it was actually $1 million that was
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
allocated were approved for uh railroad
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
Bridges um that are on
 
00:38:38.309 --> 00:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
um active active Rail lines um in
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
essence this funding was frozen again
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
due to co impacts on Revenue um as you
 
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
know the department has over 100 over
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
160 state-owned Bridges railroad bridges
 
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
on just the active lines um and these
 
00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
bridges are inspected annually um
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
that a common has identified over 20
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
structures that are listed as a category
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
CI and that is a category in the
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
inspection program that Identify some
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
sort of defect or repair that will be
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
needed within approximately one year so
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
in essence um we are still moving
 
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
um we're requesting we we feel we can
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
expend These funds by June of 2022 so
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're requesting an extension until that
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
time any questions on this item yeah
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead I I'll let you know if
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
there's a question absolutely okay um
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
the next the next item uh item 133
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
accounting unit um
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
1338 these were this is actually um an
 
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation 900,000 for a private rail
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
line uh the project completion date in
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
an AUD AUST um based on a
 
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
G&amp;C um item is uh August of 2022 so by
 
00:40:08.349 --> 00:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
that time we feel that this this work
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
would be completed so the extension is
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
2022 next
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
item this is also um a similar private
 
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
rail line request um this actually is a
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
request for the stra and County uh and
 
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
cow county rail improvements $900,000
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation similar based on um a GNC
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
item um the feeling is that this one
 
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:40.839 align:start position:0%
here will be uh completed by August of
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
2021 so we request an extension until
 
00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:48.390 align:start position:0%
2021 so we request an extension until
that

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
time now please uh please
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh let's go unless I see a question uh
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
let's just move from one to the next
 
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely next item is um matching
 
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
funds for federal the federal uh Transit
 
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
program uh these are these are 10%
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
matching funds um the appropriation was
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
97,000 uh typically um it requires at
 
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
least 18 months to secure vehicles um
 
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
this is to leverage 80% federal funds um
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
it utilizes 10% local funds and then uh
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
the 7,000 was a 10% match for that for
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
that effort um right now uh because of
 
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
because of some delays because of covid
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
we're expecting that we would need an
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
2023 next
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
item um this this is a Highway funded
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
item this was accounting unit
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
1344 it was for State equipment it was a
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
10 million um appropriation
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
we have roughly 2.6 million left um we
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
did freeze um any kind of purchases last
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
last year so we do expect um to utilize
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
These funds so we're requesting an
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
2023 the next item the Manchester Patrol
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
shed another Highway funded item 2.1
 
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
million was appropriated for the design
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
and construction C of this um as we
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
talked about uh this item last last
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um additional million dollars
 
00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
of appropriation will be necessary uh to
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
be able to fully fund this item this
 
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
this project was bid last spring um the
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
bids were open and they were much higher
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
than the
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation so in essence we need um a
 
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
lapse extension as well as there was
 
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:57.640 align:start position:0%
discussion about needing another million
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
for this item and we have that noted on
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
a separate
 
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
page the next item is uh also a highway
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
funded item D Bryant
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
system this is actually well underway we
 
00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
did pause it a little bit because of the
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
covid um issue but we are moving forward
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
and we feel that this item will be fully
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
extended by October this year so so
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
we're requesting an lapse extension
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:38.559 align:start position:0%
2021 the next item um Statewide Life
 
00:43:38.559 --> 00:43:39.430 align:start position:0%
2021 the next item um Statewide Life

Code improvements $4.1
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
million um this was also put on pause
 
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
because of covid um we feel we need an
 
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
lapse extension until uh December of
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
2022 to be able to fully progress on
 
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
this item and address um fire the State
 
00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:02.359 align:start position:0%

locations the next item uh is 1.8
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
million for Statewide salt
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
sheds as we talked about this is this is
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
an annual item that um is appropriated
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
to address the worst of uh Statewide
 
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
salt sheds that we have due to co again
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
we put uh halt on some of the design and
 
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
construction work locations in mil and
 
00:44:33.549 --> 00:44:33.559 align:start position:0%
dixville are moving forward um with this
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
item and we feel this work can be
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
completed by June of 2022 so we're
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%

Edition similarly uh due to co we kind
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
of took a pause um we feel that um this
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
item can be can be completed by December
 
00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.990 align:start position:0%

$450,000 as we discussed last Wednesday
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
in order to fully fund and complete this
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
work based on updated
 
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
estimates the next item is a state

several several uh projects that we are
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
moving forward with uh to be able to
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
utilize this appropriation and we feel
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
that U by December of

so we need an extension till that
 
00:45:58.589 --> 00:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
time I apologize my phone is ringing ex
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%

million was appropriated for for that
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
item um right now we're working with
 
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
theit and there's substantial changes
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
going on for various systems um with a
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
Works um in place there were some minor
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
delays early last year with the
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
cancellation of travel and such but this
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
this uh project is moving forward and
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
the apartment request um an extension
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
until June of
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
item the next
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
item Statewide equipment purchases This
 
00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
was um an appropriation in just year
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
19 there there is
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
$214,000 that was appropriated I believe
 
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
it was a transfer from other items that
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
lapsed funds so we request an extension
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
till June of 2023 to be able to F fully
 
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
funds the next item is similar to uh an
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
item that we I spoke of earlier um it's
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
really for the FAA program um
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
80% federal funds 10% uh State matching
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
funds um this item um again in order to
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh fully utilize the funds that
 
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
typically take 6 to8 years so we're
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
2022 the next item um is a general
 
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
funded item it was uh $500,000
 
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation to repair archers in
 
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
walpool uh these archers were large
 
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
Granite um historic Arch culets that has
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
some flood damage and undermining uh
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
because of covid and different different
 
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
issues with permitting and and getting
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
uh work started out here um we're
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
requesting that this be extended until
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
December of this year in in order to
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
address um those issues this work is
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
being done inh house um but we feel that
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
we can complete this work by December of
 
00:49:13.549 --> 00:49:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
item this is an airport Improvement
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
project uh for the easn slope railroad
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me Eastern Slope Regional
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
Airport 75,000 appropriation this
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
airport is located in Fry uh fryberg
 
00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh it's kind of complicated from a
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
funding standpoint it does have this
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
general fund uh capital budget
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation and then it recently
 
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
received Grant funds from FAA the main
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
do USDA and so on so the department
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
plans to make a one-time payment once
 
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
the project is done and project
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
completion is scheduled for um July of
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
2023 so we we feel that we can expend it
 
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.349 align:start position:0%
2023 so we we feel that we can expend it
by

00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:49:59.950 --> 00:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
that June of 2023
 
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
date um next project is the lisman
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
project it's a patrol shed project This
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
Is A Highway funded project um this is
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
just about fully complete however there
 
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
was a last minute change during
 
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
construction that required um handicap
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
access so this extension out to February
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
of 22 will address that and and utilize
 
00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.950 align:start position:0%
of 22 will address that and and utilize
the

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
Remain the next project is the
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
underground tank replacement program
 
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
um 1 million was appropriated back in
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
2017 uh for this item there is roughly
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
325,000 remaining again due to covid and
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
other issues we feel that
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
um we need an extension out until
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
December of 2022 to fully uh be able to
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh expend the the these These funds uh
 
00:50:51.119 --> 00:50:51.910 align:start position:0%
uh expend the the these These funds uh
we

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
have two projects that are currently um
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
waiting to to be bid and once they go to
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
construction probably use some of these
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
funds the next item is um a salt shed
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
program 1.7 million at that time was
 
00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate in 2017 we have 161,000
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
remaining um again we feel an extension
 
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
out until November of 22 is necessary to
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
fully expend These
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
funds the next item Manchester Patrol
 
00:51:26.829 --> 00:51:26.839 align:start position:0%
shed uh this is an item that was o
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
discussed last Wednesday this is
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
actually for $300,000 for design um we
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
are going to this was bid last spring we
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
are going to rebid so we need these
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
funds to uh be able to do some file
 
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
design work to address Fire Marshall uh
 
00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
comments as well as get the project
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
ready to be rebid so we feel that uh in
 
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:51.640 align:start position:0%
August extension up to August of 20 22
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
is necessary um for this
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
item um xville Patrol
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
shed this is another item where um 1.4
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
million was appropriated an additional
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
700,000 is needed this this project is
 
00:52:10.589 --> 00:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
actually bid twice and put on hold um on
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
both loc both um instances due to covid
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
as well as increased
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
costs uh this so
 
00:52:23.309 --> 00:52:23.319 align:start position:0%
this additional uh this this work in
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
essence is is anticipative completed by
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
November of
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
22 um so it laps an extension out until
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
that time is necessary to continue uh
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
project and with that I'm going to turn
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
it over to Marie to um talk through um
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
the final remaining projects Marie
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
morning uh members of the committee so
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
um some of these projects here are going
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
to be a little more repetitive um uh
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
because they we have multiple items so
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
again here is our from 2015 is our FAA
 
00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:05.559 align:start position:0%
program U of the amount appropriated um
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing above here is is the
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
federal and state funds uh but down here
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
we have the general fund initially
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
appropriated was about 3.6 million we
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
still about 1.6 million remaining um for
 
00:53:21.549 --> 00:53:21.559 align:start position:0%
match for the federal FAA program again
 
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
that's uh the state's share of that is a
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
5% match so we'd like to bring that
 
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.190 align:start position:0%
5% match so we'd like to bring that
forward

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
the next item are are some funds for
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
railroad Bridges uh we have a small
 
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
balance remaining of 122,000 as Chris
 
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
stated before uh we have approximately
 
00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
21 in that C1 condition so we'd like to
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
um you know we plan to continue to
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
utilize These funds to work on those
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
railroad Bridges and um bring them back
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
condition then next item is line 180 in
 
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
hb25 um these are public transit funds
 
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh for the the match for the bus program
 
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
so this is the state's 10% match um
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
there there is a balance remaining here
 
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
that we would like to continue to
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
utilize um for the uh 11 public transit
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
agencies to provide the state's 10%
 
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
match on bus purchases um moving
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
forward the underground fuel tank
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
replacement again this is additional
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
funds as part of that program so there's
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
about 49,000 remaining plus some
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
encumbered funds that we'd like to bring
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
forward to continue to utilize um and be
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
able to put out as many projects as we
 
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
can on this underground fuel tank
 
00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.069 align:start position:0%
can on this underground fuel tank
replacement

00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
program next item is the oversized
 
00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:51.799 align:start position:0%
overweight permit software um this
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
project went out to RFP has been
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
implemented and there are some uh
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
additional funds here 200,000 for um
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
annual maintenance and hosting costs um
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
those should be um utilized and
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
completed by August of 2022 so we'd like
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
to bring that forward to ensure that
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
those funds will be utilized on that
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
intended the next item is Line 183 in
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
hb25 and that is uh related to the
 
00:55:22.079 --> 00:55:23.230 align:start position:0%
hb25 and that is uh related to the
welcome

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
centers uh these funds were initially
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
appropriated at 760,000 there's still a
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
$242,000 balance remaining um we've had
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
to put on hold some of the
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
repairs um Rel at several of the the
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
sites due to um turnover of personel at
 
00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
both do and Bea um and then of course
 
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
covid with the funding issues um the
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
intent is to utilize the majority of
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
these funds on the Littleton site
 
00:55:59.470 --> 00:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
restrooms and uh then um the subs the
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
remaining funds would be used for
 
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
additional repairs at several of the
 
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
state line 184 is the 5% match again for
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
the FAA program um with this one there
 
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
of this amount there was 1.6 nearly 1.7
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
million of General funds appropriated uh
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
the remaining balance is
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
96,000 um again as Chris mentioned some
 
00:56:26.829 --> 00:56:26.839 align:start position:0%
of these projects can take six to years
 
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:29.559 align:start position:0%
to complete so we'd like to um bring
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
forward the balance here to be able to
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
complete those FAA
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
projects line 185 um is railroad
 
00:56:41.029 --> 00:56:41.039 align:start position:0%
acquisition right of first refusal so uh
 
00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
185 and 186 are both similar um in state
 
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
law it requires us to be able to um have
 
00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
the first right of refusal for rail
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
properties and uh airport properties
 
00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
within 90 days of them of them being
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
offered to the state so these funds are
 
00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:00.039 align:start position:0%
needed to be able to be brought forward
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can meet that 90day
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
requirement um otherwise you know the if
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
we didn't have these available you know
 
00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
we don't have this in the operating
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
budget it wouldn't be available and we
 
00:57:12.029 --> 00:57:12.039 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to meet that 90-day
 
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
requirement so we we'd like to continue
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
forward and then page nine are just some
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
footnotes uh page 10 uh these are the
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
three projects with um laps funds that
 
00:57:29.789 --> 00:57:29.799 align:start position:0%
are available so as you can see so you
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
know not a lot of money here um but $57
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
related to general fund and then these
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
two a little over 11,000 related to
 
00:57:40.589 --> 00:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
Highway fund projects uh we do have a
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
few other projects that were lapsing but
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
they have been fully expended so these
 
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
were the only ones that had uh funding
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
remaining now if we can go back to the
 
00:57:52.029 --> 00:57:52.039 align:start position:0%
previous slide I'd like to just explain
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
something the the one before that okay
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh if you take a look for example at uh
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
line 184 the 5% match the reason why you
 
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
have the same projects coming back and
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
back and back this particular one was
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
first appropriated in 2013 and then it
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
would have been extended in 2015 and 17
 
00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
and 19 and you'll have another
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation in in 15 that was that was
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
extended in 17 and 19 and we have one in
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
in this year so they pull all that money
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
together and we simply use the money
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
until it's fully expended so that's why
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
in case anyone is confused by that
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's why you see the same item come
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
back several
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
times that's correct thank you
 
00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:39.190 align:start position:0%
times that's correct thank you
representative

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
Jack uh so our last slide I believe you
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
saw on Wednesday but I'll turn it over
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
to Chris um if there's any questions on
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
that or if we want to revisit that
 
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
all so so representative so this this
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
slide was shown on Wednesday so the
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
there are three previously appropriated
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
items that um as we noted on Wednesday
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
they require additional funds um
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
primarily because um they were either
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
bid last spring and costs came in much
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
higher and with the Bureau of Public
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
Works really evaluating the cost today
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
they feel that the cost 10 to 20% higher
 
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
than they were even last spring so uh
 
00:59:26.349 --> 00:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
like for example Manchester an
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
additional million dollars is needed uh
 
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
for that project for the Lancaster
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
district office an additional 450,000 is
 
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
needed for that item and the dixville um
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
patrol Shar an additional 700,000 is
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
needed for that item which total is 2.15
 
00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
million we also noted that um the fuel
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
management system that is currently in
 
00:59:53.069 --> 00:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
our current budget request we feel um a
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
million doll reduction to that 5 million
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
initial appropriation um would be would
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
be adequate so the net change really um
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this is a decision
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
before this committee or the entire
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
Public Works committee um an additional
 
01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
1.15 million is needed yeah well that
 
01:00:17.029 --> 01:00:17.039 align:start position:0%
part I can answer uh this this committee
 
01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
will simply report back what it finds
 
01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:20.839 align:start position:0%
it's up to the full committee to make a
 
01:00:20.839 --> 01:00:21.789 align:start position:0%
it's up to the full committee to make a
final

01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:21.799 align:start position:0%
final
 
01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
disposition uh according to whatever it
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
wishes to do
 
01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative and I see representative
 
01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:32.039 align:start position:0%
Mills has a
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chair uh I I
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
agree that this this request should go
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
in front of the entire committee not the
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
laps committee but I did want to bring
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
up while we have people here um to Mr
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
Shay I believe we've already seen uh
 
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
you've crafted an amendment to hb25
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
regarding this is that correct sir that
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
is correct repm Mills and I just uh
 
01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
shared it with repm Graham and he asked
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
all the committee at it and it was based
 
01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
on the idea that um I brought up at the
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
presentation the other day of creating a
 
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
new appropriation in House Bill 25 for
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
these three projects and reducing um as
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
showing as shown here on the sheet the
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
million dollars from the fuel management
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
system replacement project that's in the
 
01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.349 align:start position:0%
system replacement project that's in the
2223

01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
2223
 
01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
you so I see no further
 
01:01:42.029 --> 01:01:42.039 align:start position:0%
questions uh was there anything else you
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
you wanted to
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
cover that that's that's all we have
 
01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.789 align:start position:0%
cover that that's that's all we have
Representatives

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
um so the bottom is we have 32 uh
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
extensions and they stay in there and we
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
have the the one item to make additional
 
01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
Appropriations uh that was on that last
 
01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.109 align:start position:0%
Appropriations uh that was on that last
slide

01:02:08.109 --> 01:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
slide
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
correct so that uh if there's nothing
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
further that you want to say uh I guess
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
we can move on let me see thank you I
 
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:21.160 align:start position:0%

on uh DHHS and if they can tell me if
 
01:02:56.269 --> 01:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
they want to proceed now they're not not
 
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
scheduled until 10:30 so if Lori Weaver
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
can tell
 
01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
on if she wants to go
 
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:12.839 align:start position:0%
now representative Jack yeah when I this
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
is Chris when I reached out to the I let
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
them know that this was a a flowing time
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
in the there was a tentative time that
 
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
they would be scheduled but potentially
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
you'd be going 15 20 minutes earlier
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
than that so I think most agencies
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
yeah well the thing is I yeah I mean at
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
some point I want to fill in with the

responses uh if we have a if we have a
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
break in between at some
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%

gold at continuing to um to as I said
 
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
earlier enhance the the new heights

approval was in 2015 we completed that
 
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
project and and um there's no remaining
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
funds so that was completed in March of
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
actually and then the the bridges

modernization project so this initial
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
project uh was the first phase of
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
basically moving from our Legacy 23 plus
 
01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
plus year old system and into the the
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
into a comprehensive child welfare

of a six-year um project um there was
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
some delays in the project overall but
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
we completed that work last May and then
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
we we're continuing you'll see later on

families Division and and that will be
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
continuing over the next several years
 
01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.669 align:start position:0%
continuing over the next several years
as

01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
well and then the DHHS email
 
01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
project this project was to implement
 
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
the Microsoft Office exchange it was the
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%

email system system and that that
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
project was completed and we are um we
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
are recommending two laps the
 
01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:39.669 align:start position:0%
are recommending two laps the
$5,784

01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
18487 and then moving on to our division

taking our paper process and and doing
 
01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
an Imaging process to make those make
 
01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
all our actual
 
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
manual processing of paper available in
 
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
the system electronically to alleviate
 
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
um the the casew workers having to drive
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
back to the office to get information
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
they were able to actually access that
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
information while they're out supporting
 
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.750 align:start position:0%
information while they're out supporting
their

01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
clients that that project was completed
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
in March 2019 and continues to be
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
supported in our in our class 27
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
operations and then moving on to our in
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
progress capital projects um these are
 
01:17:31.629 --> 01:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
projects that we're we going to request
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
that they would not be lapsed so that we
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
can continue the efforts and it we'll be
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
I'll be passing it back to Dave clap
 
01:17:40.629 --> 01:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
this next one I'm going to have to uh
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
interrupt you before everyone to tell
 
01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:50.600 align:start position:0%

been going on and uh is near completion
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
we did Identify some additional areas
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
that needed um additional coverage and
 
01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
that's why we're asking to have this uh
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
lapse extended uh for this project
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
um and we are expecting it to be
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:26.430 align:start position:0%
 
year

01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%

completed phase one and our on uh
 
01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
working on phase two which is later in
 
01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:52.750 align:start position:0%
working on phase two which is later in
the

01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:52.760 align:start position:0%

01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
projects combined um because they are
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%

to uh be maintained and not to wander
 
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
around and uh get lost plus there was a
 
01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
lot of uh upgrades within the building
 
01:19:56.629 --> 01:19:56.639 align:start position:0%
to allow for the monitoring and um

17719 that we have other identified
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
other areas that we are going to uh
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
address that weren't addressed during
 
01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%

our repairs are been going on an ongoing

basis as has been allowed by covid uh
 
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
some areas we have discovered uh with
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
another project that we're in need of
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
being addressed so we're expecting to
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
have this complete by September of this
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
year um and right now there's an unced
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
balance of
 
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
12,839 62 which will be fully expended
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:01.960 align:start position:0%

Fire Road uh we have addressed it it has
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh been pretty going along pretty well
 
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
it was affected by covid uh deliveries
 
01:21:24.669 --> 01:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
of material and um Workforce were for
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
the uh contractor were affected because
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
of uh the
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
covid-19 we're expecting to have this
 
01:21:37.149 --> 01:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
85 85 of the Glen Cliffe Lam Martin Wing
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
window replacement uh has gone very well
 
01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
we have identified additional windows
 
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
that we had not included in the original
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
portion because of uh fear of not having
 
01:21:58.910 --> 01:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
enough funding for them uh the funding
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
is there to allow us to complete the
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
project and get that out of uh done by
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
November of this year um delivery on
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
these is take some time because they are
 
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
customade and um the ones that we have
 
01:22:18.669 --> 01:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
96 that's you Dave
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
yep I I saw you breathing so um Again
 
01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
David weers so the New Hampshire
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
electronic health records um project was
 
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
a was basically part of our critical
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
Cloud migration and so we we originally
 
01:22:41.709 --> 01:22:41.719 align:start position:0%
had electronic medical record system on
 
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
premise in our doit data center and as
 
01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
part of of a migration for disaster
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
recovery and failover capacity and in
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
remediation of the Legacy equipment we
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
allocated These funds to do that cloud
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
regation and it's anticipated for
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
completion in November 30th 2021 this
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
this this calendar year it has an
 
01:23:07.629 --> 01:23:07.639 align:start position:0%
unencumbered balance of
 
01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
35455 90 which is a associated with the
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
work this is
 
01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
94 the New Hampshire APS Security and
 
01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.149 align:start position:0%
94 the New Hampshire APS Security and
safety

01:23:25.149 --> 01:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
grades um this particular one is a joint
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
project between facilities and it and my
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it should be
 
01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
completed this December of 2021 and it's
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
meant to basically do the renovations of
 
01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
the lobby and entrance of the acute
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric Services building Dave did
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
you have other items on this one no
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's um there was a couple of items
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
that were identified that needed to be
 
01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
addressed and uh they have been included
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.149 --> 01:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
89 I think that's one you Dave oh
 
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
yes hure Hospital roof replacement um
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
the roof has been replaced we have found
 
01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
that we are getting uh additional storm
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
water infiltration into it we are in the
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
process of getting that addressed and
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
expect to have this project complete by
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
December of this year right now the
 
01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
unencumbered balance is
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
38445 U the additional work we don't
 
01:24:37.229 --> 01:24:37.239 align:start position:0%
believe will leave any uh addition funds
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
complete this is
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
90 enan for Hospital chill is an
 
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
Associated component replacement the
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
main focus of this was the chillers and
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
associated components they have been
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
installed and up and running there is
 
01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
additional work that needs we have found
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done to allow us to
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
ensure the uh longevity of the equipment
 
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
we expect that to be complete by May of
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
next year uh the unencumbered balance at
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
91 this one's M New Hampshire electronic
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
health record Pharmacy and scanning
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
module again as we we continue to
 
01:25:43.629 --> 01:25:43.639 align:start position:0%
enhance the functionality of that um
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record system we are
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
we are planning to have that module
 
01:25:51.109 --> 01:25:51.119 align:start position:0%
complete by November of this coming of
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
this year November 30th 2021 as a result
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
of of other um critical priorities um
 
01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
impacting the the division um we had a
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
delay on the implementation however it
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
was due to Resource constraints as well
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
as covid-19 pandemic impacts but we are
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
anticipating to have that completed by
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
November the unincumbered balance on
 
01:26:24.270 --> 01:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
new hampire hospital renovation of
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
existing space this is to allow us to
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
complete the renovations of the pharmacy
 
01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.510 align:start position:0%
complete the renovations of the pharmacy
and

01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
um psychological areas of the facility
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
um some of this was held up because of
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
covid restrictions and uh Trying to
 
01:26:49.629 --> 01:26:49.639 align:start position:0%
minimize the exposure of clients to um
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
non um DHHS staff there is an cumbered
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
balance at 28
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
55328 and we expect all of that if not
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
all of it pretty close to all of that to
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
be um expended by the time the project
 
01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:08.750 align:start position:0%
be um expended by the time the project
is

01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:11.719 align:start position:0%
complete this is
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
83 New Hampshire hospital air handling
 
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
system upgrades this
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
was truly affected quite uh heavily by
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
covid uh we couldn't do a lot of the
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
work that was
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
required uh because of requiring us to
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
have proper air ventilation and so forth
 
01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
so we do have an the project is as you
 
01:27:39.149 --> 01:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
can see almost fully expended the money
 
01:27:39.159 --> 01:27:40.229 align:start position:0%
can see almost fully expended the money
is

01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
encumbered um but it has not been
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
expended and we do not expect it to be
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
year this is
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
78 Glen Cliff Home Electrical enhan uh
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
system enhancement as most people know
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
the Glen Cliff is a standalone system up
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
there and we are have been working on
 
01:28:09.310 --> 01:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
this to get going forward the project
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
has been bid it is in the process of
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
going to GNC for a uh to be awarded um
 
01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
so all the funds will be expended um by
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
the completion which you expect to be
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:31.870 --> 01:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
year this is
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
77 Glen Cliff home portable water system
 
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
phase two this ties into the previous
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
one which was phase one uh this was
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
adding um additional water capacity and
 
01:28:48.669 --> 01:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
getting us off of a SST that Dees does
 
01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
not like us to use we the project is
 
01:28:57.550 --> 01:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
pretty much designed at 90% and work has
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
begun uh work stopped last year because
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
of frost but we were impacted by um
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
covid where they couldn't get enough uh
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
workers to get the work
 
01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
completed um
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
the there is will be a project the going
 
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
to GNC for approval and all the funds
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
will be expected expended at that time
 
01:29:27.149 --> 01:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
year this is
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
84 the automated inline mailing system
 
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
is what we call the as machine it
 
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
handles the mail bulk mailing for the
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
whole department uh we have had a uh the
 
01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
project is going well uh we do have some
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
additional programming that needs to be
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh done the scope has been defied and
 
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
we're awaiting uh Bureau of Information
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
Services approval on the uh programming
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
and the vendor to get it
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
complete the there is an unencumbered
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
balance at this time at
 
01:30:12.189 --> 01:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
13555 um we will expect that to be fully
 
01:30:14.590 --> 01:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
expended when this is complete which is
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
year this is
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
95 so the new heights incremental
 
01:30:26.189 --> 01:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
mization project as you as you can see
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
the new height system is a very complex
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
system that we have had several capital
 
01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
projects and we will continue to as we
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
continue to provide integrated
 
01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility this this phase two of the
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
incremental renewal of new heights
 
01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:42.280 align:start position:0%
allowed us to move from an older
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
technology of cobalt programming to a
 
01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
newer Java technology and that project
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
is on track to complete in September of
 
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
this year of this year and it has an
 
01:30:55.709 --> 01:30:55.719 align:start position:0%
unincumbered balance of
 
01:30:55.719 --> 01:30:57.629 align:start position:0%
unincumbered balance of
$449,500

01:30:57.629 --> 01:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
$449,500
 
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
29 that would be anticipated to um be be
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
um expended by the by that completion
 
01:31:10.270 --> 01:31:10.280 align:start position:0%
date this project also is um go at
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
getting us off of um dependent on Legacy
 
01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
IBM software which will reduce our cost
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
our operational cost going
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
forward this is
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
97 uh replay platform of options
 
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
application the options application also
 
01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
are known as our elderly adult care
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
system that that project was um
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
initially approved in 2011 based off
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
some organizational changes and how that
 
01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
that Bureau interacts with Medicaid um
 
01:31:47.709 --> 01:31:47.719 align:start position:0%
we had to change from change directions
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
and we're actually waiting on the the
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
comprehensive child welfare information
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
system to build the build out the
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
platform on Salesforce so we can
 
01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
leverage that platform going forward and
 
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
reduce our our overall long-term costs
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
of that system the unencumber balance of
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
of the appropriation is the full amount
 
01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
$722,500 the estimated a completion date
 
01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
based off of its integration with our
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
other um comprehensive Child Care
 
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
welfare information um system is June of
 
01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.990 align:start position:0%
welfare information um system is June of
2023

01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:32:30.189 --> 01:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
76 and leading into the comprehensive
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
child welfare information system this
 
01:32:37.149 --> 01:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
this project was the the second phase of
 
01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
a multi-year project this project was in
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
intended on building the intake and the
 
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
assessment tools of the Child Welfare
 
01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
information system where where people
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
our case workers will be able to intake
 
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
information from reports and then assess
 
01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
those those reports and then and then
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
integrate in with our current Legacy
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
system for case management and
 
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
Reporting this project is anticipated to
 
01:33:06.030 --> 01:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
be completed by September
 
01:33:11.070 --> 01:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
2023 and the unincumbered balance of 7,9
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
24352 as a direct result of the vendor
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
um the contract with the vendor
 
01:33:18.109 --> 01:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
indicates that they would not be paid
 
01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
until they actually complete the work um
 
01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
however they have done a lot of work on
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
the project to constitute components of
 
01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
this payment and so we would anticipate
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
that full amount to be expended upon
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
2023 this is
 
01:33:39.229 --> 01:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
79 the the Medicaid management
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
information system or commonly known as
 
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
mismis technical stack upgrade was the
 
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
first component of a long a five-year
 
01:33:50.669 --> 01:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
program to implement the changes
 
01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:54.280 align:start position:0%
necessary to com to maintain that system
 
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
was focused on the Legacy Hardware that
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
was originally acquired in
 
01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
2007 and replacing that Hardware so that
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
we could not only have a supported
 
01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
system but also maintain Federal
 
01:34:10.510 --> 01:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
certification which um is directly
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
related to our federal funding match for
 
01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
that system the anticipated completion
 
01:34:18.109 --> 01:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
date for that project is August of
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
20121 the current unencumbered balance
 
01:34:20.639 --> 01:34:22.709 align:start position:0%
20121 the current unencumbered balance
is

01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
$322,700 which would be anticipated to
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
80 so the the Bureau of Developmental
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
Services um it remediation plan this
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
project is focused on the the Legacy
 
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
system that is uh supporting
 
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
developmental services and there's a
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
typo at the top it's actually the Bureau
 
01:34:55.709 --> 01:34:55.719 align:start position:0%
of Developmental services so the a would
 
01:34:58.750 --> 01:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
need to be removed um that um Bas is a
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
different um Bureau within Behavioral
 
01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.910 align:start position:0%
different um Bureau within Behavioral
Health

01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
specifically um this project was
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
basically intended to take that system
 
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
and integrate in with the new heights as
 
01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
well as the Medicaid management
 
01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
information system and REM remove us
 
01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
from uh access database and Excel
 
01:35:21.390 --> 01:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets into um tools that are not
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
man that are not creating manual
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
processes and potential data data
 
01:35:27.790 --> 01:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
integrity and accuracy issues this
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
project is um in progress and is set to
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
complete in June 2023 and it's tied to
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
other capital projects that are being
 
01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
submitted and and reviewed by the
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
committee for for future work as well
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
the UN encumbered balance of
 
01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.910 align:start position:0%
the UN encumbered balance of
3,579

01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
3,579
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
777 would be anticipated to be expended
 
01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:52.629 align:start position:0%
777 would be anticipated to be expended
upon

01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.639 --> 01:35:54.709 align:start position:0%
 
completion

01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
completion
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
82 and the new heights and New Hampshire
 
01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
easy Gateway
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
monitorization that that Gateway is
 
01:36:05.229 --> 01:36:05.239 align:start position:0%
basically the the integration component
 
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
of where our clients interface with our
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
our call center and how our call center
 
01:36:13.709 --> 01:36:13.719 align:start position:0%
and case managers interface with the
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
clients so it's it's key um automation
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
for that comp those components to ensure
 
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
that the the case workers and the people
 
01:36:25.149 --> 01:36:25.159 align:start position:0%
the call takers as well as the clients
 
01:36:26.669 --> 01:36:26.679 align:start position:0%
are getting timely information
 
01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
associated with their their requests and
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
verification of their
 
01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility this this pro project is in
 
01:36:37.709 --> 01:36:37.719 align:start position:0%
progress um this is one of the projects
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
that was um delayed specifically due to
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 pandemic as we took the
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
resources that were working on this
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
project and had to reallocate them to
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
look at the eligibility impacts um to
 
01:36:53.709 --> 01:36:53.719 align:start position:0%
our citizens to ensure that as as things
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
changed to ensure that they had access
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
to the system the systems and services
 
01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
that they needed they anticipate
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
completion um date of this project is
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
September 30th 2021 and the unencumbered
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
balance is
 
01:37:07.679 --> 01:37:10.550 align:start position:0%
balance is
386,000

01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
386,000
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
$262.50 and would be expected to be
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.030 --> 01:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
completion and that is our last slide so
 
01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
I'll hand it back to Deputy Commissioner
 
01:37:24.990 --> 01:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
sh Lori
 
01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
Weaver thank you so that is what we have
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
process so bottom line I see no
 
01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
questions bottom line is we have 22
 
01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
projects they all match to House Bill 25
 
01:37:45.550 --> 01:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
albe it in a radically different order
 
01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh this is a great example of why having
 
01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:48.790 align:start position:0%
uh this is a great example of why having
a

01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
presentation uh in advance is helpful
 
01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
because uh I was able to uh correlate
 
01:37:57.950 --> 01:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
them to House Bill 25 which I wouldn't
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
have been able to do if we didn't have
 
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
it so if there's ever a lesson in that
 
01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
this is it uh and then we have so we
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
have 22 projects they're all in House
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 25 we have $335,000 Plus in
 
01:38:14.709 --> 01:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
completed projects and uh I see no
 
01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:16.360 align:start position:0%
questions there anything else that the
 
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
department wishes to
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
say thank you we thank you for coming
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:38:26.910 --> 01:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
great day let's see so we have I have
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
on so Dees is the next agency and if I
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
can get my mouse to
 
01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
work uh this is starting on page
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
five at item
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:02.350 --> 01:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
to or there's a missing line is what it
 
01:39:05.229 --> 01:39:05.239 align:start position:0%
is again this was is another case where
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
it was really helpful to have the
 
01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:25.629 --> 01:39:25.639 align:start position:0%
bring so Mr Scott is there anyone else
 
01:39:27.229 --> 01:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
that you would like to have on the call
 
01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
and we're running a little early so uh
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else you'd like to have
 
01:39:34.990 --> 01:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
on the call yes uh Sue Carlson our chief
 
01:39:37.709 --> 01:39:37.719 align:start position:0%
operating officer
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
okay just a second it does it takes a
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
second to move someone so they don't
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
show up for a few seconds there she
 
01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
is's I can close the shade a little bit
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
if it's too if you can't see me no
 
01:39:54.189 --> 01:39:54.199 align:start position:0%
that's fine um when we come to it
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh there is a
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
mistake there's a missing line in House
 
01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:02.070 align:start position:0%
mistake there's a missing line in House
Bill

01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
25 so
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh we can get to that when when the time
 
01:40:10.669 --> 01:40:10.679 align:start position:0%
comes did you want to share the
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
presentation up on the screen or or how
 
01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
did you want to do this we weren't
 
01:40:16.149 --> 01:40:16.159 align:start position:0%
playing on that I just want to ensure
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
that all the the committee subcommittee
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
members uh have have a copy of what we
 
01:40:23.470 --> 01:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
provided is is that the case uh they
 
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
probably do but if you have it available
 
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
to share that would be good
 
01:40:35.550 --> 01:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:40.510 --> 01:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
do uh commissioner Scott this is cret I
 
01:40:44.910 --> 01:40:44.920 align:start position:0%

commissioner with the Department of
 
01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services uh I've asked as
 
01:41:17.589 --> 01:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
as you could as you know our chief
 
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
operating officer Susan Carlson we do
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
have following if need to bring them on
 
01:41:24.669 --> 01:41:24.679 align:start position:0%
some of our staff members uh if there
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
are questions also so we should
 
01:41:27.589 --> 01:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll be able to answer any
 
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
questions you have uh as you see on the
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
screen and hopefully you have uh Sue
 
01:41:36.030 --> 01:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
Carlson provided a nice memo on our uh
 
01:41:39.149 --> 01:41:39.159 align:start position:0%
the lapses that are uh indicated uh laps
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
extension requests excuse me that are uh
 
01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
indicated in House Bill
 
01:41:47.070 --> 01:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
25 uh I do want to make sure at the end
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
of our memo uh that we do have a request
 
01:41:52.189 --> 01:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
to repurpose so I want to make sure I I
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to that that uh so I
 
01:41:57.870 --> 01:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
I can walk through the memo uh if that's
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
the chair would like or questions I
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
don't know how press for time you are
 
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
and that type of thing oh we're we're
 
01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
running early we have plenty of time so
 
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
if you could walk through it that would
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
be great okay so uh pressing on well
 
01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
obviously you're uh you where we
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
identified is the the the the sections
 
01:42:17.709 --> 01:42:17.719 align:start position:0%
of the lines and house the the house
 
01:42:21.629 --> 01:42:21.639 align:start position:0%
bill 25 that are uh in the lap section
 
01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
of of that so uh the first section we're
 
01:42:26.589 --> 01:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
talking about is as you see is our
 
01:42:29.790 --> 01:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste uh match uh as you're
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
likely aware uh Appropriations are
 
01:42:35.229 --> 01:42:35.239 align:start position:0%
currently being used for to cover our
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
the state's obligation for 10 the the
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
10% match from the state for uh superf
 
01:42:44.430 --> 01:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
fund sites that the state has now uh
 
01:42:47.310 --> 01:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
moved into the state's uh perview uh the
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
two we're talking in this case are NRA
 
01:42:51.629 --> 01:42:51.639 align:start position:0%
plating and miramac and the
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
Savage uh well in Milford uh again uh
 
01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
takes a 90% share but we're required to
 
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
match uh
 
01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
10% uh
 
01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
and that's what that first uh section is
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
on our hazers waste match uh and and if
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
you can scroll down Chris so the the
 
01:43:19.589 --> 01:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
next section is is uh again similar in
 
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
that it's matched for federal monies is
 
01:43:24.910 --> 01:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
our drinking water revolving Loan Fund
 
01:43:28.589 --> 01:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
so that requires a 20% match uh to the
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
federal part of our capitalization Grant
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh and again there's uh two major
 
01:43:37.390 --> 01:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
components uh loans for infrastructure
 
01:43:39.390 --> 01:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
projects in the set as size which are
 
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
the earmarks for things like
 
01:43:43.589 --> 01:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
Administration and and the technical
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
assistance and program management that
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
are are listed in the the
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
memo uh so given the the time lag
 
01:43:54.669 --> 01:43:54.679 align:start position:0%
between the Monies uh being obligated
 
01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
and these uh projects to be fully
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
completed uh that drives a need for a
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
lapse extension okay so this is where
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
the mistake is uh the reference to 65 is
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
a mistake 65 is a clean water
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation right so we need to add a
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
line uh referencing 228 call one uh
 
01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:20.629 align:start position:0%
line uh referencing 228 call one uh
roman8

01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
roman8
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
B uh repres Jack yes this is Chris yeah
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
um Sue emailed me this morning and I
 
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
just haven't had a chance to send it
 
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
forward but um that project is complete
 
01:44:35.470 --> 01:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
the uh 228 colon one oh okay Roman 8B
 
01:44:37.589 --> 01:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just a typo okay so that
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
means that this reference to section 65
 
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
should just simply not be on this and
 
01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
there's no additional fund there's no
 
01:44:47.310 --> 01:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
additional drinking water funds from
 
01:44:51.149 --> 01:44:51.159 align:start position:0%
17 yeah and I apologize for that I
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
mistakes happen there and I forgot to
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
take it off yeah mistakes happen as long
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
as we catch them it's not an
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
issue and to be fair to sue Carlson she
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
told me to mention it too but I didn't
 
01:45:04.830 --> 01:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
get that far yet so thank you
 
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh so uh moving on so the next
 
01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
section Chris uh is for the Clean Water
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh srf uh and again
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
just cont intuitive to some people
 
01:45:18.430 --> 01:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
obviously drinking water is water we
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
drink clean water is is waste water and
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
storm water that type thing so this just
 
01:45:26.350 --> 01:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
a term of art that the federal
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
government uses uh so this is very
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
similar in that we have a 20% match
 
01:45:35.070 --> 01:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
requirement uh to be uh I I mentioned
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
the timeline lag required to get these
 
01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
projects done for Wastewater projects uh
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
the time uh lag is even more these are
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
more complex projects that take even
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
more uh time to get from uh design all
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
the way through to uh operational uh so
 
01:45:55.470 --> 01:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh the need and the reason
 
01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
for for uh those numbers and again
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
obviously any questions you have please
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
interrupt me uh so moving if moving down
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
if there's no questions on
 
01:46:09.390 --> 01:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
that uh the next um multiple sections
 
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
all have to do with our our dam
 
01:46:15.070 --> 01:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
obligations uh for dams obligations for
 
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
dams I have to be careful how we say
 
01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
that I suppose um and uh again this this
 
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
section 59 is for Dam repairs and
 
01:46:25.709 --> 01:46:25.719 align:start position:0%
reconstruction ruction uh we have
 
01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
summary uh you know between covid and
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%
and other uh similar delays uh we do
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
expect to be able to obligate as as seen
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
on the next page August is there thank
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
you Chris uh the uh the next nine months
 
01:46:42.270 --> 01:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
we should be able to obligate the rest
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
of the balance uh what we're looking at
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
particularly is reconstruction of uh the
 
01:46:50.910 --> 01:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
weeks pond dam in Warren uh and the H
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
Reservoir Dam in in Harrisville so
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
that's the you know again we we need
 
01:46:58.109 --> 01:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
that to lapse uh in order to meet that
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
obligation but that shouldn't take too
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
long beyond that um so moving to item 60
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
here which is our operational uh
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
facility so
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh beg my uh Indulgence for a m beg your
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
indulgent for a moment so our existing
 
01:47:19.470 --> 01:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
facility is uh first of all it's very
 
01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
old and and has many structural problems
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
but second of all it's in a flood plane
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
so this is the facility where we would
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
stage our equipment uh and be able to
 
01:47:31.390 --> 01:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
grab it in case of an emergency among
 
01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
other things and a lot of the damn work
 
01:47:35.589 --> 01:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
we do uh having it in the flood plan is
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
probably not a great idea in my opinion
 
01:47:40.510 --> 01:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh for things you need to do during a
 
01:47:43.149 --> 01:47:43.159 align:start position:0%
flood uh but any case uh there's a lot
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
of reasons why that needed to be
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
upgraded so uh that we are uh out forbid
 
01:47:52.030 --> 01:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh right now and we expect to to be at
 
01:47:54.109 --> 01:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
the governor and counc for approval for
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
the contract for that construction in
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
April uh and we hope to have the the uh
 
01:48:01.629 --> 01:48:01.639 align:start position:0%
the building uh in place uh in
 
01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
operational uh within a year so uh
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's the those two items are are for
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
that uh Lake op Dam uh we've had a
 
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
fairly successful uh bium uh getting
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
that damn I was going to say replacement
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
that's actually not true we uh at the
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
Barry Bay at the the the end of the the
 
01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
dam end of the lake uh was in need of
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
replacement we actually had a sink hole
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
in front of it if you will uh and we're
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
able to use the old Dam as a coffer Dam
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
and install a new dam right right in
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
front of it uh and that that work is
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
basically done as far as the dam goes
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
however we need to finish things such
 
01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
such as the uh pedestrial control system
 
01:48:49.470 --> 01:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
so we can automate mate uh and then make
 
01:48:51.310 --> 01:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
the dam a little bit more efficient and
 
01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
did then do some uh modific is Upstream
 
01:48:56.430 --> 01:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
to look at the flow in the in the dam uh
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
but I will point out that's I think that
 
01:49:01.390 --> 01:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
was a very successful project and uh you
 
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
may remember from past discussions you
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
know it had but for that we'd have to
 
01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
drain the empowerment and uh we're
 
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
talking like a seven feet reduction in
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
the the uh water level of Lake op which
 
01:49:15.229 --> 01:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
I don't think uh would be very tolerable
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
for many um the next section uh is dams
 
01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
that are under our natural resource
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
conservation Service uh program so uh
 
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
this is uh again the the Dorchester Dam
 
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh is one of the dester dams was what
 
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here uh the the good
 
01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
news is the feds pay for a good chunk of
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
this but we're responsible for 35% of
 
01:49:42.669 --> 01:49:42.679 align:start position:0%
The Rehabilitation
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
cost the good news is they cover 100% of
 
01:49:46.709 --> 01:49:46.719 align:start position:0%
planning design and a lot of the
 
01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:49.159 align:start position:0%
engineering that's need needed to do uh
 
01:49:51.229 --> 01:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
but that's why that lapss is needed to
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
ensure uh right now we're waiting that
 
01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
can be done we're we're right now we're
 
01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for the natural resource
 
01:50:00.270 --> 01:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
conservation service to finalize uh
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
their Award of fed Federal fund so we
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
can proceed uh but we expect that
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully fairly soon uh so that's
 
01:50:09.390 --> 01:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for that that laps
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
extension is is
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
requested section 70 is uh many of you
 
01:50:17.550 --> 01:50:17.560 align:start position:0%
will remember some years back the
 
01:50:21.149 --> 01:50:21.159 align:start position:0%
Suncook uh River jumped its bank and uh
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
changed its flow for I think roughly
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
what one and a half miles uh so there
 
01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
was a lot of work done on that you can
 
01:50:31.310 --> 01:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
see it as you drive on routs four uh
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
right across the bridge in Epsom uh that
 
01:50:37.870 --> 01:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
work was done and then what we found was
 
01:50:40.629 --> 01:50:40.639 align:start position:0%
there was uh a lot of stabilization
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
issues uh with that that work on the
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
banking uh it was very complex work and
 
01:50:50.189 --> 01:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
in difficult uh situation there so
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
there's a need to maintain uh
 
01:50:56.669 --> 01:50:56.679 align:start position:0%
and Laps get an extension on that lapse
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh while we continue to and the contract
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh continues to uh do assessment and
 
01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
monitoring and and uh and do any
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
emergency construction uh services to
 
01:51:08.589 --> 01:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
keep that uh working as it should and we
 
01:51:11.310 --> 01:51:11.320 align:start position:0%
expect that to to last through 2023 as
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
the memo
 
01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
says and
 
01:51:19.629 --> 01:51:19.639 align:start position:0%
then we'll move ahead to our section 72
 
01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
thanks Chris
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
um so we still have additional work
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
needed on uh our air monitoring
 
01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
equipment in this is is is already done
 
01:51:33.229 --> 01:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
but we but in this item here we need
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
additional work uh on the uh the backend
 
01:51:39.790 --> 01:51:39.800 align:start position:0%
systems of our it uh systems and that
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
that'll be an ongoing discussion I think
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh including on Tuesday uh that's what
 
01:51:48.430 --> 01:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
that's about so much of that work the
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
original appropriation has been done but
 
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
we still have some some remaining
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
uh similar uh similarly on Section
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
32 uh we have uh this has to do with it
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
upgrades e permitting and
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
automation uh we have a remainder in our
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
capital budget of $998,000 uh we're
 
01:52:12.669 --> 01:52:12.679 align:start position:0%
asking to be carried forward uh and uh
 
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
we're we're programming that into our
 
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
pools program so our Pools and Spa
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
program uh which is Housing Department
 
01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services uh and in the
 
01:52:26.069 --> 01:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
wake of I think it was two years ago now
 
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
we had a a unfortunately we had a raft
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
of of a legionaire uh disease uh deaths
 
01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
in Hampton from from a a spa so that uh
 
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
understandably that made us look again
 
01:52:45.270 --> 01:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
at our rules uh and how that's working
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
so we've we've revamped our rules but we
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
also uh are developing a computer-based
 
01:52:54.629 --> 01:52:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh application system for uh inspections
 
01:52:56.790 --> 01:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
and monitoring of that program so that's
 
01:53:00.750 --> 01:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
what we're asking that lapse to do uh
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
and then moving uh to section
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
64 uh we have work uh that we hope to be
 
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
completed by this fall on uh pcao River
 
01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
Region uh this has to do with the Great
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
Bay and uh we've been working very
 
01:53:20.430 --> 01:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
closely with the U communities and the
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Agency on their
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
Federal non uh National pollution
 
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
discharge elimination system their nipy
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh permits uh in this particular case
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
for EPA is for nitrogen uh but but uh
 
01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
this work will help uh the region and
 
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
the municipalities to meet their
 
01:53:40.870 --> 01:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
statutory obligations uh with the
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
federal requirements uh so that's what
 
01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
that uh laps uh extension request is for
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh the next section uh 73 has to do with
 
01:53:53.069 --> 01:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
the w basaki River basin
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
again uh we the state owns and operates
 
01:53:59.910 --> 01:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh that uh Wastewater Treatment Facility
 
01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:00.589 align:start position:0%
uh that uh Wastewater Treatment Facility
in

01:54:00.589 --> 01:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
Frankin with collection systems
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
throughout 10 communities uh in The
 
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region uh that uh their Capital uh
 
01:54:12.669 --> 01:54:12.679 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan uh lays out the work
 
01:54:16.589 --> 01:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done this this uh work
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh just to point out is not something
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
that would be bonded uh all all this is
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:27.709 --> 01:54:27.719 align:start position:0%
communities and lastly as I mentioned
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
probably the the thing that's I guess
 
01:54:33.149 --> 01:54:33.159 align:start position:0%
the thing that's new would be new is we
 
01:54:35.550 --> 01:54:35.560 align:start position:0%
do are asking that we are allowed to
 
01:54:37.229 --> 01:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
repurpose uh
 
01:54:41.310 --> 01:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
funds uh from uh our former hazard waste
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh site uh funds to uh use for coastal
 
01:54:47.870 --> 01:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
flooding uh a modeling study that we
 
01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
would like to see done uh that allows us
 
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
to uh better react and better prepare
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
for uh flood plane Management on the
 
01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
coast uh so we we we are asking for that
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to that's probably our
 
01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
biggest thing I want to draw your
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
attention to uh and we're certainly
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
happy to uh answer any questions on that
 
01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
and then the very final thing is then
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
that of course there's uh about
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
$224,000 uh from the super fund match
 
01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
that we're not asking to be lapsed so so
 
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
happy any questions of course I I see a
 
01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
question from representative Edgar uh
 
01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
but just as an initial matter before I
 
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Edgar uh this
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
committee is a fact finding committee we
 
01:55:35.470 --> 01:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
won't be making a decision on that uh
 
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
what we'll be doing is presenting the
 
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
fact that you want it to the full
 
01:55:39.709 --> 01:55:39.719 align:start position:0%
committee and they will make the
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
decision and with that representative
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
Edgar uh thank you Mr chairman uh and
 
01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
thanks for the answer on this there was
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
an issue that um that you had put into
 
01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
the governor which he hadn't uh approved
 
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
it was the sixth I guess the six sixth
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
item on your list and it was three parts
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
and the third part was this uh flood
 
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
modeling um which I think was in the
 
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
range of
 
01:56:07.470 --> 01:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
350,000 is this the issue that you're uh
 
01:56:10.870 --> 01:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
trying to address with this uh with this
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
161,000 yeah this would be part of part
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
of that issue that's correct so you
 
01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
would still need the the balance of that
 
01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
if in fact this was uh uh this this was
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:27.470 --> 01:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh if you so desire right so obviously
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
we had a prioritized list and and that
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
was lower than some of the other things
 
01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
but yes what I think you're asking is
 
01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
disc cover that whole ask and the answer
 
01:56:39.069 --> 01:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
is obviously as you say we had a larger
 
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
ask in that that party party list but
 
01:56:43.709 --> 01:56:43.719 align:start position:0%
this would
 
01:56:48.669 --> 01:56:48.679 align:start position:0%
go this by applying this uh laps
 
01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
reapplying this repurposing excuse me uh
 
01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
these funds uh that would put us in a
 
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
much better place and and uh that's why
 
01:56:58.030 --> 01:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
we're asking for
 
01:57:00.990 --> 01:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
that shair if I do a followup quick
 
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
please uh thank you um so the again the
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
original request you had for this
 
01:57:07.589 --> 01:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
particular modeling was
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
350 thousand and this would apply you
 
01:57:12.669 --> 01:57:12.679 align:start position:0%
saying this would apply if in fact it
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
was approved by the committee for 161 of
 
01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
it would you still need I guess the
 
01:57:19.629 --> 01:57:19.639 align:start position:0%
balance so that you could do the whole
 
01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
modeling study so I again going to let
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
gonna let Sue Sue help me here but so
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
there there were multiple components of
 
01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:29.679 align:start position:0%
that ask one of them uh was for mercury
 
01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead Sue um yeah uh representative
 
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
Edgar good morning um what we did was we
 
01:57:40.669 --> 01:57:40.679 align:start position:0%
looked at the 350,000 for the for the
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
modeling and we felt U what we could do
 
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
if all we could get was the 161 is we
 
01:57:52.990 --> 01:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
would do um a partial start of the
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
modeling with this funds and then for
 
01:57:58.149 --> 01:57:58.159 align:start position:0%
the next bium ask for the balance to
 
01:58:00.069 --> 01:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
finish the modeling so essentially we
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
would phase the modeling um into two
 
01:58:06.069 --> 01:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
pieces in order to F fit the funding
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
you is that it Mike I have a question
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
about the very last sentence the 224,000
 
01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's not clear to me why you have no
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
lapse extension Authority uh we we could
 
01:58:24.270 --> 01:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
uh what's the source of funds and
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.709 align:start position:0%
 
Authority

01:58:29.709 --> 01:58:29.719 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:58:32.350 --> 01:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
um this is Susan Carlson again
 
01:58:33.790 --> 01:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
essentially we were given an
 
01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation back um in 2007 we
 
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
encumbered 100% of the
 
01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
funds and what we did was we rolled the
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
encumbrance forward from year to year oh
 
01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
we never asked for a lapse extension on
 
01:58:51.149 --> 01:58:51.159 align:start position:0%
this because the funds were fully
 
01:58:57.149 --> 01:58:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
it so you're actually lapsing zero
 
01:59:03.390 --> 01:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
because they're fully encumbered well we
 
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
the the this was a particular match to a
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
particular EPA superf fund site and
 
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
since um that site is now no
 
01:59:18.149 --> 01:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
longer um a super frun site it's now
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
under State Control this match money is
 
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
no longer needed so we unencumbered the
 
01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
lapse what I'm trying to get at is could
 
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
we repurpose that
 
01:59:39.870 --> 01:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
$224,000 or is it gone because it wasn't
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
extended is repres Jack I believe I'm
 
01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:44.719 align:start position:0%
sorry Sue I was
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
justad um so in House Bill 25 the
 
01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation was never extended because
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
it had been incumbered so they don't
 
01:59:54.030 --> 01:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
have the Authority there there's nothing
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
to continue the the
 
01:59:59.030 --> 01:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation uh because it was never
 
02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
extended back in 2011 or or 13 whatever
 
02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
the year was um so it will lapse at the
 
02:00:08.069 --> 02:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
end of this year unlike other projects
 
02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
that if you look at the 2019 House Bill
 
02:00:14.350 --> 02:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
25 there was a lapse extension granted
 
02:00:16.149 --> 02:00:16.159 align:start position:0%
right so then you would if there's
 
02:00:19.069 --> 02:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
something left at the end of this bium
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
related to those projects that were
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
extended lapses we could repurpose that
 
02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
right that's what I thought but I just
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure because I didn't
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
really know there's not enough
 
02:00:30.109 --> 02:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
information in this sentence to
 
02:00:32.069 --> 02:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
understand all of that no and and and
 
02:00:34.109 --> 02:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
it's I'm glad the department put it in
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
there because there may be a couple of
 
02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
other um Appropriations that agencies
 
02:00:40.350 --> 02:00:40.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned to the committee that they
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
believe could be repurposed I'm in the
 
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
process of reviewing um House Bill 25s
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
to see if they really carried forward
 
02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
the laps extension authorities right I
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
think in some cases what has happened is
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
that they've encumbered the the money in
 
02:00:58.149 --> 02:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
a prior fiscal year maybe it was related
 
02:01:00.149 --> 02:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
to a contract or something and and once
 
02:01:03.470 --> 02:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
the project completed um after cleanup
 
02:01:05.069 --> 02:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
you know they had an amount that would
 
02:01:07.149 --> 02:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't expended and and that with no
 
02:01:08.830 --> 02:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
lapse extension Authority would just go
 
02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
back up naturally yeah that happens
 
02:01:15.629 --> 02:01:15.639 align:start position:0%
every time correct yeah the one final
 
02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
comment I'll make is it was really
 
02:01:18.990 --> 02:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
helpful to have this presentation ahead
 
02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:20.189 align:start position:0%
helpful to have this presentation ahead
of

02:01:20.189 --> 02:01:20.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
time even if it was
 
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
only a brief amount ahead of time
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
because of the the cross correlation
 
02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
that needed to be done so there's an
 
02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
example of why to uh send the committee
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
your presentation ahead of
 
02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
time and we'll try next time to get it
 
02:01:41.149 --> 02:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
to you even sooner yeah was there
 
02:01:43.069 --> 02:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
anything further that you wanted to say
 
02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
committee

02:01:57.990 --> 02:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.669 --> 02:02:00.679 align:start position:0%
I just I I think i' say is thank you oh
 
02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
well thank you for coming uh it's always
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
a pleasure and uh we'll as we said we'll
 
02:02:10.510 --> 02:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
take that uh repurpose request to the
 
02:02:14.109 --> 02:02:14.119 align:start position:0%
committee and uh uh there's probably at
 
02:02:16.069 --> 02:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
least one person on the committee who
 
02:02:20.830 --> 02:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
happen thank you representative egar
 
02:02:26.069 --> 02:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
much so let's see what we have I do not
 
02:02:36.270 --> 02:02:36.280 align:start position:0%
see the next agency so at this point uh
 
02:02:38.589 --> 02:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
I do not see the next agency they are
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
not scheduled until
 
02:02:45.390 --> 02:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
11:20 so this seems like a great time to
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
take a break uh remember that the mics
 
02:02:51.189 --> 02:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
are on we have when we're fully remote
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
like this we have have no way of turning
 
02:02:52.679 --> 02:02:54.110 align:start position:0%
like this we have have no way of turning
them

02:02:54.110 --> 02:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:02:54.120 --> 02:03:20.750 align:start position:0%
them

completing what we've already started uh
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%

have uh four projects um lapsing at the
 
02:21:32.590 --> 02:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
end of this fiscal year uh with a sum
 
02:21:50.790 --> 02:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:53.040 align:start position:0%

well I see no
 
02:21:57.240 --> 02:21:59.790 align:start position:0%
well I see no
questions

02:21:59.790 --> 02:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:22:02.990 --> 02:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
02:22:08.389 --> 02:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh right I see no questions uh I I have
 
02:22:10.230 --> 02:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
no uh was there anything further you
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.110 --> 02:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
say uh for my part no I I will defer to
 
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
my colleague
 
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
Tom uh unless this question on the list
 
02:22:23.070 --> 02:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
I think that states our position we can
 
02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
certainly talk about any particular
 
02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
project if you wanted us to elaborate on
 
02:22:30.950 --> 02:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
them uh no the main thing we need to
 
02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
find out is whether the list in House
 
02:22:36.630 --> 02:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 25 is correct and it is with the
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
two lapses with the two deletions
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
noted so I think that's what we need to
 
02:22:46.910 --> 02:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
know very well thank you for coming it's
 
02:22:48.429 --> 02:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
always a
 
02:22:51.790 --> 02:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
pleasure thank you very well thank you
 
02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
yeah I see that
 
02:22:54.479 --> 02:22:56.710 align:start position:0%
yeah I see that
the

02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
agitant person is here so let's bring
 
02:23:04.910 --> 02:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
over let's see
 
02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
here so the agant is the Department of I
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
um it's now the department of military
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
Affairs and veteran services uh it's on

114 morning for the welcome Mr Perry
 
02:23:35.070 --> 02:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
always a pleasure I have to say it's a
 
02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
little unnerving that we don't have
 
02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
agitant right there at the top like we
 
02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:40.990 align:start position:0%
agitant right there at the top like we
always

02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
always
 
02:23:43.389 --> 02:23:43.399 align:start position:0%
did yes sir it's now it's the uh
 
02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
Department as you say the department of
 
02:23:46.870 --> 02:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran services

very well we've been getting a lot of
 
02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
good feedback from the operation yes it
 
02:24:00.190 --> 02:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
did they asked me if I had any questions
 
02:24:03.150 --> 02:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
mtis he is uh he is currently in he
 
02:24:08.269 --> 02:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
sends his regrets he is currently at a
 
02:24:10.309 --> 02:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
senior assistant training program uh for
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
General officers with the National Guard
 
02:24:13.870 --> 02:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
Bureau and he'll be back into the state
 
02:24:16.510 --> 02:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
on Monday yeah we always enjoy seeing
 
02:24:20.349 --> 02:24:20.359 align:start position:0%
seeing the general uh so they have 13
 
02:24:23.550 --> 02:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
iions uh they're a little bit out of
 
02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
order with respect to their numbers uh
 
02:24:28.870 --> 02:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
and I did find two lines that we need to
 
02:24:31.150 --> 02:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
add so if you however you want to
 
02:24:33.550 --> 02:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
proceed if you want to go item by
 
02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:35.349 align:start position:0%
proceed if you want to go item by
item

02:24:35.349 --> 02:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
item
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh is it's your preference I can go in
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
the item number in the bill as
 
02:24:42.389 --> 02:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
introduced I can just but I'll bounce
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
around on the letter that we have so
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
whatever me have in front of them I'll
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
follow that order maybe if Mr Shay could
 
02:24:51.790 --> 02:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
share the presentation
 
02:24:53.670 --> 02:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
and I'll do what I did before and
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
transfer the line and and uh translate
 
02:25:05.269 --> 02:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
numbers you see it now yes we do all
 
02:25:11.550 --> 02:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
righty so just direct me as you uh would
 
02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
like moreen as we go along all right
 
02:25:18.429 --> 02:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
120 that's correct so this is is uh this
 
02:25:23.630 --> 02:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
really is a hazard remediation at our
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
facility in Pembrook uh this line of
 
02:25:28.469 --> 02:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
accounting was frozen uh when covid
 
02:25:30.269 --> 02:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
started in terms of the governor's
 
02:25:32.990 --> 02:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
ability to allow us to spend our our uh
 
02:25:35.750 --> 02:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
our Capital Money uh it is a two-part
 
02:25:38.110 --> 02:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
process one is the investigation line we
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
anticipate that that line of that to
 
02:25:42.670 --> 02:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
conduct the investigation of any hazards
 
02:25:45.190 --> 02:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
that are on that facility would be done
 
02:25:47.630 --> 02:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh in the winter of 21 and then
 
02:25:49.269 --> 02:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
intermediation that has to be done would
 
02:25:51.269 --> 02:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
be done by the winter of 22 we request
 
02:25:55.950 --> 02:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
that this uh be uh be extended it is uh
 
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
as you can see 100% general
 
02:26:01.070 --> 02:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
fund next one is
 
02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
114 so this is uh for the aviation
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
Readiness uh facility that we have 100%
 
02:26:10.230 --> 02:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
federal funds uh we have uh we have
 
02:26:12.429 --> 02:26:12.439 align:start position:0%
given a notice to proceed uh we we
 
02:26:14.269 --> 02:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
anticipate that they're going to ground
 
02:26:17.269 --> 02:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
break ground very very soon in April uh
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
and we'll be able to spend the rest of
 
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
that money and complete that project in
 
02:26:23.550 --> 02:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
the spring of
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
2022 this is
 
02:26:29.710 --> 02:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
115 uh this is uh for federal and state
 
02:26:33.429 --> 02:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
repairs part of this is for uh the uh a
 
02:26:36.510 --> 02:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
renovation of our maintenance facility
 
02:26:38.269 --> 02:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh it's in the renovation is under
 
02:26:40.469 --> 02:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
construction we anticipate this spring
 
02:26:42.469 --> 02:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
completing that piece and then there are
 
02:26:47.269 --> 02:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
several projects uh uh to get after
 
02:26:49.469 --> 02:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
maintenance uh roof Replacements
 
02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
flooring all those kinds of things uh
 
02:26:56.190 --> 02:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
that we will uh uh we complete as the
 
02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
federal funds continue to uh to funnel
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
into the system again 100% federal funds
 
02:27:03.950 --> 02:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
here so we really you know it's not not
 
02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
not a burden on the state actually kind
 
02:27:07.550 --> 02:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
of wifall for the state for the rest of
 
02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
that 1212
 
02:27:13.469 --> 02:27:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:16.070 --> 02:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
116 uh we did award the design we're
 
02:27:19.269 --> 02:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
going to we anticipate uh for this uh uh
 
02:27:20.830 --> 02:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
it's a maintenance shop in Littleton
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
that we're going to build uh adjacent to
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
the Readiness Center that's there uh we
 
02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
have awarded the design uh well we'll
 
02:27:31.230 --> 02:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
award the design for that uh after the
 
02:27:34.469 --> 02:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
April GNC meeting approves our piece we
 
02:27:35.870 --> 02:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
anticipate that construction will be
 
02:27:39.269 --> 02:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
complete on that facility in uh in 2023
 
02:27:41.630 --> 02:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
2023 this is
 
02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
117 uh this uh 117 also is impacted by
 
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
covid uh we it's a 50-50 money that uh
 
02:27:55.269 --> 02:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
that we have uh the first and the reason
 
02:27:57.190 --> 02:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
it was impacted by covid is because the
 
02:27:59.190 --> 02:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
original bids exceeded the budget so
 
02:28:01.230 --> 02:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
we're going and then we had a freeze on
 
02:28:04.590 --> 02:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
spending any more of our Capital Money
 
02:28:07.150 --> 02:28:07.160 align:start position:0%
based on the pandemic we anticipate that
 
02:28:08.510 --> 02:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to continue to work
 
02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
through these projects through the
 
02:28:13.230 --> 02:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
summer of 2022 again uh this is this is
 
02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
a 5050 account though uh it and it gets
 
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
after uh making sure that we have the
 
02:28:21.510 --> 02:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate anti-terrorism Force
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:30.070 --> 02:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:33.950 --> 02:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
is8 so what we did with this one is uh
 
02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
we because this is a 7525 project right
 
02:28:39.670 --> 02:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
you can see it say 75% federal funds and
 
02:28:43.750 --> 02:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
25% uh General funds we were able to to
 
02:28:48.550 --> 02:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
swap uh some 100% federally funded
 
02:28:50.429 --> 02:28:50.439 align:start position:0%
projects with the federal money that we
 
02:28:52.710 --> 02:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
had and push this one down so that we
 
02:28:55.389 --> 02:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
would mitigate the impact of covid on
 
02:28:58.950 --> 02:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
the state so we adjusted the timeline uh
 
02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
and that's why you're seeing a delay
 
02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
here it's on hold for a design project
 
02:29:05.429 --> 02:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
now in 2023 with construction in
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
2025 uh and we anticipate completing the
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
construction uh in 2026 so you know
 
02:29:14.269 --> 02:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
because we had some 100% federally
 
02:29:16.190 --> 02:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursed projects that we could move
 
02:29:18.990 --> 02:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
up in the in the timeline we were able
 
02:29:20.670 --> 02:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
to kind of delay this a little bit and
 
02:29:23.309 --> 02:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
kind of mitigate the impact on on the
 
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
state next one is
 
02:29:28.590 --> 02:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
119 like uh another this is a Aviation
 
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
Hangar Bay uh we're still pending
 
02:29:32.190 --> 02:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
additional budget efforts by the
 
02:29:34.510 --> 02:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
department of safety uh you may remember
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
that this project is a joint project
 
02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
between our Aviation facility and the
 
02:29:41.550 --> 02:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
state police Aviation facility uh we
 
02:29:44.670 --> 02:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
anticipate that we'll get this uh when
 
02:29:47.030 --> 02:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
safety gets their their budgeting
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
aligned to be able to complete this in
 
02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:51.630 align:start position:0%
aligned to be able to complete this in
2023

02:29:51.630 --> 02:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
2023
 
02:29:53.790 --> 02:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
next one needs to be added that's
 
02:29:56.349 --> 02:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
correct it is uh it is just minor
 
02:29:58.910 --> 02:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
military construction uh and we would
 
02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
like this added into the list uh we are
 
02:30:03.870 --> 02:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
it's just punch list items on a $5
 
02:30:05.790 --> 02:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
million project that we had we
 
02:30:07.550 --> 02:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
anticipate this fall being able to close
 
02:30:10.349 --> 02:30:10.359 align:start position:0%
this one out what we don't want to do is
 
02:30:13.469 --> 02:30:13.479 align:start position:0%
uh lapse this money uh and and not have
 
02:30:15.030 --> 02:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
something come up in the in the
 
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
contingency items of the contract uh to
 
02:30:21.070 --> 02:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh to be able to address them before
 
02:30:22.510 --> 02:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
we get all the punch list work done on
 
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
that project yeah there's no issue with
 
02:30:26.510 --> 02:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
ADD adding a line we do it all the time
 
02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:35.070 --> 02:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
missing uh the next item is uh number
 
02:30:37.590 --> 02:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
124 y so this is this is money that
 
02:30:39.910 --> 02:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
we've had for a while to purchase land
 
02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
we were in the process of completing a
 
02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
purchase and sale agreement last March
 
02:30:46.510 --> 02:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh for a parcel in Franklin when we were
 
02:30:48.349 --> 02:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
told hey ceas and assist spending the
 
02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
capital money because we didn't know
 
02:30:53.590 --> 02:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
what the impact would be uh we are uh we
 
02:30:56.590 --> 02:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
are based on our our recommended budget
 
02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
our capital budget we are researching
 
02:31:00.469 --> 02:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's good to purchase
 
02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
that land we' already gone after or to
 
02:31:05.110 --> 02:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
look for a new parcel so uh we
 
02:31:07.349 --> 02:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
anticipate by the end of the Fall a year
 
02:31:09.790 --> 02:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
from now we'll be able to liquidate this
 
02:31:12.269 --> 02:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
money but it's it's uh it's really
 
02:31:15.309 --> 02:31:15.319 align:start position:0%
important that we have money in a land
 
02:31:18.110 --> 02:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
account uh because we can't get Federal
 
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
funding to construct facilities without
 
02:31:22.469 --> 02:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
land so that's why that one is
 
02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
important now the next item also needs
 
02:31:27.870 --> 02:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
to be added that's correct so this is a
 
02:31:30.269 --> 02:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
design ARR in the center in Pembrook uh
 
02:31:32.429 --> 02:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
and again this is punch list items here
 
02:31:34.230 --> 02:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
right so the next three items are kind
 
02:31:37.309 --> 02:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
of linked uh this one is not in and we'd
 
02:31:39.550 --> 02:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
like it added it's punch list items for
 
02:31:42.070 --> 02:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
100% Federal part of the newly designed
 
02:31:44.469 --> 02:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
and newly constructed uh Rus Center we
 
02:31:47.550 --> 02:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
have in Pembrook adjacent to the ectc so
 
02:31:48.870 --> 02:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
we're just working through the punch
 
02:31:50.429 --> 02:31:50.439 align:start position:0%
list items on that want to have that
 
02:31:53.469 --> 02:31:53.479 align:start position:0%
contingency available to us the next two
 
02:31:55.269 --> 02:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
lines are also associated with that
 
02:31:58.349 --> 02:31:58.359 align:start position:0%
Readiness Center this is line line 121
 
02:32:01.070 --> 02:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
the next two it right so you can see
 
02:32:04.710 --> 02:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
them uh the one that's listed 15 one six
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
and some zeros and 1962 and some zeros
 
02:32:11.429 --> 02:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
are both uh linked so the state active
 
02:32:14.150 --> 02:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
duty Annex really is to support the the
 
02:32:16.269 --> 02:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
equipment and the facilities when the
 
02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
governor orders the National Guard into
 
02:32:20.349 --> 02:32:20.359 align:start position:0%
to State uh active duty that's 100%
 
02:32:23.110 --> 02:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
generally funded and the other piece is
 
02:32:25.630 --> 02:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
the actual Readiness Center itself and
 
02:32:27.389 --> 02:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
again that construction is complete and
 
02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
those uh the lapsed uh the unencumbered
 
02:32:32.830 --> 02:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
balances really are just to make sure we
 
02:32:36.389 --> 02:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
have contingency for uh for punch list
 
02:32:37.910 --> 02:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
items as they go and we should be able
 
02:32:39.670 --> 02:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
to close those out in in the coming
 
02:32:41.670 --> 02:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
months you know certainly by the end of
 
02:32:47.790 --> 02:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
122 122 is again for our Readiness
 
02:32:52.429 --> 02:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
Center uh that's going to be adjacent to
 
02:32:56.110 --> 02:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
our Aviation facility again uh uh the
 
02:32:57.870 --> 02:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
current balance of unencumbered is is a
 
02:32:59.710 --> 02:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
a small amount of money we're working
 
02:33:01.750 --> 02:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
through the design and uh in
 
02:33:04.429 --> 02:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
construction is in process we anticipate
 
02:33:06.870 --> 02:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
that being done in uh in
 
02:33:10.150 --> 02:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
2022 and last item is
 
02:33:12.590 --> 02:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
124 right so again this is another one
 
02:33:15.309 --> 02:33:15.319 align:start position:0%
of the items that was impacted by uh
 
02:33:19.070 --> 02:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
covid uh we were in the process of of uh
 
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
of award in a contract to do
 
02:33:23.349 --> 02:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
archaeological surveys at the Veteran
 
02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
Cemetery uh this is important because as
 
02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
we continue to fill up the Veteran
 
02:33:29.349 --> 02:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
Cemetery we need to develop the
 
02:33:31.830 --> 02:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
undeveloped areas of the cemetery So
 
02:33:34.830 --> 02:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
currently only 20 of the 60 developable
 
02:33:39.309 --> 02:33:39.319 align:start position:0%
areas are uh are are developed
 
02:33:41.870 --> 02:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
essentially we can bury people there by
 
02:33:44.110 --> 02:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
conducting this archaeological survey we
 
02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
can prep the remaining 40 acres of area
 
02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
so that we can award contact uh contract
 
02:33:53.269 --> 02:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
for expansion uh in the future without
 
02:33:54.790 --> 02:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
having to worry about the archaeological
 
02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
surveys again we were you know when Co
 
02:33:59.150 --> 02:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
hit we were awarding the contract we
 
02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
stopped and now we're in the process of
 
02:34:03.230 --> 02:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
working that again it's not a lot of
 
02:34:06.269 --> 02:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
money but uh but doing it now will sync
 
02:34:09.910 --> 02:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
our ability to expand with the timing
 
02:34:11.469 --> 02:34:11.479 align:start position:0%
that the federal government and the
 
02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
Veterans Administration Awards us uh
 
02:34:18.750 --> 02:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
expansion uh funds so that's uh that
 
02:34:20.309 --> 02:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
goes through the list I can pause here
 
02:34:22.030 --> 02:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
and answer any questions about any of
 
02:34:25.070 --> 02:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
those uh any of those items yeah I don't
 
02:34:28.309 --> 02:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
see any questions right at the moment so
 
02:34:32.070 --> 02:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
let's see the
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
general the big item there so there's a
 
02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
couple big items uh they're 100% Federal
 
02:34:43.070 --> 02:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
the 87 the one that's 87,000 is that so
 
02:34:45.389 --> 02:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
50% of that would be
 
02:34:50.950 --> 02:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
General yes okay so we do have we have
 
02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
some money there we could
 
02:34:55.630 --> 02:34:55.640 align:start position:0%
use uh most of it being Federal we
 
02:34:57.469 --> 02:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to and the Statewide
 
02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
Fire is also 50% so there's some money
 
02:35:04.030 --> 02:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
there yes all
 
02:35:06.510 --> 02:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
right I see no questions was there
 
02:35:08.830 --> 02:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
anything that you wanted to add it's
 
02:35:11.790 --> 02:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
always a pleasure to see the
 
02:35:14.269 --> 02:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
adant it's always a pleasure to be here
 
02:35:15.790 --> 02:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
uh if there are no questions we just uh
 
02:35:18.190 --> 02:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your continued support uh
 
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
to the National Guard uh as you know
 
02:35:22.710 --> 02:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
I'll just give you a a quick snapshot
 
02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:24.030 align:start position:0%
I'll just give you a a quick snapshot
about

02:35:24.030 --> 02:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
780 men and women are still supporting
 
02:35:29.429 --> 02:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
the missions uh in support of the the
 
02:35:31.590 --> 02:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic and uh they're very proud to do
 
02:35:33.429 --> 02:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
so and they're very proud to serve the
 
02:35:35.150 --> 02:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire so anying any
 
02:35:37.429 --> 02:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
questions you have that's all I have sir
 
02:35:38.990 --> 02:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
I know for a fact that the Civil Air
 
02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
Patrol was very uh uh pleased with the
 
02:35:44.870 --> 02:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
building with the training building that
 
02:35:47.389 --> 02:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
they held an have held a couple of
 
02:35:47.399 --> 02:35:48.630 align:start position:0%
they held an have held a couple of
events

02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
events
 
02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:52.230 align:start position:0%
events
in

02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:54.030 --> 02:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
yes and we're happy to support them as
 
02:35:57.710 --> 02:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
well sir yeah and with that I guess uh
 
02:36:00.590 --> 02:36:00.600 align:start position:0%

02:36:03.030 --> 02:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
agent thank you sir have a great day

it sounds uh we expect to have that um

to explain that completion date because
 
04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
it seems further out than we would
 
04:01:37.309 --> 04:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise expect um if that serves the

maximize the technology the it
 
04:02:00.830 --> 04:02:00.840 align:start position:0%

04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
waiting and waiting to move forward on
 
04:02:38.149 --> 04:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
that to go out to bid we did have some
 
04:02:40.990 --> 04:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
work done um with regard to design and
 
04:02:43.149 --> 04:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
and review of that infrastructure prior
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
to covid-19 and sort of the slow that
 
04:02:48.510 --> 04:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
created within the logistics world so
 
04:02:52.389 --> 04:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
that project is a total appropriation of
 
04:02:55.830 --> 04:02:55.840 align:start position:0%

delays and spits and and starts with
 
04:03:10.309 --> 04:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
regard to that because of covid-19 and
 
04:03:12.910 --> 04:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
having units under quarantine but we've
 
04:03:14.349 --> 04:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
been working with the
 
04:03:16.670 --> 04:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh approved vendor the bid award has
 
04:03:18.750 --> 04:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
happened and we're hoping to start work
 
04:03:20.870 --> 04:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
as soon as next month with a completion
 
04:03:24.269 --> 04:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
date of 20121 that'll that'll really uh
 
04:03:26.110 --> 04:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
improve the bathroom situation in those
 
04:03:28.950 --> 04:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
two units with a total not to exceed
 
04:03:34.349 --> 04:03:34.359 align:start position:0%

04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
replacement for men's uh you know we
 
04:03:43.990 --> 04:03:44.000 align:start position:0%

Appropriations to replace numerous doors
 
04:03:49.030 --> 04:03:49.040 align:start position:0%

exceed of
 
04:03:55.070 --> 04:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
$93,000 so as I sped ahead on number 10

04:03:59.309 --> 04:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
John if you want to comment I know we've
 
04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
made some movement in that area on
 
04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
projects 10 and 11 thank you
 
04:04:05.309 --> 04:04:05.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner so both those projects

actually the bids close this Wednesday
 
04:04:11.229 --> 04:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
the March 10th 2 o' BS came in reviewed
 
04:04:13.469 --> 04:04:13.479 align:start position:0%
them and as of about an hour ago
 
04:04:15.149 --> 04:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
actually actually we have agreed with
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
all the numbers on that so that one will
 
04:04:19.550 --> 04:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
move forward to GNC those are the two
 
04:04:22.189 --> 04:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
projects that we combin the body L and
 
04:04:24.550 --> 04:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
the camera systems so that is now a go
 
04:04:27.229 --> 04:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
finally after a couple of hiccups with
 
04:04:27.239 --> 04:04:28.469 align:start position:0%
finally after a couple of hiccups with
the

04:04:28.469 --> 04:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:04:32.630 --> 04:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
contracts and then on number 12 that was
 
04:04:32.640 --> 04:04:34.349 align:start position:0%
contracts and then on number 12 that was
for

04:04:34.349 --> 04:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:04:38.349 --> 04:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
the FF for the new women's prison uh we
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
still have some small uh not to exceed
 
04:04:42.630 --> 04:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
amounts of the
 
04:04:46.349 --> 04:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
$3,310 68 just buttoning up some FF and
 
04:04:48.389 --> 04:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
in that
 
04:04:51.149 --> 04:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
area making sure I don't scroll past my
 
04:04:55.870 --> 04:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
pages on slide six these are the same
 
04:04:58.189 --> 04:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
numbers I presented during the last uh
 
04:05:00.309 --> 04:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
discussion of projects scheduled to
 
04:05:02.110 --> 04:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
lapse June 30
 
04:05:04.870 --> 04:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
2021 um and the dates and times for
 
04:05:06.670 --> 04:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
those projects including the stee line
 
04:05:07.950 --> 04:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
injector at the New Hampshire state
 
04:05:09.149 --> 04:05:09.159 align:start position:0%
prison for
 
04:05:12.110 --> 04:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
men uh do the additional dollars
 
04:05:14.590 --> 04:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
associated with the women's prison and
 
04:05:16.429 --> 04:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
uh the removal and replacement of two
 
04:05:19.030 --> 04:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
oil tanks and one diesel tank the
 
04:05:21.309 --> 04:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
elevator replacement project which
 
04:05:23.070 --> 04:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
occurred both at Men's and within the
 
04:05:25.630 --> 04:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
secure psychiatric unit and then the
 
04:05:28.189 --> 04:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
secure housing unit door control system
 
04:05:32.550 --> 04:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
with a total lapse of those projects of
 
04:05:32.560 --> 04:05:35.910 align:start position:0%
with a total lapse of those projects of
$2,849

04:05:35.910 --> 04:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:39.590 --> 04:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
55 so with that um I wasn't able to
 
04:05:42.269 --> 04:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
understand on the on the women's prison
 
04:05:44.590 --> 04:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
uh you want to you want to extend that
 
04:05:46.149 --> 04:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
even though you think it'll be complete
 
04:05:47.990 --> 04:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
just on the theory that you might have a
 
04:05:50.750 --> 04:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:54.389 --> 04:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
later speaking are you referencing 12 uh
 
04:05:57.790 --> 04:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
item 12 yes so item 12 that's that's the
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
remainder there's only a very small am
 
04:06:01.630 --> 04:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
money left in that we've obviously gone
 
04:06:03.269 --> 04:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
through a little over two years now with
 
04:06:06.110 --> 04:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
that facility and this is a about three
 
04:06:09.830 --> 04:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
or $4,000 actually only left in this um
 
04:06:11.830 --> 04:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
this amount of money now and we will be
 
04:06:13.309 --> 04:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
expending that very soon I would think
 
04:06:15.870 --> 04:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
with next month or two so do you want to
 
04:06:18.670 --> 04:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
extend that or or not extend
 
04:06:21.750 --> 04:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
it I believe we're going to extend it
 
04:06:24.429 --> 04:06:24.439 align:start position:0%
before June of 2021 so we won't be
 
04:06:28.269 --> 04:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
extending it okay so we will delete uh
 
04:06:32.149 --> 04:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
our item number 55 your item number 12
 
04:06:34.910 --> 04:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
from House Bill 25 is that
 
04:06:37.110 --> 04:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
correct yes thank you sorry for that
 
04:06:39.510 --> 04:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
confusion okay
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
great that's what we're here for
 
04:06:44.550 --> 04:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
04:06:47.309 --> 04:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
uh see any questions from the committee
 
04:06:50.070 --> 04:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see any uh was there anything
 
04:06:52.309 --> 04:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
you wanted to
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
say anything you want to add John um the
 
04:06:57.790 --> 04:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
only thing I wanted to add Mr chairman
 
04:07:00.110 --> 04:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
is that this week has been a flurry of
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
activity because we've had the all the
 
04:07:03.710 --> 04:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
projects open up now there were many on
 
04:07:05.790 --> 04:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
hold and if you see how some of those
 
04:07:08.349 --> 04:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
dates go back quite ways that's because
 
04:07:10.030 --> 04:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
with Co there was some restrictions and
 
04:07:11.309 --> 04:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
we couldn't get some things off the
 
04:07:13.950 --> 04:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
ground but starting as up Tuesday of
 
04:07:15.790 --> 04:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
this week we've really seen quite a bit
 
04:07:17.309 --> 04:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
of activity from public works and things
 
04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
are moving forward very nicely yeah well
 
04:07:20.990 --> 04:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's certainly been true of every
 
04:07:23.189 --> 04:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
agency that the work was slowed down
 
04:07:25.269 --> 04:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
that's why we have a lot of laps
 
04:07:28.830 --> 04:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
extensions this year but uh with that we
 
04:07:31.469 --> 04:07:31.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in it's always a
 
04:07:33.429 --> 04:07:33.439 align:start position:0%
pleasure it's always a pleasure to see
 
04:07:35.790 --> 04:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
Corrections and we all have fond
 
04:07:38.590 --> 04:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
memories of visiting the women's prison
 
04:07:40.349 --> 04:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
well we look forward to uh letting you
 
04:07:41.990 --> 04:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
all come into the other facilities when
 
04:07:44.229 --> 04:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
things get closer to uh whatever The New
 
04:07:46.590 --> 04:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
Normal is and I thank my favorite part
 
04:07:49.510 --> 04:07:49.520 align:start position:0%

04:09:05.950 --> 04:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
could have Mr Shay put it up that would
 
04:09:09.070 --> 04:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
be good that way we can follow along all
 
04:09:12.630 --> 04:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
right I can see it so so why don't you
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
just go ahead from item to item if
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
there's a question I'll let you know
 
04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay on page two is a list of all the
 
04:09:20.870 --> 04:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
items uh but with your concurrence we'll
 
04:09:22.550 --> 04:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
move to page three where we start to
 
04:09:25.590 --> 04:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
discuss them individually right and I
 
04:09:27.550 --> 04:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
will let Steve take the lead on
 
04:09:29.630 --> 04:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
that thanks commissioner so the first
 
04:09:32.550 --> 04:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
item which is line 146 um in in the
 
04:09:34.510 --> 04:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
budget bill this is the fire academy
 
04:09:37.950 --> 04:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
hbac upgrade um this is a project that
 
04:09:40.149 --> 04:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
we had some delays I'm sure you've heard
 
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
other agencies have had delays as well
 
04:09:45.070 --> 04:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
um but they were also some unexpected um
 
04:09:47.149 --> 04:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
latent conditions that were discovered
 
04:09:49.269 --> 04:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
which has um resulted in some increased
 
04:09:52.349 --> 04:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
costs this was originally uh uh going to
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
fund three components one was replacing
 
04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
boilers secondly uh building management
 
04:09:59.510 --> 04:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
system for all the fire academy
 
04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
facilities and third replace a vehicle
 
04:10:04.710 --> 04:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
exhaust system uh because of the cost of
 
04:10:06.630 --> 04:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
the boiler which has been replaced and
 
04:10:09.070 --> 04:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
the associated piping um with that
 
04:10:11.269 --> 04:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
project um we're no longer able to
 
04:10:14.229 --> 04:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
complete all three uh we have found
 
04:10:16.710 --> 04:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
operating funds to uh replace the
 
04:10:19.309 --> 04:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
exhaust system in the firehouse um so
 
04:10:20.830 --> 04:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
that leaves the building management
 
04:10:23.349 --> 04:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
system upgrade um we do have some
 
04:10:25.630 --> 04:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
additional funds available in a project
 
04:10:27.550 --> 04:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
the next project that I'll speak to
 
04:10:30.429 --> 04:10:30.439 align:start position:0%
74,000 remaining um and so we will be
 
04:10:32.429 --> 04:10:32.439 align:start position:0%
asking the committee to consider
 
04:10:35.389 --> 04:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
allowing us to repurpose that $74,000
 
04:10:37.269 --> 04:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
from the next project back into this
 
04:10:39.750 --> 04:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
HVAC upgrade to allow us to complete the
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
building management component of
 
04:10:44.149 --> 04:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:10:47.550 --> 04:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
$74,000 comes from um the next project
 
04:10:50.309 --> 04:10:50.319 align:start position:0%
which is on line 147 this is the
 
04:10:52.469 --> 04:10:52.479 align:start position:0%
replacement of the fire Academy's ladder
 
04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
truck uh this was a 22-year old uh
 
04:10:57.670 --> 04:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
ladder truck that um has been used in
 
04:11:00.510 --> 04:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
training operations uh it's entirely
 
04:11:03.710 --> 04:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
manual um analog equipment and the uh
 
04:11:05.469 --> 04:11:05.479 align:start position:0%
profession has moved towards digital
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
controls and so we need to make sure
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
that we are training our firefighters
 
04:11:11.229 --> 04:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
with updated equipment uh that truck has
 
04:11:13.590 --> 04:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
been uh purchased the purchase order in
 
04:11:15.870 --> 04:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
place it's being it will be built and we
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
expect it will be delivered in April of
 
04:11:20.269 --> 04:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
2022 and so since we know the cost of
 
04:11:22.269 --> 04:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
that vehicle um there's
 
04:11:24.790 --> 04:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
$74,000 remaining in that capital budget
 
04:11:27.630 --> 04:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
line um and this is the 74,000 we'd
 
04:11:29.830 --> 04:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
asked to repurpose to the other fire
 
04:11:31.469 --> 04:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
academy projects so we can complete the
 
04:11:34.109 --> 04:11:34.119 align:start position:0%
HVAC project and I do have some uh
 
04:11:35.590 --> 04:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
proposed language at the end of the
 
04:11:37.550 --> 04:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
presentation um if that's something the
 
04:11:39.710 --> 04:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
committee would like to consider uh
 
04:11:39.720 --> 04:11:40.670 align:start position:0%
committee would like to consider uh
looking

04:11:40.670 --> 04:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
looking
 
04:11:44.950 --> 04:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
at the next project we have is line 148
 
04:11:47.389 --> 04:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
this is to create a criminal records
 
04:11:50.269 --> 04:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
portal really two phases two steps to
 
04:11:52.349 --> 04:11:52.359 align:start position:0%
this the first is uh allowing
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
individuals to schedule their
 
04:11:56.910 --> 04:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
fingerprint appointments online and then
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
phase two would allow individuals to
 
04:12:00.870 --> 04:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
request and receive their criminal
 
04:12:04.030 --> 04:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
history records online um the phase one
 
04:12:06.630 --> 04:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
development is is complete at this point
 
04:12:08.269 --> 04:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
and we've moved into user acceptance
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
testing uh we expect phase one to be
 
04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
fully implemented by June uh phase two
 
04:12:15.670 --> 04:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
development and implementation will will
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
follow once we've completed that that
 
04:12:19.750 --> 04:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
first implementation and we expect the
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
project to be completed by January of
 
04:12:25.910 --> 04:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
2022 the next project is The Troop C
 
04:12:28.870 --> 04:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
renovation uh Troop C is the state
 
04:12:32.870 --> 04:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
police uh troop facility in Keen it was
 
04:12:33.830 --> 04:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
built in
 
04:12:36.469 --> 04:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
1981 uh and the renovation includes
 
04:12:39.070 --> 04:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
replacing the hfac system and completely
 
04:12:41.469 --> 04:12:41.479 align:start position:0%
remodeling um the internals of the
 
04:12:43.830 --> 04:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
facility to meet current operational
 
04:12:47.189 --> 04:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
needs um that project design is complete
 
04:12:49.750 --> 04:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
and the request for proposals is was
 
04:12:52.030 --> 04:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
released and we're expecting bids uh
 
04:12:53.950 --> 04:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
next week for a bid opening on March
 
04:12:57.309 --> 04:12:57.319 align:start position:0%
17th and so that's continuing to move
 
04:13:00.950 --> 04:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
forward the next project line 151 is an
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
online customer portal for the DMV uh
 
04:13:05.710 --> 04:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
and this continues the DMV's move
 
04:13:08.109 --> 04:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
towards processing online transactions
 
04:13:10.469 --> 04:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
whenever possible and so this project
 
04:13:13.070 --> 04:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
would um redesign the existing online
 
04:13:15.830 --> 04:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
onine transactions but then also create
 
04:13:18.550 --> 04:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
online transactions for duplicate driver
 
04:13:21.109 --> 04:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
licenses driver history reports and then
 
04:13:24.870 --> 04:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
driver license restoration fees the um
 
04:13:26.590 --> 04:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
several of those elements including the
 
04:13:28.670 --> 04:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
duplicate driver license have been
 
04:13:32.109 --> 04:13:32.119 align:start position:0%
developed um and uh they're expected to
 
04:13:35.670 --> 04:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
go live by June of 2021 uh there's
 
04:13:37.469 --> 04:13:37.479 align:start position:0%
additional development business
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
validation and go live for um the the
 
04:13:43.469 --> 04:13:43.479 align:start position:0%
driver uh restoration fee pay payments
 
04:13:45.309 --> 04:13:45.319 align:start position:0%
that's outstanding but will be expect to
 
04:13:47.469 --> 04:13:47.479 align:start position:0%
be completed by the end of December and
 
04:13:49.030 --> 04:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
then we have the design and pilot of
 
04:13:50.910 --> 04:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
electronic lean and title processing
 
04:13:54.550 --> 04:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:57.510 --> 04:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
project the next is a um records
 
04:14:00.149 --> 04:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
management system for uh the state
 
04:14:03.109 --> 04:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
police this is really their primary um
 
04:14:05.750 --> 04:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
piece of software that they record all
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
of their case management analytics
 
04:14:11.149 --> 04:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
reporting it also includes computerated
 
04:14:13.990 --> 04:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
dispatch functions this is in
 
04:14:16.830 --> 04:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
development and nearly complete um user
 
04:14:19.710 --> 04:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
acceptance testing is will be starting
 
04:14:21.710 --> 04:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
very shortly and training and
 
04:14:24.269 --> 04:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
implementation follow we're expecting a
 
04:14:29.550 --> 04:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:31.790 --> 04:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
implementation uh the next project is
 
04:14:35.870 --> 04:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
the n e911 Next Generation upgrade um
 
04:14:38.109 --> 04:14:38.119 align:start position:0%
this is to upgrade the state's 911
 
04:14:41.189 --> 04:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
system to uh the Next Generation
 
04:14:44.149 --> 04:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
standards and protocols uh that's a this
 
04:14:45.870 --> 04:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
is a long-term project it's a
 
04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
significant project um we've got large
 
04:14:50.429 --> 04:14:50.439 align:start position:0%
portions have been already completed
 
04:14:51.950 --> 04:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
successfully including upgrading the
 
04:14:54.269 --> 04:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
core Network um to meet the standards
 
04:14:56.910 --> 04:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
moving to an IP based network instead of
 
04:14:59.830 --> 04:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
just a plain old telephone line systems
 
04:15:01.830 --> 04:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
um but there's additional requirements
 
04:15:05.109 --> 04:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
to um standardize our GIS system that's
 
04:15:08.070 --> 04:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
the gra geographic information systems
 
04:15:10.750 --> 04:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
um and also call Handling Systems on how
 
04:15:12.309 --> 04:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
those calls come in and are handled
 
04:15:14.349 --> 04:15:14.359 align:start position:0%
within this with within the 911 system
 
04:15:16.990 --> 04:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
itself and the expected completion date
 
04:15:20.790 --> 04:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:25.429 --> 04:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
2022 um the next item is within lines 12
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
and 13 of the budget um this is already
 
04:15:32.670 --> 04:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
within uh hb25 so this isn't a this is
 
04:15:34.870 --> 04:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
this is language that's already existing
 
04:15:36.990 --> 04:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
and this would be to repurpose funds
 
04:15:39.910 --> 04:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
from an existing radio interoperability
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
project to the state police hanger
 
04:15:44.070 --> 04:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
project which was approved through the
 
04:15:48.070 --> 04:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
last bium um the the costs exceeded the
 
04:15:50.269 --> 04:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
original estimates uh for the State
 
04:15:52.910 --> 04:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
Police hanger um fortunately there are
 
04:15:54.630 --> 04:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
these funds available to us that we no
 
04:15:56.429 --> 04:15:56.439 align:start position:0%
longer need within the radio
 
04:15:58.189 --> 04:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
interoperability project and they're
 
04:16:00.389 --> 04:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
very close to what we need to complete
 
04:16:02.189 --> 04:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
the hangar project so if we repurpose
 
04:16:03.750 --> 04:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
These funds we believe we'll be
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
successful in completing that
 
04:16:10.389 --> 04:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
project um finally uh this last page
 
04:16:12.189 --> 04:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
goes back to the request for the
 
04:16:17.030 --> 04:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
committee um to to repurpose $74,000
 
04:16:19.349 --> 04:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
from the fire truck within the fire
 
04:16:21.510 --> 04:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
academy uh within the division of fire
 
04:16:23.590 --> 04:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
standards and training to repurpose that
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
to the fire academy hvap project um this
 
04:16:29.109 --> 04:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
is just some some proposed language uh
 
04:16:31.149 --> 04:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
that we believe would achieve that um
 
04:16:33.109 --> 04:16:33.119 align:start position:0%
but that's important for us to complete
 
04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise we won't be able to um to to
 
04:16:38.070 --> 04:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
complete the HVAC project we've already
 
04:16:39.510 --> 04:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
absorbed some of that cost with
 
04:16:41.590 --> 04:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
operating funds as I mentioned for the
 
04:16:43.269 --> 04:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
um for the exhaust system in the
 
04:16:45.670 --> 04:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
firehouse um but with this additional
 
04:16:47.910 --> 04:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
74,000 we believe that we can complete
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
the building maintenance system
 
04:16:52.550 --> 04:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
installation and upgrade as
 
04:16:55.149 --> 04:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
well and that concludes our presentation
 
04:16:56.550 --> 04:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
we'd be open for any questions that you
 
04:16:58.870 --> 04:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
may have so the way the repurpose is
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
going to work this is a fact finding
 
04:17:02.429 --> 04:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
committee uh not a decision-making
 
04:17:04.550 --> 04:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
committee so what we'll do is we'll
 
04:17:07.269 --> 04:17:07.279 align:start position:0%
bring forward the fact that you want the
 
04:17:09.790 --> 04:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
repurpose uh to the full committee uh
 
04:17:11.910 --> 04:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
and the language of course is helpful
 
04:17:13.750 --> 04:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
and the full committee will decide what
 
04:17:13.760 --> 04:17:14.710 align:start position:0%
and the full committee will decide what
to

04:17:14.710 --> 04:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
do very good we appreciate it and I see
 
04:17:20.670 --> 04:17:20.680 align:start position:0%
no questions uh was there anything
 
04:17:24.030 --> 04:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:29.550 --> 04:17:29.560 align:start position:0%
add uh no I think we're all set okay uh
 
04:17:34.030 --> 04:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
if that's the case we can unshare and uh
 
04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
04:17:39.309 --> 04:17:39.319 align:start position:0%

and then we'll on the final page we'll
 
04:40:36.390 --> 04:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
go into the the ones that will lapse um
 
04:40:38.230 --> 04:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
the first one is Enterprise workflow and
 
04:40:40.030 --> 04:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
document management uh that really had
 
04:40:42.590 --> 04:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
been intended to address a long-term
 
04:40:46.628 --> 04:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
need to improve the efficiency of State
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
operations by using workflow
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
technology uh we when we originally
 
04:40:55.270 --> 04:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
envisioned this appropriation to be
 
04:40:59.270 --> 04:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
using um primarily um General workflow
 
04:41:02.190 --> 04:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
Technologies like um Microsoft
 
04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
SharePoint but early on in the bium once
 
04:41:08.550 --> 04:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh we we worked with or we discovered
 
04:41:10.830 --> 04:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
that um the administrative Services
 
04:41:14.470 --> 04:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
folks had had some um an initiative to
 
04:41:16.948 --> 04:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
implement a contract related workflow
 
04:41:20.590 --> 04:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
inside our in4 Erp system some of you
 
04:41:23.948 --> 04:41:23.958 align:start position:0%
may know as of the Lawson Erp system so
 
04:41:26.310 --> 04:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
we we pivoted a little bit and worked
 
04:41:28.830 --> 04:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
with them on that uh initiative and and
 
04:41:31.150 --> 04:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
that was moving along and we actually
 
04:41:32.990 --> 04:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
had some you know we had a lot of
 
04:41:35.430 --> 04:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
progress on that and then the uh the
 
04:41:37.150 --> 04:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
purchase of property folks have been
 
04:41:39.230 --> 04:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
pretty diverted by Co they've been kind
 
04:41:43.270 --> 04:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
of full heads down on acquiring um stuff
 
04:41:46.830 --> 04:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
for covid response and recovery so uh we
 
04:41:48.750 --> 04:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
that project's been on hold for a number
 
04:41:51.230 --> 04:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
of months actually a year now right and
 
04:41:52.910 --> 04:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing we've been doing is
 
04:41:56.788 --> 04:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
piloting some some technologies with um
 
04:41:58.750 --> 04:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
agencies that would help them in their
 
04:42:02.070 --> 04:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
own workflow and um inside the Microsoft
 
04:42:05.628 --> 04:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
suite and that is in Pilot stage now and
 
04:42:07.470 --> 04:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
and and again we slowed down quite a bit
 
04:42:11.830 --> 04:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
by Co activities um but we do we do know
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
that and believe that we can Implement
 
04:42:16.390 --> 04:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
um improve our workflows another thing
 
04:42:18.628 --> 04:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
that did happen in in Co that that
 
04:42:20.310 --> 04:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
were're researching now in a couple
 
04:42:24.110 --> 04:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
agencies the use of workflow
 
04:42:27.550 --> 04:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
Technologies e signature has arisen and
 
04:42:29.430 --> 04:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
so we're we're also looking into that as
 
04:42:32.110 --> 04:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
a potential future thing so we would ask
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
that this this um committee grant us the
 
04:42:38.990 --> 04:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
ability to continue with this project um
 
04:42:40.750 --> 04:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
we I I believe we'd be a lot further
 
04:42:43.670 --> 04:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
along had we had we not kind of diverted
 
04:42:45.830 --> 04:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know late last or early last year
 
04:42:48.510 --> 04:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
into the co response and Recovery I do
 
04:42:50.550 --> 04:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
believe this money will be well spent if
 
04:42:52.070 --> 04:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
if it were the will of the committee to
 
04:42:53.350 --> 04:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
continue this
 
04:42:55.990 --> 04:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
one um Statewide
 
04:42:58.750 --> 04:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
archival this one's been again you can
 
04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
see from the datea on it's been moving
 
04:43:03.030 --> 04:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
fairly slowly there were really two
 
04:43:05.628 --> 04:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
primary parts of this uh I think the
 
04:43:07.708 --> 04:43:07.718 align:start position:0%
largest part from a legislative
 
04:43:11.270 --> 04:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
perspective was the the the the
 
04:43:14.350 --> 04:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
researching the uh potential use of
 
04:43:17.150 --> 04:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
technology to reduce square footage
 
04:43:19.708 --> 04:43:19.718 align:start position:0%
footprint for the state archist to the
 
04:43:21.868 --> 04:43:21.878 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office the second
 
04:43:26.628 --> 04:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
piece of This was um to to um look at
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
archival technology that would assist
 
04:43:31.190 --> 04:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
again in the efficient running of state
 
04:43:33.270 --> 04:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
government so we really had Envision
 
04:43:34.830 --> 04:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
getting some professional help in to
 
04:43:37.628 --> 04:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
help us um understand this better as
 
04:43:40.270 --> 04:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
well as um Implement some tools so we
 
04:43:42.070 --> 04:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
have implemented
 
04:43:44.150 --> 04:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
we have a small
 
04:43:46.868 --> 04:43:46.878 align:start position:0%
implementation pilot that we're in the
 
04:43:48.150 --> 04:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
middle of
 
04:43:51.390 --> 04:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
now and we continue to collaborate with
 
04:43:54.270 --> 04:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
the AR office but the you know they've
 
04:43:56.510 --> 04:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
been pretty focused on other things and
 
04:43:59.110 --> 04:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
and as we so again we haven't moved this
 
04:44:01.270 --> 04:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
along as quickly as I would have wanted
 
04:44:04.350 --> 04:44:04.360 align:start position:0%
to or expected to but again I do believe
 
04:44:07.270 --> 04:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
there's value to the state in continuing
 
04:44:10.470 --> 04:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
this I'll stop on this page and see if
 
04:44:12.670 --> 04:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
there's any question questions on that
 
04:44:14.670 --> 04:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead and continue there's no
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you um Enterprise G
 
04:44:22.590 --> 04:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
GIS alignment that was U I initially
 
04:44:27.750 --> 04:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
requested this um in uh in anticipation
 
04:44:31.350 --> 04:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
of a passage of Statute that is now RSA
 
04:44:35.550 --> 04:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
4f that created the gis committee um
 
04:44:38.150 --> 04:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
part of that we did create the committee
 
04:44:40.350 --> 04:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
and have been operating it ever since
 
04:44:41.910 --> 04:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
and we did
 
04:44:43.628 --> 04:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
come up with a number of initiatives
 
04:44:47.430 --> 04:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
that would that we would work on to um
 
04:44:49.708 --> 04:44:49.718 align:start position:0%
implement the legislative attent intent
 
04:44:50.990 --> 04:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
of RSA
 
04:44:54.390 --> 04:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
4f um and that really a quick there is
 
04:44:59.110 --> 04:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
to re the legislation act that we review
 
04:45:02.110 --> 04:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
the use and development and coordination
 
04:45:05.590 --> 04:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
of geospatial data resources across the
 
04:45:07.948 --> 04:45:07.958 align:start position:0%
state not just state government uh
 
04:45:09.470 --> 04:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
consider the need for
 
04:45:13.868 --> 04:45:13.878 align:start position:0%
centralization and ADV I on GIS needs um
 
04:45:17.868 --> 04:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
at public and semi-public agencies so
 
04:45:19.628 --> 04:45:19.638 align:start position:0%
what we've done there is initially we
 
04:45:21.030 --> 04:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
came up with a gap
 
04:45:24.190 --> 04:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
analysis um and the gaps where we're
 
04:45:25.830 --> 04:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
looking now you know what are we doing
 
04:45:29.750 --> 04:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
now and how does that not um act on
 
04:45:31.830 --> 04:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
legislative intent and we've done a lot
 
04:45:34.230 --> 04:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
of good things um I I could go into
 
04:45:35.670 --> 04:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
those but in the interest of time I
 
04:45:38.628 --> 04:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
won't but um we have proceeded pretty
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
far down the path of implementing
 
04:45:44.350 --> 04:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
legislative intent for RSA 4f and we're
 
04:45:47.110 --> 04:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
nearly out of money um sometime in the
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
future we may need more but um right now
 
04:45:52.150 --> 04:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
I think we're in good shape for another
 
04:45:55.270 --> 04:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
couple of years and we do intend to to
 
04:45:58.310 --> 04:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh use the remainder of this balance um
 
04:46:00.070 --> 04:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
right now the large project that's going
 
04:46:04.230 --> 04:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
on is a um a lot of the um work we've
 
04:46:08.430 --> 04:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
done in G in collaboration with the uh
 
04:46:11.590 --> 04:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
Granite which is a UNH um
 
04:46:14.030 --> 04:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
entity they've had for years a public
 
04:46:18.390 --> 04:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
wearing hous bis data and we was getting
 
04:46:19.868 --> 04:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
very long in the tooth and it wasn't
 
04:46:22.628 --> 04:46:22.638 align:start position:0%
very citizen friendly so we're we're
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
expanding on that as well as working
 
04:46:30.948 --> 04:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
more um with uh entities uh Municipal
 
04:46:34.310 --> 04:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
entities and other entities to um
 
04:46:36.350 --> 04:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
collaborate more on standardization of
 
04:46:39.910 --> 04:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
GIS resources across the state so I
 
04:46:42.510 --> 04:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
would ask that this be continued as well
 
04:46:44.868 --> 04:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
and the final is uh digital government
 
04:46:47.350 --> 04:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
trans transformation this was really the
 
04:46:50.110 --> 04:46:50.120 align:start position:0%
real intent of this originally and and
 
04:46:53.548 --> 04:46:53.558 align:start position:0%
remains was to improve our ability to
 
04:46:56.030 --> 04:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
deliver CI services and provide access
 
04:46:58.788 --> 04:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
to information to Citizens through our
 
04:47:00.990 --> 04:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
digital Government properties websites
 
04:47:03.070 --> 04:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
and applications that are projected out
 
04:47:06.110 --> 04:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
to Citizens and businesses of the state
 
04:47:10.230 --> 04:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
um we we have implemented um Statewide
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
content man management and hosting
 
04:47:15.948 --> 04:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
system and standardized templates for um
 
04:47:18.590 --> 04:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
for All State agencies although although
 
04:47:20.270 --> 04:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to implement them
 
04:47:23.830 --> 04:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
for All State agencies because again um
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
we pivoted very quickly to covid-19 work
 
04:47:30.910 --> 04:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
in this area um now it's a good thing we
 
04:47:32.510 --> 04:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
it turns out it's a good thing we did
 
04:47:36.070 --> 04:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
this because the volumes on our websites
 
04:47:39.310 --> 04:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
in covid-19 have been uh above and
 
04:47:41.510 --> 04:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
beyond anything we've ever seen before
 
04:47:43.868 --> 04:47:43.878 align:start position:0%
particularly after a press conference a
 
04:47:47.270 --> 04:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
governor press conference and so um but
 
04:47:49.070 --> 04:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
if you're interested in seeing some of
 
04:47:51.990 --> 04:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
the results of this uh two good places
 
04:47:53.750 --> 04:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
to go look would be the Department of
 
04:47:56.270 --> 04:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
Education website and the Department of
 
04:47:58.190 --> 04:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services website and you
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
could contrast them against say the
 
04:48:03.430 --> 04:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections website for
 
04:48:04.948 --> 04:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
example which is kind of more of the
 
04:48:07.548 --> 04:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
older style and see the types of things
 
04:48:12.110 --> 04:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
that that have been done so again we
 
04:48:14.110 --> 04:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten as far along as we'd like
 
04:48:17.910 --> 04:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
to and and that reflects in in the spend
 
04:48:21.270 --> 04:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
there also we did a lot of covid website
 
04:48:24.750 --> 04:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
work with this new um with this new
 
04:48:26.788 --> 04:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
ability but a lot of that was paid for
 
04:48:29.350 --> 04:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
with cares act money so again it didn't
 
04:48:31.948 --> 04:48:31.958 align:start position:0%
it didn't diminish the um the balance on
 
04:48:34.830 --> 04:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:37.948 --> 04:48:37.958 align:start position:0%
appropriation any questions on this
 
04:48:41.070 --> 04:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
page okay continuity of operations is
 
04:48:44.430 --> 04:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
recovery planning um just recently um
 
04:48:46.270 --> 04:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
contract was approved by the executive
 
04:48:50.390 --> 04:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
Council to uh to bring in a company do a
 
04:48:53.470 --> 04:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
a full assessment of our Disaster
 
04:48:57.030 --> 04:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
Recovery uh posture as well as help us
 
04:48:59.310 --> 04:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
rewrite the doit continuity of
 
04:49:01.868 --> 04:49:01.878 align:start position:0%
operations plan um
 
04:49:05.470 --> 04:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
so and you will you may remember that
 
04:49:07.270 --> 04:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
and and we had envisioned this as a
 
04:49:10.110 --> 04:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
two-step process one by enum we do the
 
04:49:12.110 --> 04:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
analysis we bring in professionals to do
 
04:49:14.788 --> 04:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
the analysis the next bium we start
 
04:49:17.548 --> 04:49:17.558 align:start position:0%
acting on the findings so you'll you you
 
04:49:19.030 --> 04:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
may remember that there's a
 
04:49:22.350 --> 04:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
appropriation request in for this bium
 
04:49:25.470 --> 04:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
to begin to act on the findings of this
 
04:49:29.830 --> 04:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
now certainly the our dependence on our
 
04:49:33.788 --> 04:49:33.798 align:start position:0%
state it resources um continues to grow
 
04:49:36.510 --> 04:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
even outside of the massive increase
 
04:49:36.520 --> 04:49:37.628 align:start position:0%
even outside of the massive increase
that

04:49:37.628 --> 04:49:37.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:40.868 --> 04:49:40.878 align:start position:0%
covid-19 provided so I think this is a
 
04:49:42.788 --> 04:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
important for the state this is nearly
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
expended now and and will be um by the
 
04:49:49.628 --> 04:49:49.638 align:start position:0%
end of uh likely by the end of this bium
 
04:49:51.030 --> 04:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
early early
 
04:49:53.830 --> 04:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
next and then cyber security and program
 
04:49:57.590 --> 04:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
enhancements um we did um what we had
 
04:50:00.708 --> 04:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
expected to do on this program um in
 
04:50:03.190 --> 04:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
this bium despite the fact that we were
 
04:50:06.270 --> 04:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
pretty heavily diverted by a number of
 
04:50:10.750 --> 04:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
things the largest thing was our um
 
04:50:12.750 --> 04:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
independent cyber security risk
 
04:50:15.868 --> 04:50:15.878 align:start position:0%
assessment and the um and addressing the
 
04:50:20.030 --> 04:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
findings of same so we had a a really um
 
04:50:22.230 --> 04:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
deep and wide assessment of our cyber
 
04:50:23.868 --> 04:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
security posture that
 
04:50:27.628 --> 04:50:27.638 align:start position:0%
involves um you know but all of our
 
04:50:29.788 --> 04:50:29.798 align:start position:0%
infrastructure a good part of it as well
 
04:50:31.670 --> 04:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
as many of the applications important
 
04:50:35.390 --> 04:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
applications that we run um one public
 
04:50:37.788 --> 04:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
facing result of that and some of you
 
04:50:40.190 --> 04:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
may this may have impacted you was that
 
04:50:42.910 --> 04:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
we actually had to bring down um
 
04:50:46.230 --> 04:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services uh One-Stop web
 
04:50:48.030 --> 04:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh web applications for a while because
 
04:50:49.868 --> 04:50:49.878 align:start position:0%
we found some pretty serious cyber risks
 
04:50:51.470 --> 04:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
there that we had to mitigate before
 
04:50:53.750 --> 04:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
bringing them up so we felt really bad
 
04:50:55.350 --> 04:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
about that because we were affecting
 
04:50:57.150 --> 04:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
again citizens and businesses of New
 
04:50:59.590 --> 04:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but the first the first
 
04:51:01.548 --> 04:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
priority really is to protect the data
 
04:51:03.470 --> 04:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
of of the citizens and businesses and so
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
we did that there um based on based on
 
04:51:10.070 --> 04:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
the current situation we're in and the
 
04:51:12.628 --> 04:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
dangers that we're seeing in in the
 
04:51:15.430 --> 04:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
world um where we have a couple things
 
04:51:17.310 --> 04:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
we'd like to do with the remainder of
 
04:51:21.670 --> 04:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
those funds one is to uh create a uh a
 
04:51:24.150 --> 04:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
set of campaigns that help train state
 
04:51:28.788 --> 04:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
employees on um how not to get the state
 
04:51:31.750 --> 04:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
Network ransomed basically is to be very
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
explicit with that the ransomware is a
 
04:51:36.070 --> 04:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
huge danger and you may some of you may
 
04:51:38.430 --> 04:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
have seen it in your own communities
 
04:51:40.948 --> 04:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
where um you know we've seen a lot of uh
 
04:51:43.150 --> 04:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
municipal government and and safety
 
04:51:45.430 --> 04:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
entities in New Hampshire get ransomed
 
04:51:47.708 --> 04:51:47.718 align:start position:0%
over the past two or three years um
 
04:51:49.350 --> 04:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
we've been lucky at it in the state of
 
04:51:52.230 --> 04:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and careful but um I think
 
04:51:54.830 --> 04:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
that the the criminals are getting
 
04:51:56.270 --> 04:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
better and better at doing this and we
 
04:51:59.868 --> 04:51:59.878 align:start position:0%
need to up our game in this um and then
 
04:52:03.788 --> 04:52:03.798 align:start position:0%
the the second part is um uh to assist
 
04:52:06.948 --> 04:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
us with the final configuration ofet
 
04:52:09.788 --> 04:52:09.798 align:start position:0%
discoveries solution which was funded in
 
04:52:12.310 --> 04:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
already had been funded in this
 
04:52:14.548 --> 04:52:14.558 align:start position:0%
appropriation so we would ask that that
 
04:52:18.150 --> 04:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
be moved forward as well and we we do
 
04:52:21.110 --> 04:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
expect that to be completed pretty
 
04:52:24.350 --> 04:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
soon any questions here no questions I
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
don't see anything so far all right well
 
04:52:31.350 --> 04:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
I know that sometimes lapses agreeing to
 
04:52:33.270 --> 04:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
lapse something is can be exciting if
 
04:52:35.470 --> 04:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
there's any money left but we will lapse
 
04:52:37.270 --> 04:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
all these but there really isn't a lot
 
04:52:39.910 --> 04:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
there but this is the ones that will
 
04:52:46.030 --> 04:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
fall off our our books uh effective
 
04:52:50.310 --> 04:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:54.110 --> 04:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
Anyan okay that's it I see no questions
 
04:52:57.510 --> 04:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh was there anything that you wanted to
 
04:53:00.150 --> 04:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
add no just thank thank you for
 
04:53:01.628 --> 04:53:01.638 align:start position:0%
consideration if you think of any
 
04:53:03.470 --> 04:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
questions feel free to reach out we'll
 
04:53:04.708 --> 04:53:04.718 align:start position:0%

move our next Agency on
 
04:53:14.590 --> 04:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
here our next agency is the Liquor
 
04:53:21.070 --> 04:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:24.868 --> 04:53:24.878 align:start position:0%

would like to move forward can we take a
 
04:54:08.510 --> 04:54:08.520 align:start position:0%

there um on page two is um the uh next
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
gen project which we're currently in the
 
04:54:31.430 --> 04:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
middle of um design and development and
 
04:54:34.430 --> 04:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
starting testing we're looking to go
 
04:54:37.030 --> 04:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
live with that project at the end of
 
04:54:38.430 --> 04:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
this calendar
 
04:54:42.270 --> 04:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
year if you want to go go
 
04:54:44.270 --> 04:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
to page
 
04:54:47.830 --> 04:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
five or at page six that's our Hampton
 
04:54:51.868 --> 04:54:51.878 align:start position:0%
North and South project we are currently
 
04:54:54.070 --> 04:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
um have gone out to bid and and
 
04:54:59.590 --> 04:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
initiated a contract to um sell the
 
04:55:05.030 --> 04:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
property we are going to do a um selling
 
04:55:07.030 --> 04:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the property and using the funds that
 
04:55:09.310 --> 04:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
we received for that to pay down our
 
04:55:09.320 --> 04:55:10.990 align:start position:0%
we received for that to pay down our
debt

04:55:10.990 --> 04:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
debt
 
04:55:14.390 --> 04:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
we have the project on page 10 which is
 
04:55:16.750 --> 04:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
our conquered um it says roof
 
04:55:19.548 --> 04:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
replacement and parking lot our roof is
 
04:55:22.190 --> 04:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
complete but we had to delay our Park
 
04:55:24.110 --> 04:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
parking lot we put that project on hold
 
04:55:26.470 --> 04:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
and we're looking to back up to bid um
 
04:55:28.708 --> 04:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
to start that
 
04:55:33.750 --> 04:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
project and then on page 11 are our laps
 
04:55:36.390 --> 04:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
projects there's the uh Chesterfield
 
04:55:39.390 --> 04:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
store expansion we're lapsing 288,000
 
04:55:40.750 --> 04:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
for that one
 
04:55:42.470 --> 04:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
our signage and branding will be done at
 
04:55:44.430 --> 04:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
this end of this uh fiscal year but
 
04:55:46.110 --> 04:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
there will be no funds available in that
 
04:55:49.070 --> 04:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
one there's our conquered roof which has
 
04:55:52.150 --> 04:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
completed there'll be about 490,000 in
 
04:55:55.030 --> 04:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
that one and then our Portsmouth store
 
04:55:57.628 --> 04:55:57.638 align:start position:0%
at the Portsmith traffic circle we will
 
04:56:00.670 --> 04:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
be um lapsing back about 1.1 million in
 
04:56:00.680 --> 04:56:01.470 align:start position:0%
be um lapsing back about 1.1 million in

04:56:57.510 --> 04:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
mistake uh please let me know and Mr
 
04:57:00.788 --> 04:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
Shay uh yeah thank you representative uh
 
04:57:03.548 --> 04:57:03.558 align:start position:0%
Jack so what I'm what I've been working
 
04:57:06.990 --> 04:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
on is compiling the um potential
 
04:57:08.590 --> 04:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
projects that you can repurpose and I
 
04:57:10.708 --> 04:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
think we mentioned earlier that there
 
04:57:12.788 --> 04:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
are some that agencies are bringing
 
04:57:15.310 --> 04:57:15.320 align:start position:0%
forward that haven't had laps extensions
 
04:57:17.788 --> 04:57:17.798 align:start position:0%
in any of the capital budgets for one or
 
04:57:21.030 --> 04:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
two or maybe more by enums and in the
 
04:57:23.150 --> 04:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
past practice you haven't tried to
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
repurpose those
 
04:57:26.910 --> 04:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
dollars and I've got a question out to
 
04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
the comp troller if it's even um
 
04:57:30.788 --> 04:57:30.798 align:start position:0%
something that could happen if there was
 
04:57:33.788 --> 04:57:33.798 align:start position:0%
never a lapse extension provided right
 
04:57:35.390 --> 04:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
so what happens with as we discussed
 
04:57:37.310 --> 04:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
with Environmental Services sometimes an
 
04:57:39.470 --> 04:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
agency encumbers the full amount they
 
04:57:42.230 --> 04:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
finish the a few years later and there's
 
04:57:44.868 --> 04:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
a few dollars left they didn't need a
 
04:57:47.270 --> 04:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
laps extension because it was
 
04:57:49.788 --> 04:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
encumbered now the money comes out and
 
04:57:52.270 --> 04:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
and it's there's been nothing that said
 
04:57:53.670 --> 04:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
hey there's laps there and you can do
 
04:57:55.910 --> 04:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
something with it so at this point I was
 
04:57:58.548 --> 04:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
um not including that in any of the
 
04:58:02.070 --> 04:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
totals that I had put together so far
 
04:58:05.470 --> 04:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
but based on what I've heard agencies
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:12.910 --> 04:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
um let me just get my screen up
 
04:58:16.390 --> 04:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
here there's there's about $2.2 million
 
04:58:19.750 --> 04:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
in dollar that you could repurpose yeah
 
04:58:22.110 --> 04:58:22.120 align:start position:0%
the administrative Services was was a
 
04:58:24.628 --> 04:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
nice windfall with the uh money from the
 
04:58:24.638 --> 04:58:25.990 align:start position:0%
nice windfall with the uh money from the
marac

04:58:25.990 --> 04:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
marac
 
04:58:29.350 --> 04:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
court yep um so they they were a big one
 
04:58:32.510 --> 04:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services with their
 
04:58:35.030 --> 04:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
$161,000 um there's a Department of
 
04:58:37.470 --> 04:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
Education had
 
04:58:39.708 --> 04:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um they wen't an agency that
 
04:58:42.350 --> 04:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
came in but their documentation provided
 
04:58:42.360 --> 04:58:44.230 align:start position:0%
came in but their documentation provided
that

04:58:44.230 --> 04:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:58:47.230 --> 04:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
information um so yeah but you know so
 
04:58:49.830 --> 04:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
so there's a fair amount of money there
 
04:58:51.350 --> 04:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
um and and I'll share this with you
 
04:58:53.110 --> 04:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative Jackson as you prepare
 
04:58:56.548 --> 04:58:56.558 align:start position:0%

04:58:58.830 --> 04:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
share back with the committee okay just
 
04:59:00.548 --> 04:59:00.558 align:start position:0%
wanted the committee to know when you
 
04:59:02.390 --> 04:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
see the information I have it's only
 
04:59:03.948 --> 04:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
those projects that I can find the laps
 
04:59:06.510 --> 04:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
extension in 2019 okay so you're going
 
04:59:08.868 --> 04:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
to send me that and I'll I'll cross
