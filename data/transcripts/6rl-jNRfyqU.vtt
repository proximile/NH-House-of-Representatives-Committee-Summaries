00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.830 align:start position:0%
okay
good

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
morning what do we do got uh HB
 
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
1033 we have the sponsor
 
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
here and repr Gart
 
00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
here I would say right out of the block
 
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
I noticed that it's in the wrong
 
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
RSA okay I don't know it was you told
 
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
them which RSA to be in or did you I
 
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
took the professional advice of
 
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
OSS and uh unfortunately we have a lot
 
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
of new people there okay go ahead thank
 
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
you good morning committee
 
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
representative Jason Gard representing
 
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
Northfield Franklin M Mike
 
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
25 this bill quite simply prohibits the
 
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
advertising of nominal dimensions of
 
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
lumber as some may or may not be aware a
 
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
2x4 that you buy in the store is not
 
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
actually 2 in by 4 in it's 1 and 1/2 by
 
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
3 and 1/2 and similarly
 
00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 align:start position:0%
other Lumber is not what it is actually
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
represented to
 
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
be so for some examples let's say a 2X
 
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 align:start position:0%
12 it's 1 and 1/2 by 11 and A4 which
 
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
might seem minimal but let's go back to
 
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
the 2x4 that's a 25% reduction in what
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
you're actually buying so if you were to
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
buy a gallon of milk and you get three
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
quarts you would be pretty upset and
 
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.749 align:start position:0%
quarts you would be pretty upset and
rightfully

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
rightfully
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
so the reason I brought this bill
 
00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 align:start position:0%
forward is because I'm a carpenter and I
 
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
work with wood all day long and I think
 
00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
you should tell the truth and what
 
00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 align:start position:0%
you're selling and it just simply puts
 
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
everybody on a Level Playing Field so
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
you know what you're getting and you can
 
00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
compare easily the I'm I'm assuming one
 
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
of the arguments is that this is because
 
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's plain Down Smooth etc etc but when
 
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
you go to a rough cut lumber yard they
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
figured out the magical way of cutting a
 
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
2x4 to 2 in by 4 in if they were to so
 
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
choose to plane it down then advertise
 
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
it as
 
00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
such I I it doesn't it doesn't seem that
 
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
complicated me to tell the truth and the
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
Bible tells us to tell the truth when it
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
comes to weights and measures so
 
00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 align:start position:0%
Deuteronomy 25 13-16 you shall have you
 
00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
shall not have in your bag differing
 
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
weights a heavy and a light you shall
 
00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 align:start position:0%
not have in your house differing
 
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
measures a large and a small you shall
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
have a perfect and just measure that
 
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
your days may be lengthened in the land
 
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
which the Lord your God is giving you
 
00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
and there other there other passages but
 
00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.230 align:start position:0%
and there other there other passages but
it's

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
basic truth that you should let people
 
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
know what you're selling so I don't know
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
to me it just seems very simple so maybe
 
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
I'm oversimplifying it um just a couple
 
00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
more examples your deck boards they call
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
them five quarter on your deck they're
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
actually one inch I don't even know what
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
five quarter um and plywood is minimally
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
off so half inch is really 15 30 seconds
 
00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 align:start position:0%
and 3/4s 23 30 seconds so that's pretty
 
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
minimal but still it's not right I'll
 
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
take any questions hopefully I can
 
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
answer them and yeah thank
 
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
you repr represent Aon
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 align:start position:0%
frequent flyer with frequent flyer miles
 
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
at Home Depot myself uh have you ever
 
00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:11.879 align:start position:0%
looked at the so where they very clearly
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
label the nominal dimensions and the
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
actual dimensions on what they're
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
selling MH so I could it it in my it
 
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
explain to me how this is different if I
 
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
go into a store and ask for a cola and
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
they give me a coke that the coal is the
 
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
generic name but I get a Coke and so
 
00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:36.919 align:start position:0%
when I go into Home Depot and I buy a
 
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
piece of five quter board which I am
 
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
well advised of the fact that it's not
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
five qus of an
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
inch and they have it they say they
 
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
don't even call it five quarter board
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
there but if I get a piece of five quter
 
00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:50.919 align:start position:0%
board trim they've clearly marked what
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
the actual dimensions are so is this a
 
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
labeling issue that you want stores to
 
00:07:59.469 --> 00:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
label because in the case of most Lumber
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
yards that I'm familiar with in my area
 
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
they they do label it that way or is
 
00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:07.639 align:start position:0%
this something you want to go back to
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
warehousing I'm not exactly sure you're
 
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
saying at the retail point the retail I
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
would say at the point of sale it should
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
say what you're buying does but it does
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
in these little itty bitty things when
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
you look online 2x4 it comes up and you
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
have to go into the specifications and
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
actually say oh oh there's the actual I
 
00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
don't understand why we need that second
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
hurdle it just doesn't make any sense to
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
me that's what I'm trying to get at if
 
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
you have a product it's like saying this
 
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:31.720 align:start position:0%
is a yard but it's 2 feet no it's not a
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
yard it's 2 feet so but the little sign
 
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
in the fine print says this I I don't
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
see the necessity for it I'm
 
00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
just okay fair enough re
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
H thank you for uh bringing this bill to
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
us it's a an interesting topic that you
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
brought up here um so I was always
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
taught uh you measure twice and you cut
 
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
once right so in that double measuring
 
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
you would find out the actual dimensions
 
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
of the board uh the way the way I was
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
told uh the reason for that is the raw
 
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
Lumber is 2 in and the width of the saw
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
is what knocks it down to less than two
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
inches uh is that your understanding I
 
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
don't believe that to be true because
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
then why would be variations happen so
 
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
for instance 2x4 1 and a half by 3 and a
 
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
half but now when you're doing the 2 x
 
00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
12 it's only 11 and a quarter you know
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
what I mean it's not following the same
 
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.829 align:start position:0%
what I mean it's not following the same
rate

00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
so we can
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just going to stick with what I
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
initially said if you're selling
 
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
something say what you're selling
 
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise don't say it it just I I think
 
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty much basic principle but
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm missing something okay
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
representa M thanks Mr chairman
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
philosophically we probably agree in
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
truth and advertising but on the Shelf
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
Edge price would you believe like the
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
the Shelf Edge I think that's the fine
 
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
print you're talking about at Home Depot
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
I've also noticed that it does say the
 
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.350 align:start position:0%
I've also noticed that it does say the
actual

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
actual
 
00:09:59.310 --> 00:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
dimensions and I'm guessing saying and
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you have any insight
 
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
they do that because of the average
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
uneducated home DIY consumer like me
 
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
that years ago may have thought I was
 
00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
buying a 2x4 but they put it to make
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
sure I don't have to return it or I
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
don't get it you know I don't get it
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
wrong well I think they already label it
 
00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
do they okay I didn't want to cut you
 
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
off actually there was a lawsuit so
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
somebody sued was it Lowe's and Home
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
whatever I think it was Lowe's and Home
 
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
Depot but they sued them saying that
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
they weren't sold the right wood and
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah and that's what that led
 
00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:34.839 align:start position:0%
to a lot more of the explicit
 
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
advertising of
 
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:40.519 align:start position:0%
such um I okay going back to what we're
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
saying with do
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
yourselfers I think we should be
 
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to do more work on
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
their houses and I I don't it's I would
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
say it's kind of similar to the whole
 
00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:52.839 align:start position:0%
lawyer I'd say scam but this legal ease
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
that most people don't understand so
 
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
we've created this separate language
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
that only the select understand now I
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
understand it's a minimal thing but
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
still shouldn't we all be speaking the
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
same language and when it comes to math
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
I yeah I don't know just seem so
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
straightforward it's hard to explain
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
when it's so representative Burrows
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question beyond the
 
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
lawsuit what evidence is there that this
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
is a problem that this is a problem for
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
people I would say not telling the truth
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
is a problem for everyone but do you
 
00:11:25.949 --> 00:11:25.959 align:start position:0%
have any other evidence to back it how
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
do you know that that the consumers are
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
having a problem with this oh well I
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
mean if you could go that angle it would
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
be in that lawsuit they brought some
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
evidence forward they did some kind of
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
poll or something and the vast majority
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
of people don't know that a 2x4 is not
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
actually 2x4 who they PLL I don't know
 
00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
maybe it's you know elementary school
 
00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
kids I don't know but the point being is
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
most people actually don't realize that
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
because most people don't work on their
 
00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:48.519 align:start position:0%
houses which I think is a really bad
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
thing I think well this a philosophical
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
thing I think you should build your own
 
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
house in a way because but yeah anyway
 
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a deeper well I mean it
 
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
would it would make you appreciate it
 
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.829 --> 00:12:04.839 align:start position:0%
anyway okay so oh we got more yes
 
00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:06.069 align:start position:0%
anyway okay so oh we got more yes
represent

00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
Spar I I've lived in a number of states
 
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
and I've seen these kind of measurements
 
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
everywhere I've lived and I do do I
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
don't my husband does a lot of work on
 
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
the houses that we've lived in and it
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
seems like it's a standard everywhere
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
we've lived to do this is this an
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
industry standard that they put the
 
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
measurements out that
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
way yes I mean Home Depot and lows are
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
international so not no long before
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
either one of them even started it's an
 
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
industry standard it's an industry
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
standard for the 1930s okay thank
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
you yeah so I guess I'd pick up there um
 
00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:47.959 align:start position:0%
the only time we've ever had a bill
 
00:12:51.069 --> 00:12:51.079 align:start position:0%
similar to your subject matter was um
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
Gary Daniels brought in when he was in
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
ref before was Senator but he brought in
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
a bill that was I didn't like the fact
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
that gas stations always charged that
 
00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
you know that's
 
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.389 align:start position:0%
you know that's
[Music]

00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
2999 and he says well where's this 0.9 I
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
me you can't do 0.9 I mean 0.9 doesn't
 
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
exist but you know it's truth and
 
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
adverti let's fix this up and the end of
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
the day the problem is is that you're
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
actually going to create more
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
confusion if you were to pass this bill
 
00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
because that for everyone
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
who's ever stumbled into a lumber ever
 
00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
bought a
 
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
2x4 and maybe the very first time you
 
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
bought it you say boy that's annoying
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
that that 2x4 is not a
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
2x4 okay but it's just that's what it's
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
called and so what I'm going to ask you
 
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
is is think about it's not that that
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
they're being untruthful about what
 
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
they're selling because they're selling
 
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
their marketing it is is this is what
 
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
everybody thinks a 2x4 looks like that's
 
00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:00.759 align:start position:0%
when if I go in for a 2X four I if I
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
haven't learned the first time I'll
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
learn soon enough that a 2x4 is not
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
truly a 2x4 unless I go buy it from my
 
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
next door neighbor Brian Damon who has
 
00:14:14.189 --> 00:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
raw Lumber and and it really is truly a
 
00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:17.959 align:start position:0%
2x4 I would I would simply say
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
that just okay the fact that something
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
goes on for a long time that's not
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
truthful doesn't make it truthful so I
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
would go back to let's say we go back to
 
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
the 30s for a second in the black Law
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
Dictionary dollar is defined as 120th an
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
ounce of gold now you need $2,000 or
 
00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:34.519 align:start position:0%
more I don't even know what the rate is
 
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
right now to buy a dollar you know for
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
the equivalent goal
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
so to me telling the truth is important
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
not that I've always done it I've made
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
mistakes like all but I think getting
 
00:14:49.749 --> 00:14:49.759 align:start position:0%
back to just simple math I mean okay we
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
haven't done this in a long time people
 
00:14:52.749 --> 00:14:52.759 align:start position:0%
will be confused well you know what
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
being confused by the truth isn't being
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
confused now you know the truth so
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's all I gonna say on that and uh
 
00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
yeah fair enough any other questions
 
00:15:03.399 --> 00:15:04.949 align:start position:0%
yeah fair enough any other questions
representative

00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:07.959 align:start position:0%
pelli I would be more interested in what
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
am I paying for so do you find that
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
there are pricing issues so everything
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
now is shrinkage right you don't get a
 
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
package of Oreos everything is shrunk so
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
is there an issue with the pricing
 
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
because they the boards are not actually
 
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
2x4s and they're charging you for 2x4 is
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
that a concern at all no I mean I I
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
don't even know how to answer that I
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
would just say that if as before just if
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
you're selling X have it to be X don't
 
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
so you need get the uh the c number you
 
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
questions okay great thank you thank
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:10.519 align:start position:0%
you okay okay the actual product
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
thickness is
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
really one and a half right right three
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
and a half right exactly so so it's
 
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:23.560 align:start position:0%

internationally in fact New Hampshire we
 
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
have one of the largest Lumber trading
 
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
houses in nasua Seaboard International
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
one of the largest in the in the world
 
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
trading internationally softwood Lumber
 
00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:42.919 align:start position:0%
and so you know to for New Hampshire and
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
we all love the state we all you know
 
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
it's important but if we were to create
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
our own Lumber standard the disruption
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
that would occur not only domestically
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
but potentially internationally if
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
you're trading uh 1x4s or 2x4s out of
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
the out of a New Hampshire Sawmill um
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be problematic
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
for us the other piece is we do
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
represent we do have members that have
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
portable sawmills representative MCU
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
actually had a chance to see one at our
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
annual meeting last year um and you know
 
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
I asked them about this bill and one of
 
00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:24.919 align:start position:0%
the things they had told me you know
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
some concerns they raised is that you
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
know they'll sell green l
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
it is a solid 2 in by 4 in and the
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
expectation is as Lumber dries you're
 
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
going to get some shrinkage but also
 
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to um if you plan it when
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
you go to plan it you also so this this
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
concept of a nominal a nominal uh
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
Dimension takes into consideration those
 
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
facts that you have green Lumber yes at
 
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
one point in time it was in fact 2 in by
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
4 in it gets dried you get shrinkage
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
it also when you go to plane it um you
 
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
also see a reduction as well I'm going
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
to conclude my testimony at that um only
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
just you know saying that we don't think
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
this is necessary we think it would be
 
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
incredibly disruptive and unnecessary
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
for the industry we've done pretty well
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
trading our lumber domestically and
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
internationally with the nominal um oh
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
one last point was the way as drafted
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
this also
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
includes um Timber if you list it's it's
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
not just Lumber we're not just talking
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
about the rack at Home Depot um as
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
drafted it includes Timber and other
 
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
Forest Products and I wanted to before I
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
lose the M logs Timber and other wood
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
products and when I her purchase Timber
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
we think of that as standing Timber I go
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
in and cruise up an individual's wood
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
lot I give them an estimate of what's
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
out there obviously I don't measure
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely every single tree and say yes
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
to the to the you know to the decimal
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
point this is how many board feet this
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
is how many cords and this is how many
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
tons of these different products and so
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
that was another piece that some of our
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
actually Foresters and loggers had
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
raised is that if I'm buying in Timber
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
how would this affect me likewise we've
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
all many of you have probably purchased
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
cords of firewood 4et by 4 feet by 8T
 
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
well I can tell you I can stack a quart
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
of firewood 4 feet by 4 feet by
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
8T um my kids when they go to stack it
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
it's not 4 feet by 4 feet by 8 feet it's
 
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
usually off a little bit and it's just
 
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
how the pieces fit together again if I'm
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
selling firewood by the core Bo again
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
this kind
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
of affects that as well so with that
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
I'll conclude my testimony I'm happy to
 
00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
you do we have regulations now on
 
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
cordwood in the 4x4 by8 is that in our
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
statute now yes we do the the New
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Agriculture has
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
that they they and they do in fact
 
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
regulate that okay I knew that I knew
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
that but I just wanted you to say you
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
tested me
 
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
good repres ter so I I realize that the
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
bill is is focused at the at the at the
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
retail sales point and um and you know
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
what are what are the the actual
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
dimensions of a tu four at in in Home
 
00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
Depot but I just want to be
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
clear um about what I thought I heard
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
you say so did you say that when a 2x4
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
is is MIL it's actually it's actually M
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
at 2x4 and then it shrinks
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
and so when I go to Home Depot it's
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
already shrunk yeah the the just want to
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
be clear yeah so so so when I the folks
 
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
that I talk
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
to that piece of lumber that you've
 
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
purchased at Home Depot has it was
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
originally 2 in by 4 in it goes through
 
00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
a dry Kiln it gets
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
dried it shrinks and then it'll go
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
through a planer that Smooths it out so
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
it's nice and smooth and you have those
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
rounded corners and so at that point you
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
get these that's why you'll have these
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
nominal um and again you can buy from a
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
local local uh you know uh portable
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
sawmill and they can actually they'll
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
they'll saw whatever you want they'll
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
saw five quarter they'll saw four
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
quarter eight quarter for the question
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
so if I were to summarize what I think
 
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing you say uh a 2x4 is what it
 
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
was not what it is any longer at the
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
retail level it's what it was but it's
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
not what it is I guess that's a good way
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
of putting it great thank you
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
thanks it does say kill dry sometimes
 
00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:14.919 align:start position:0%
they say kill dry and you got to assume
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
that putting it through the kilm is
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
going to make it drink a little bit Yeah
 
00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
Yeah Lumber starts out about 50% water
 
00:23:22.039 --> 00:23:23.669 align:start position:0%
Yeah Lumber starts out about 50% water
okay

00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking our questions um
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
to me this would you believe this this
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
sounds like like the original version of
 
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
shrink flation so we're familiar when we
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
go to the grocery store that the
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
packaging might be the same size but the
 
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
contents have shrunk magically right so
 
00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
um I think this is uh I appreciate would
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
you believe I appreciate the uh the
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative bringing this to our
 
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
attention um this is sort of like a
 
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
maybe a little white lie that we've
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
gotten used to and uh we all kind of you
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
know have adjusted to it and uh it may
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
cause more disruption if we if we undo
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
it but I would believe
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
that okay we oh representative Cole has
 
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
a question what would be the cost
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
increase of lumber if something like
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
this was implemented oh my God it it
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
would be it would
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
be it would be significant if you think
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
about you know these Lumber Mills having
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
to maintain two sets of inventory
 
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.350 align:start position:0%
to maintain two sets of inventory
shipping

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
shipping
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
labeling um particularly if you're
 
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
shipping it putting in a container and
 
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
sending it over to China or you know
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
Europe having to to segregate it it it
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
would be it would be significant I I
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
can't give you a dollar amount but when
 
00:24:44.909 --> 00:24:44.919 align:start position:0%
I talk to them they're in the business
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
of making you know making round logs
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
into square Lumber they said to create
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
yet a whole other
 
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
class of lumber and having to inventory
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
that and manage that inventory would be
 
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.870 align:start position:0%
that and manage that inventory would be
significant

00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you uh I
 
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
have one more card Curtis Barry uh the
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
Association good morning thank you Mr
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee uh I
 
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
am Curtis Barry here on behalf of the
 
00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retail Lumber Association
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
which is uh a group of about 48 local
 
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
independent building material suppliers
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
around the country that employ over
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
17,000 people most of the points I had
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
written down for the testimony have
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
already been covered including
 
00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:35.799 align:start position:0%
representative ammon's comment earlier
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
about the width of the blade that's one
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
of the comments that the members made
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
that that blade width can vary from M to
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
Mill and therefore we'll adjust the size
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
of the of the board um I'd like to make
 
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
one comment expanding on representative
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
Terry's and representative K's um
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
questions the drying process isn't
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
something that happens all at once it
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
happens over time
 
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
time so you can get a piece of lumber or
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
a supply of lumber into the yard and if
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
it sits for a while it's going to dry
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
often the members of this Association
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
are going to have to send employees out
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
to measure each stick of lumber and then
 
00:26:16.389 --> 00:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
change the labeling that I think from
 
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
our perspective is where the additional
 
00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
cost will come in um and it would be
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
significant because labor is expensive
 
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
um the one point that hasn't been
 
00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
covered I don't think is uh when
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
engineers and other folks draw up the
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
designs for a
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
building however they do their math
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
their specifications their formulas
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
whatever take into
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
account the capacity of a piece of
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
lumber 2x4 2x8 4 by8 what have
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
you it has a certain performance measure
 
00:26:49.389 --> 00:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
and and limits and they take this into
 
00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
account regardless of whether it's
 
00:26:54.909 --> 00:26:54.919 align:start position:0%
actually 2x4 or 4 by8 it has a
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
performance standard that's really
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
what's important here the the lumber
 
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
will perform as the design specify so
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary well that's an interesting
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
point so you're saying that that um the
 
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
software program in which they use to um
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
do calculate the sizes to fit the plans
 
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
the software already has this
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
calculation and knows the wood is not
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
what not a 2x4 so uh that there would be
 
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
a nightmare at the designer's level to
 
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
try to hit handle sort out this problem
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
or there'll just be that specification
 
00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:35.799 align:start position:0%
to say is we want the other side we want
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
we want special order 2x4s that are are
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
the old style or just or worst of all is
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
we don't buy it in New Hampshire we'll
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
go by it somewhere else perhaps yeah I
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
can't speak to what the ramifications on
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
the engineering end or on the software
 
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
end are uh I'm just suggesting that a
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
2x4 has to meet certain specifications
 
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
and if it's off a little bit it will
 
00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:58.120 align:start position:0%
meet those specifications it will be
 
00:28:02.509 --> 00:28:02.519 align:start position:0%
problematic if it doesn't yes okay any
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none thank you
 
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:05.909 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none thank you
very

00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
much okay
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
um uh all bills go to subcommittee so
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
you have a chance to rebut their their
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
points in the
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay all right being 10:30
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
we're ready for the next bill uh
 
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
1395 relative to home heating oil and
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
get yes awesome thank you it's clerk's
 
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
office I need to take it to the clerk
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's where it came from okay and got
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
morning good morning Mr representative

to be here to introduce to you house

spill 1395 and thank you commer
 
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
committee um about a year and a half ago
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
a constit oh and for the record my name
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
is Rosemary rung I represent Hillsboro
 
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
12 which is the town of marac about a
 
00:29:40.269 --> 00:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
year and a half ago a constituent
 
00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:42.519 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention problems he was
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
having with his propane company I was
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
unsure whether this was an isolated
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
incident or if it was widespread but I
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
started asking around town and asking on
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
social media if others had issues with
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
their propane company and word got
 
00:29:59.509 --> 00:29:59.519 align:start position:0%
around and soon I was getting calls from
 
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
other towns Hollis Milford
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
Manchester and um they were also
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
experiencing incredible frustration with
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
their propane suppliers and the problems
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
were widespread it ranged from renting
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh charging rent on tanks that consumers
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
owned not responding to to requests to
 
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
remove a rented tank forcing online
 
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
agreements in order for a customer to
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
make a payment and not reimbursing a
 
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
pre- buby fee when the contract is
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
cancelled and there are many many more
 
00:30:36.909 --> 00:30:36.919 align:start position:0%
um so last summer I contacted the senior
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General uh Brandon
 
00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:41.799 align:start position:0%
Gard from the consumer protection and
 
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
antitrust Bureau who confirmed that his
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
office does receive many complaints
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
about propane companies to get a
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
quantitative assessment of the extent of
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
problems Granite Staters are having I
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
requested copies of the complaints from
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
the past 3 years years and this is them
 
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's over 500 pages um I've I've
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
left this in um Miss Morris's office and
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
I I'll return it after the hearing so
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
feel free to go through them but it
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
outlines incredible frustration our
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
constituents are having with propane
 
00:31:17.629 --> 00:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
dealers and I'm sure that not everybody
 
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
who has a problem knows enough to call
 
00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:21.799 align:start position:0%
the Consumer Protection Bureau or wage a
 
00:31:23.789 --> 00:31:23.799 align:start position:0%
complaint I'm sure for every one of
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
these there's probably 10 others so
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
based on these complaints you have HB
 
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
1395 in front of you and it seeks to
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
bring accountability by making the
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
following six changes to
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
statute one a contract must include any
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
pre- buby fees and ancillary charges
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
customers deserve to know what fees are
 
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.310 align:start position:0%
customers deserve to know what fees are
being

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
charged specific written or electronic
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
contact information for customers
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
wishing to discontinue service needs to
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
to be included um many of the
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
frustration is that people might call A
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
1 1800 number and it rings and Rings or
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
they're on hold forever and they just
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't have time to sit there and wait on
 
00:32:11.789 --> 00:32:11.799 align:start position:0%
hold or go through this tree and then
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately get disconnected it should be
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
as easy to change suppliers as it is to
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
sign up companies make it very easy to
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
sign up for things but extremely
 
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
difficult to uh cancel that
 
00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
Arrangement uh and also there's a
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
specific incident of a a a c a CL a
 
00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:34.039 align:start position:0%
constituent of mine in maram who um got
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
a pre- buby agreement and but he ended
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
up being charged for the pre- buby and
 
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
it ended up the total cost was the same
 
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
as it would be if he didn't pre- buby
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
and so he cancelled but they wouldn't
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
give him the pre- buby fa feeback so I I
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
think those kind of arrangements need to
 
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.909 align:start position:0%
think those kind of arrangements need to
be

00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:32:58.629 --> 00:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
outlined and if the um the the um
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
the contact information um I would like
 
00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:03.799 align:start position:0%
includeed on contracts for the New
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consumer protection and
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
antitrust Bureau I didn't even realize
 
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
being state representative and I'm in my
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
third term um the extent of the work
 
00:33:16.269 --> 00:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
that this Bureau handles and the support
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
that it gives to Granite sters and I
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
think it behooves us to make sure that
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
we can promote that service to our
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
constituents as much as possible so
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
including that number on contract so if
 
00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
people have a problem they can call blah
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
blah blah and the the um the fourth item
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
was pro-rated reimbursement for any
 
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
pre-bi fees I I already mentioned that
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
and also number five if the customer
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
notifies the dealer of any contract
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
discontinuance the dealer shall have 60
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
days from the date of customer
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
notification to remove their tank or
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
make every reasonable attempt to
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
transfer ownership to the consumer or to
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
another dealer
 
00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:00.519 align:start position:0%
this is um a big problem and you'll see
 
00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:03.559 align:start position:0%
it often in these consumer complaints is
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
a consumer may have entered a contract
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
with a propane company gets a great deal
 
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
goes on and realizes now the price is so
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
high or the ancillary charges have added
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
up they want to now go to another
 
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:18.919 align:start position:0%
company and they find that they either
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
have a real difficulty getting in touch
 
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
with their original supplier once they
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
do the supplier may take months and
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
months to come in get that tank and
 
00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:29.720 align:start position:0%
other companies won't fill somebody
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
else's tank so those rental charges and
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
those ancillary charges still pile up um
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
for the consumer and as I said before we
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
should make it as easy as possible for a
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
consumer to exercise their choice in
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
going to a new supplier as it is for
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
companies to sign people up and finally
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
and I know this is going to sound like
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
common sense but no dealer May charge a
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
rental fee for a propane tank that they
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
don't own
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
or that is owned by another company that
 
00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:02.310 align:start position:0%
or that is owned by another company that
does

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
happen so I've also included um well
 
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
just in my final remarks I just want to
 
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
say that these changes um to the
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
existing statute don't solve all the
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
problems but they are a start they will
 
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
put into law some minimum expectations
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
for companies delivering propane to
 
00:35:22.589 --> 00:35:22.599 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters and I also want to be
 
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
clear about something to our
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
constituents this bill is not really
 
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
about propane it's not really about
 
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
Commerce it's about making sure their
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
family is warm in the winter we all know
 
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
what it was like last week Imagine your
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
propane tank is empty and your propane
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
dealer has reneged on a delivery or
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
you're getting you've been trying to
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
change customers to somebody that's more
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
affordable and you
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
can't our constituents want to have a
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
reliable estimate of how much it's
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to need to pay to provide
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
that warm home to their family amilies
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
and knowing that the state of New
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has their backs by placing
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
minimum expectations on companies doing
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
business with granite Staters um I've
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
also included in um my written testimony
 
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
that I handed out some of the things
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
I've heard from people this does not
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
this is not all that I've heard but the
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
first three comments came from members
 
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
of the Science and Tech Committee of the
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
house the chairman Vose made the first
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
comment a year ago um so I I I ask that
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
you consider this and I would be very
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
happy to um try to answer any of your
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
you okay representative burrow yes
 
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question um can you
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
tell me if if a a similar bill has come
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
before the house um in the last few
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
years and if so what's different yeah
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
last year I actually had a bill I forget
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
the number of it representer Bros but it
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
was in response to some of the earlier
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
complaints I heard um I really wasn't if
 
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
it was widespread just antidotal so I
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
had a bill that was to establish a study
 
00:37:05.069 --> 00:37:05.079 align:start position:0%
committee just to look at the extent of
 
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
this does it cross a lot of companies
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
and it passed a Science and Tech
 
00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
committee and it passed the house but I
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
was so outnumbered by lobbyist and when
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
it went to the Senate that it didn't
 
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
make it through the senate committee um
 
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
but it that process and the attention
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
that bill brought made it clear that we
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
have to make some changes and that's why
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
I came I came this year with this spill
 
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
representa Terry thank you uh and thank
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
you for providing the uh the voluminous
 
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
uh evidence U that you have to uh the
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
committee uh but a confession I have not
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
yet reviewed all of that evidence and I
 
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
don't know whether it's categorized or
 
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
not hence my question and I would
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh your your best response um
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
with respect as you know bills are not
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily All or Nothing in terms of
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
how they come out of the committee Bill
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
may be amended uh I'd like to focus on
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
the provision with respect to the
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
parties that you're identifying who are
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
being charged rent for a tank that they
 
00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.750 align:start position:0%
being charged rent for a tank that they
already

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
own um two two uh parts to this question
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
could you would you describe the
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
magnitude of this issue and number two
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
um why is it that that companies are
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
insisting on on being paid rent for
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
tanks that they don't own is this a
 
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
matter of confusion or or what is it
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
what and what what what is the
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
difficulty that the cons consumer and
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
the owner is experiencing in terms of
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
trying to resolve the issue is this
 
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
really a big problem so I'd appreciate
 
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
your response to those questions thanks
 
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I hope I I heard
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
them all thank you for the question I'll
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
try um I would say and just as it's just
 
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
from my own experience hearing from
 
00:38:56.109 --> 00:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
constituents and I tried to create a
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
database base for this but it it's just
 
00:39:00.309 --> 00:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
too much in fact I'll be bringing a bill
 
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
next year to um have the consumer Bureau
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
have an online database that so it's
 
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
very easy for them to sort through
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
complaints but um and it varies from
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
companies we have some excellent propane
 
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
supply companies in um in our state they
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
do a great job for their customers we
 
00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
have one who is the major supplier who's
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
probably I would guess from what I've
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
heard 90% of the problem and um you know
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
we have laws
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
against murderers we have law but you
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
know not everybody's a murderer so but
 
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
we still have laws and so we could have
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
a really bad offender um but they're
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
getting away with it and many times
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
their justification for charging rent on
 
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
tanks they don't own is that a tank may
 
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
be underground and a customer may want
 
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
to go with them maybe there's very
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
limited suppliers in their area and they
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
have have a policy of not filling tanks
 
00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
that they don't own so even though they
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
don't own it if the customer wants it
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
filled they charge rent and you will see
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
some some of the um quotes I have from
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
people that they may have been charged
 
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
rent for over 20 years the initial and I
 
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:14.839 align:start position:0%
believe I have his letter
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
included um there was the last letter
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
um this this uh miramac resident had
 
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
built a house had it uh or yeah he had
 
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
it built I mean some people have bought
 
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
a house that has a underground propane
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
tank they've owned it it's been part of
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
the sales and purchase agreement but and
 
00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
and the company May Supply propane for I
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
think this is like 10 or 20 years and
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
then all of a sudden start charging
 
00:40:42.119 --> 00:40:43.990 align:start position:0%
then all of a sudden start charging
rent

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
rent
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
and you know it it's it's more
 
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
widespread than you think I think
 
00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
there's other people here that can
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
probably comment more about
 
00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
that okay representative Emon thank you
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank thank you for presenting
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
this testimony um I I'm kind of zeroing
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
in on the pre- buby aspect um so the
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
existing law says that the contract uh
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
shall require dealers to reimburse
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
customers at the contract price for any
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
undelivered pre-purchased fuel so that's
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
existing law and then you're adding and
 
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
any pro-rated pre-bi fees and then later
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
in that same paragraph it says unless
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
they agree to different terms so uh a
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
customer can sign a contract that has
 
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
completely different terms than what
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
what is existing law or what you're
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
adding but could you explain the preby
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
uh fees what what how's that different
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
from the the pre purchased fuel oh okay
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much representative
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
for the question what and that came from
 
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
a constit another a different
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
constituent of mine but he wanted to
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the pre-bi price for
 
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
propane but they charged him to take
 
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of that so they charged him a
 
00:41:58.589 --> 00:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
pre buy fee to get the propane at a
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
pre-bi price and he realized when he
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
added up this he just saw his bill pre-
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
buby fee and it was because it was a
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
charge that they were waging on on his
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
account because he was taking advantage
 
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
of the pre-bi program and when he
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
cancelled he wanted to get a portion of
 
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
that pre- buby back and they denied him
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
so further question me inquire thank you
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
um so just focusing on the preby it's my
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh because um there
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
there's a time value of money right so
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
you you you take a risk as a consumer
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
that you're getting a good price and and
 
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
you're kind of splitting that risk with
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh the supplier because the price of
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
fuel could go up or it could go down and
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
if we're allowing people to kind of
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
renag on that that risk taking let's say
 
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
the price goes way down and they want to
 
00:42:55.549 --> 00:42:55.559 align:start position:0%
get it sort of like puts the risk all on
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
the supplier and uh would you see it
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
that way I mean I thank you for the
 
00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
question I agree that you know being
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
reimburse for a pre- buby of fuel
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't make much sense because it is a
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
risk but it's the pre- buby fee it's
 
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
this a cons customer has to pay to even
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
participate in the pre- buby and that's
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
a set fee so I don't see where there
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
would be um any risk it's more of just
 
00:43:28.349 --> 00:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
an assess M to participate like a
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
participation fee in this preby and it's
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
not the pre- buby fee and and I'm sure
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
people that are here can can give you a
 
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
better answer but my thoughts are that
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
the preby fee is just a fee to
 
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
participate it's not based on any uh
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
level of risk of getting that fuel at a
 
00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
lower price do you know what the pre-
 
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.109 --> 00:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
see this customer sent me their
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
agreement with a maragas two pages I
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if I can even read
 
00:44:16.549 --> 00:44:16.559 align:start position:0%
it there's a safety assurance check fee
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
leak check fee meter fee paper invoice
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
fee that's
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
$299 tank pickup fee that's 200
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
reconnect charge return check fee
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
service dispatch charge emergency
 
00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
delivery fee will call convenience fee
 
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
minimum delivery fee site survey fee
 
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
underground T tank removal late fees
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
credit card surcharge equipment rent I
 
00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
assume this but this is all all the
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
other stuff so the the question I would
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
have is that um when you're doing a pre-
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
buby you're writing the check for the
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
full amount
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
mhm up front yep so at that time you're
 
00:45:02.109 --> 00:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
writing the check they should that in
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
that invoice they're sending to you
 
00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
they're telling you what the price of
 
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
the gas is and then they should also be
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
putting in that there's a fee to do this
 
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
pre- buby right should it should be
 
00:45:15.309 --> 00:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
written into that so he did pay it up
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
front even right out of the
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
get-go you know I assume so I'm gonna
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
assume you're correct Mr chair okay but
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
my concern is when they're advertising
 
00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:29.559 align:start position:0%
and I do have some of the Flyers because
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
they send it to me and I I don't have
 
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:35.510 align:start position:0%
they send it to me and I I don't have
propane

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
um if you I'll have to go I'll pass this
 
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
around but I don't believe that they
 
00:45:47.069 --> 00:45:47.079 align:start position:0%
list the pre-bi fee on
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
here free installation for lease tanks
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
are they listing the price of the fuel
 
00:45:56.349 --> 00:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
um extra 20% off per gallon with code
 
00:45:56.359 --> 00:45:59.030 align:start position:0%
um extra 20% off per gallon with code
summer

00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
summer
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
ff20 um so there's no pricing or any
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts in this FL anyways no
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
because that's the problem with the
 
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
pre-u I mean just so you know
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
historically that uh there was a period
 
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
of time where we were losing Oil Dealers
 
00:46:17.069 --> 00:46:17.079 align:start position:0%
you know I think Fuller I think was the
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
big one but we were losing Oil Dealers
 
00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
right and left and they all blamed the
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
preby as the reason they lost their
 
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
shirt because they under they
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
underpriced the preby
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
so not withstanding that so I that's you
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
know you know my interest will
 
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
definitely be what is the contractional
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
arrangement what is the consumer really
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
being told or no before they get into
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
the deal um certainly I can imagine they
 
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
don't have an exit strategy right they
 
00:46:46.829 --> 00:46:46.839 align:start position:0%
don't say this it's just open-ended and
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's part of the problem is that
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
consumer signs this thing and and might
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
be happy for several years and then
 
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
after some point in time when someone
 
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
says well I'm getting it you know with
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
this price and he so oh my God I'm
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
paying so much more why well because I
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
signed up with this contract that never
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
had an exit strategy so I I think I
 
00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:07.079 align:start position:0%
think that's worth looking at one thing
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
and I and I'm just scanning this bill
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
but one thing I see in here uh is like I
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
think you're actually want to put pre-bi
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
out of business is um a surity bond made
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
payable to attorney general the amount
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
not less than 50% of the total amount of
 
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
funds paid to the dealer by consumers or
 
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
100% um what line do you see that on is
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
it this is I guess is this I think it's
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
existing that's already in so the only
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
thing we your bill is the Bol pH stuff
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
right okay so so they already have the
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
obligation okay yeah and and Mr I have
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
nothing against preby I you know if I
 
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
was a company and I want to assume that
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
risk of a price increase for getting my
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
my propane at wholesale I totally agree
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
with that but they're passing that risk
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
on to the consumer with that pre- buby
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
fee so um essentially the consumer is
 
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
not benefiting from and the company is
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
is hedging their beted actually with the
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
pre- buby
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
fee right but it but again if the
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
consumer writes that check and pays them
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
they they kind of own that pre-bi fee
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
don't you don't they no I I agree I
 
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
think we need to make sure that that's
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
very clear to the customer that okay
 
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to offer you this propane at
 
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
a discounted price at a pre-bi price but
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
you have to pay for that opportunity to
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
get it at this price and you know you
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
have to pay a set amount of fee for
 
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.230 align:start position:0%
have to pay a set amount of fee for
it

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
spear thank you just so I understand
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
this in reading this we're not forcing
 
00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
anybody to do anything different than
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
what they were doing but just to let the
 
00:48:59.230 --> 00:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
customer know what it is they're doing
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
am I reading that right that we're just
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
we're not changing how anything operates
 
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
like getting rid of preby fees or
 
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
anything like that we're just it looks
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
like we're just telling them you've got
 
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
to let the customer know what's going on
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
am am I right about that well there
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
would be some difference with like the
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
pre-bi fee customers would I mean
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
companies would have to refund a a
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
certain amount a pro-rated amount if
 
00:49:31.789 --> 00:49:31.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
cancelled so yeah okay so the obviously
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
I wasn't paying attention that this is
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
this is stuff we have had a lot of this
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
stuff is already here in this bill so um
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
but that's for for discussion purposes
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
um that in terms of looking at just
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
these little narrow sections of the law
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
that you want to add here the only
 
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
question I would have is if there
 
00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
contract that that if that the exit
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
strategy is in the contract or that that
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
you know if something is written you
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
know this thing shall have 60 days from
 
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
the date of
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
notification I just want to make sure
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
that if they've already have that in the
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
contract about how quickly they were
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
supposed to remove something we don't
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
that the statute should not you know
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
change what was in the contract whatever
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
whatever someone's contract is is their
 
00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
contract and that I'm going back to
 
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:29.079 align:start position:0%
someone who wrote a contract 20 years
 
00:50:32.349 --> 00:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
ago and and how do they get out of it
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
then then we you know you need to write
 
00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
something because I'm assuming in that
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
contract there was no exit strategy
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
there was no expiration to it whereas if
 
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
I would hope that nowadays more
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
contracts would be but we'll find out
 
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
okay repr post thank you very much Mr
 
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
Taran thank you for this bill um I did
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
have a a pre-bi several years and that's
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
a contract that you enter into and it
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
there is it's seasonal it's a seasonal
 
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
one so and if it's colder you use more
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
early you might not have as much I I I
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
ran into that I found that was a problem
 
00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
and I never did a pre- buby again but I
 
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
would say there are some years where
 
00:51:21.549 --> 00:51:21.559 align:start position:0%
it's great and some years where it's not
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's a contract and it
 
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
ends so um I I can't see really the need
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
for um if you're going to sign a
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
contract that contract stays in
 
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
place and he should have known what he
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
paid for it right they give you all the
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
information so I wonder if um he didn't
 
00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
look at his document about his pre- bite
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
price so I I would be interested to know
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
if that was the issue to because they
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
give you the
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
prices no I I totally agree with you I
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
have nothing against pre-bi programs I
 
00:52:05.309 --> 00:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
think my husband and I have probably
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
participated some in the past my issue
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
is I think companies need to be more
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
upfront if they're going to charge you
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
to participate in that um do you have to
 
00:52:20.109 --> 00:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
pay an additional fee to be in that
 
00:52:20.119 --> 00:52:21.349 align:start position:0%
pay an additional fee to be in that
pre-bi

00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
pre-bi
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
program we did it was just an upfront
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
fee and it wasn't very big it was just
 
00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
um part of the contract and they did
 
00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
they did write it out it was Eastern
 
00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
Propane so we had no problem we still
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
use them but we use them in a different
 
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
capacity now okay thank you but thank
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
you I I would be be interested to know
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
if he if he knew the number up
 
00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
front he called me then he sent me this
 
00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
contract which I really can barely read
 
00:52:56.430 --> 00:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
um but he was very upset because the fee
 
00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
when he learned of the fee just to
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
participate in the program it wiped out
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
any savings the price he would have paid
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
for propane that day was equal to the
 
00:53:08.789 --> 00:53:08.799 align:start position:0%
pre- buby price plus this fee that was
 
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
being added on so he really wasn't
 
00:53:14.789 --> 00:53:14.799 align:start position:0%
enjoying a pre-bi price because this
 
00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:17.799 align:start position:0%
added fee was negating the savings he
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
would have had from it representative
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
Sullivan just on I mean actually some of
 
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
the things are covering here make up
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
pretty good but I'm I'm also concerned
 
00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
with the pre- buby uh discussion so like
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
even in the example you were just
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
talking about where the guy had this pre
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
pre-bi fee and when you looked at the
 
00:53:38.109 --> 00:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
fee it looked like the the the
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
difference adding that to the cheaper
 
00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
price for the pre-bi fee or the pre-
 
00:53:44.829 --> 00:53:44.839 align:start position:0%
buby price was deating the the savings
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
that he would have got if he just bought
 
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
in the spot Market but that's in that
 
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
situation like if if the spot Market had
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
let's just make a crazy example it
 
00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
doubled in price surely the fee plus the
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
price he agreed on would have been still
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
cheaper and he probably would have been
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
happy with the deal it sounds to me like
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
he just might not have been happy with
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
it and that that's how I'm interpreting
 
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
what you're saying like if the mar and I
 
00:54:09.069 --> 00:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
think that's sort of what representative
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
post was saying that is if if the price
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
Market moves in an unfavorable way then
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
the pre- buy is not a good deal but if
 
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
it moves in a very favorable way you
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
know prices double over the winter for
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
some strange reason you you've locked in
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
a great price it makes sense to me that
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
there would be a Fe to participating in
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
that program because now that's some of
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
the that's the benefit you're paying to
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
participate in that so I'm C I mean I'm
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
fine with all the disclosures and the
 
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
extent that there is a lack of
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
disclosure of what these fees be may be
 
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like we're not entirely
 
00:54:40.589 --> 00:54:40.599 align:start position:0%
clear at this moment whether or not that
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
was the problem or if he just was
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
unhappy with the price that he was
 
00:54:45.549 --> 00:54:45.559 align:start position:0%
getting it wasn't as cheap as he thought
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
it was going to be with the fee um those
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
are two different two different things
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm not I'm not entirely sure from
 
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
this discussion what we're addressing
 
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
and I read I've read through the bill
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's also not clear to me it's it sounds
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
to me that this is being motivated by
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
somebody who's unhappy with the price
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
plus the fee um or was he unhappy that
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
it was somehow not
 
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
disclosed in the point when he signed
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
the contract if that's the case and that
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
is a problem I agree but I want I'm
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
trying to get to what problem is okay no
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding and thank you for the
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
question my understanding from my
 
00:55:22.029 --> 00:55:22.039 align:start position:0%
conversation with him is that he was
 
00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
unaware that he was going to have
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
in in his mind a very large fee to pay
 
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
because when he entered into the
 
00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:35.559 align:start position:0%
agreement he realized that the pre- buby
 
00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
price and the fee that he was going to
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
have to pay to participate was equal to
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
what he would be getting anyway if he
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
was just buying without the prepay and
 
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
when he um canceled the contract he was
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
upset that they didn't um refund him a
 
00:55:59.069 --> 00:55:59.079 align:start position:0%
um part of the fee you know the
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
pro-rated part of the fee that he lost
 
00:56:03.309 --> 00:56:03.319 align:start position:0%
all of that fee for the term of the
 
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:05.559 align:start position:0%
preby contract see the problem you keep
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
saying he didn't know it was going
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
forward okay part of the pre-bi is you
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
have no idea what the price of propane
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
is going to be going forward okay so he
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely knew how much he paid for a
 
00:56:22.349 --> 00:56:22.359 align:start position:0%
fee because he wrote the check already
 
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
he already bought the propane with the
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
fee upfront so you keep saying is he
 
00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:30.349 align:start position:0%
fee upfront so you keep saying is he
didn't

00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
know that it was going to be that much
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
but that's part of the gamble that you
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
make that you don't know what at the end
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
of the day what you know what the price
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
of PR pain is going to be and so
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
therefore you have to when you pay that
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
fee up front to make that deal right
 
00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:49.160 align:start position:0%
that he wrote that check up front with
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
that fee he was making a bet that that
 
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
check was going to be less if
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
then what it would been if he had not
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
signed the prei may I have a followup Mr
 
00:57:05.029 --> 00:57:05.039 align:start position:0%
chair follow-up ch um
 
00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
so if what you're telling me is or and
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
you're not saying this but let's say
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
that this gentleman has the contract he
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
could show it to you or us this
 
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
committee whatever that this fee was
 
00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
somehow not disclosed that's absolutely
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
a problem and i' would be interested to
 
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
know that but my guess is my hunch is
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
that's probably not the case um and he
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
just sounds like he might be unhappy
 
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
that the market didn't move to help help
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
him or make it seem like it was a a good
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
bet that he made he made a bet that
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't worked out so um I'm I would be
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
interested to learn though that if
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
somehow this was not disclosed then that
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
is a problem and we should address it
 
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
but I it from this discussion it doesn't
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
seem like we know that so that's just
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
sort of my take yeah he he didn't when
 
00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
when he called me he had just signed up
 
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:53.240 align:start position:0%
for it and when he did the calculation
 
00:57:55.069 --> 00:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
it wasn't like he even knew that the
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
price was going to change whether it
 
00:57:58.829 --> 00:57:58.839 align:start position:0%
went up or down he was just like oh my
 
00:58:03.069 --> 00:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
gosh this pre- buy fee is so high um and
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
this is what I'm paying like I said I'm
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
totally fine with preby but I I really
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
wonder in that spec and that's one of a
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
million complaints is that he did not
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
have a good understanding of these
 
00:58:19.789 --> 00:58:19.799 align:start position:0%
ancillary costs that he was going to
 
00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
have to pay Beyond participating in the
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
program okay well that's going to be
 
00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
hard to leg SL but okay all right
 
00:58:31.029 --> 00:58:31.039 align:start position:0%
pelli thank you um Mr chairman and thank
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
you for the concern but I don't I don't
 
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
want to legislate based on one anecdote
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
but you do have several inches there of
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
complaints so if I were to look through
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
all of those complaints you mentioned
 
00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
it's 90% of them are from one
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
company is that true I'm estimating um
 
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
yes and what did and I would be able to
 
00:58:57.309 --> 00:58:57.319 align:start position:0%
find find out what that I don't want you
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
when you when you open it up you'll see
 
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
it okay so I will be able to determine
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
what that company was from he's actually
 
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned the name already so absolutely
 
00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
ass I'm assuming it begins with an A and
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
it ends with a s know and I would like
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
to know what is it that the um consumer
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
protection and he's about to testify so
 
00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
as soon as we're all done with our
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
questions we'll hear from the consumer
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
protection they did to remediate this
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
yes okay and um it just seems like just
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
to make a fine point these are more
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
disclosures as opposed to the uh in
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
addition to the rental fee so what what
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
the bill really drives is more
 
00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:41.960 align:start position:0%
disclosure right at the time of signing
 
00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:44.559 align:start position:0%
up and making sure that it's very clear
 
00:59:46.589 --> 00:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
but what I'm not sure I think on the
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
back page it does say it bans the fee
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
okay but I want to make sure like as you
 
00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
said that we're not um in in conf
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
conflict with whatever other laws exists
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
or what Contra the contract may say I
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we
 
01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
understand right I
 
01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:09.400 align:start position:0%
mean thank you for the question uh yeah
 
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
and most of it's one company I mean for
 
01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
Mo I would say for most small to medium
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
propane companies that operate in New
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this isn't going to change
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
anything for them they're already
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
operating very responsibly but there's
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
zero guard rails on this big company who
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
continually and and this is just from
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
three years they've been in operation in
 
01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
the state longer there's just no guard
 
01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
rails on them and when they take
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of consumers they're taking
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
advantage of someone's ability to
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
provide a warm home for their family
 
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's the the frustration is just
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
incredible um and I I would ask all of
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
you go back to your districts and ask
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
around ask people what their experience
 
01:00:56.109 --> 01:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
has been with their propane
 
01:00:59.069 --> 01:00:59.079 align:start position:0%
company yeah we have a HomeTown one so
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
we all love ours okay representative
 
01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
Herbert um maybe you don't know this or
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
the my question is oftentimes I mean the
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
Commodities are very
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
volatile and uh so they they go up and
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
down more than secur other Securities
 
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
but is there an insurance policy that
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
the supplier can take um and and and and
 
01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:27.160 align:start position:0%
res and the risk goes up to some
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
investor somewhere else I'm just curious
 
01:01:33.069 --> 01:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
because I mean that is often times a a
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
technique that are that is used in order
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
to push off the risk of a of a seller of
 
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
some product and they buy some insurance
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
and it's aggregated into a you know U
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
like mortgages you know what I mean is
 
01:01:51.309 --> 01:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
there anything like that for these guys
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
um I don't thank you for the question
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
represent I don't know but I would think
 
01:01:58.589 --> 01:01:58.599 align:start position:0%
if if I owned a propane company and I
 
01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to increase business by offering
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
a pre-bi program I'm assuming risk that
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to pay more but I can
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
definitely hedge that by charging a
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
really high pre uh pre- buby
 
01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.309 align:start position:0%
really high pre uh pre- buby
participation

01:02:11.309 --> 01:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
participation
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
fee so that could almost be looked at as
 
01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:14.870 align:start position:0%
fee so that could almost be looked at as
an

01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:17.799 align:start position:0%
insurance well again a preby is
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
something that you choose to do later
 
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
after youve already have a relationship
 
01:02:27.269 --> 01:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
with a propane company right so okay I
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
think we should hear my question was is
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
there a secondary Market that insure
 
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
right now at right now the problem is
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
going back to the original issue of
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
propane is that a lot of these propane
 
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
companies will actually give you the
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
tank for
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
free on the assumption that you are just
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
going to buy them so this is like a cell
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
phone right Verizon gives you the phone
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
for free but you have to sign up for a
 
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
to your contract and don't try to get
 
01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
out of it okay thank you very much thank
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
you very
 
01:03:00.839 --> 01:03:03.390 align:start position:0%

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
book we do have our consumer protection
 
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.150 align:start position:0%
book we do have our consumer protection
protection

protection
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.279 --> 01:03:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
morning

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.829 align:start position:0%
morning
good

01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:03:28.029 --> 01:03:28.039 align:start position:0%
morning thank you Mr chairperson members
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh as some of you may
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
know my name is Brandon Gad I am a
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
senior Assistant Attorney General chief
 
01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
of the consumer protection and anti
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
trust Bureau at the New Hampshire
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice um the Department
 
01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
of Justice is not taking a formal
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
position on this bill this morning but I
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
I would like to share that we are very
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
close to supporting it um there are a
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
couple of areas where it could be
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
improved and I think that is the only
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
only thing that is keeping us from
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
supporting it at this time but if a few
 
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
minor moderations were modifications
 
01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
were made I think there's a very high
 
01:04:04.269 --> 01:04:04.279 align:start position:0%
likelihood that the Attorney General
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
would support this bill because as the
 
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
representative just testified to U some
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
of the issues that are addressed in here
 
01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
are major problems in this state and are
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
a frequent source of consumer complaints
 
01:04:17.549 --> 01:04:17.559 align:start position:0%
to the Department of
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
Justice and so I I think that you know
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
after witnessing the discussion that
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
just took place the way I could be most
 
01:04:23.839 --> 01:04:24.750 align:start position:0%
just took place the way I could be most
helpful

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
is to walk through this bill and talk
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
about the different things that it does
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
from my understanding the actual impact
 
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:31.240 align:start position:0%
that it would have because I think there
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
is a bit of misunderstanding um and then
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
also talk about what we see in the
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection Bureau in terms of
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
the extent of each of these changes and
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
the problems that they would purportedly
 
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
fix so if you start at the beginning you
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
know the the changes that are made under
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
you know paragraph 1 A and B as I
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
understand it this is simply just a
 
01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
matter of disclosure um requires
 
01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
disclosure of any fees that are going to
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
be charged regardless of their pre-bi
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
fees ancillary charges or fees for
 
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
anything else it simply requires fees to
 
01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
be disclosed in a reasonable manner in a
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
in a contract for the purchase um of
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
fuel regardless of whether it is a
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
pre-bi contract or any other contract
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
any contract has to disclose all fees so
 
01:05:16.029 --> 01:05:16.039 align:start position:0%
you know from the attorney general's
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
perspective that's a good thing
 
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
consumers are signing up for things they
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
should know what the fees are and make
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
informed decisions about whether or not
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
they want to enter into that contract
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
um what the other thing that this does
 
01:05:29.789 --> 01:05:29.799 align:start position:0%
is require that every contract contain
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
information contact information to the
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Justice
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
consumer protection hotline so this is
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
one of the areas where I think this
 
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
could be improved um I think including
 
01:05:41.789 --> 01:05:41.799 align:start position:0%
and the Attorney General believes that
 
01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
including contact information for the
 
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
consumer protection hotline is a good
 
01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
thing and that the sooner that consumers
 
01:05:51.269 --> 01:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
have issues with home heating fuel and
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
know who to call the better for the
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
reasons that we're just testifying to we
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
live in a state where you know a large
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
portion of the Year people need to be
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
able to heat their homes and if they
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
can't or if they're having issues
 
01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
resolving a problem that's preventing
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
them from heating their home they should
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
there should be a very clear who do I
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
contact in order to address this so I
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
think adding contact information for our
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
Bureau to the contract is a good thing
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
but the way this is worded it simply
 
01:06:17.309 --> 01:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
says that they have to have the contact
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
information for the Department of
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
Justice consumer protection hotline uh
 
01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
to make this truly effective and
 
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
enforcable I think that if the the
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
legislature is considering you know
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
moving this bill forward they should
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
think carefully about a exact verbatim
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
language that should be included in
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
every single contract something along
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
the line of lines of if you have any
 
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
issues receiving a fuel delivery or any
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
issues with the provisions of this
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
contract you can contact the Consumer
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau hotline at this number
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
and the reason I say that is because
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
right now all that's required is contact
 
01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
information so a phone number could be
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
buried in the bottom without any
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
explanation uh without any guidance as
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
to what they can contact us for um and I
 
01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
don't know that that would make a
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
meaningful difference but if you if you
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
want to make this enforcable and
 
01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
worthwhile I think you have to very
 
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
clearly articulate verbatim What
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
language needs to be in there and it
 
01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
should there should be some sort of
 
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
requirement that it's you know certain
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
size of font possibly boldface lettering
 
01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
something like that so it can't simply
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
be hidden at the bottom of you know
 
01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
several pages of you know microscopic
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
font that consumers can't
 
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
see so moving on to you know what else
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
this bill would do um I think if you
 
01:07:38.109 --> 01:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
look to so I I'd like to talk about
 
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
pre-bi because I think pre-bi was the
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
issue that you know most of the members
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
of this committee had concerns about and
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
was the majority of the discussion that
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
took place so you know as you pointed
 
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
out there already is you know there is
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
there is already a law in place that
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
requires you know there are certain
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
requir ments if you fail to deliver on a
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
prepaid contract for heating fuel and
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
that is a very narrow category of you
 
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
know contract where the consumer pays
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
upfront at the beginning of the season
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
for a quantity of fuel and then it's to
 
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
be delivered throughout the season at
 
01:08:14.349 --> 01:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
the price that they already paid um so
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
as I understand what this would do by
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
adding and any pre-bi fees to the
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
requirement that consumers are
 
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for any undelivered pre
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
purchased fuel I don't in I don't
 
01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
interpret this as being a situation even
 
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
though it was the focus of the one
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
complaint that was referenced um all
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
this does is if the company fails to
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
deliver the fuel that was pre-bought the
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
consumer is not only entitled to you
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
know the m a pro-rated version of what
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
they paid for the fuel but also a
 
01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
pro-rated version of the pre-bi fee that
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
they paid so I think it's consistent
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
with the law that we already have all it
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
is is doing is wrapping in any pre-bi
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
fee into what the customer is entitled
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
to if the company fails to deliver the
 
01:09:02.669 --> 01:09:02.679 align:start position:0%
fuel that the consumer pre paid for at
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the Season which I also
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
think is you know a very strong consumer
 
01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
protection policy that could potentially
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
do a lot of good if companies are
 
01:09:12.669 --> 01:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
failing to deliver the fuel that
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
customers have already prepaid for the
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
question of whether a customer knows
 
01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
about a pre-bi fee at the time they
 
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
entered in or didn't read the contract
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
carefully enough then tries to get out
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
of the contract because of the pre- buby
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
fee that's not an issue that this would
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
cover this doesn't help people get out
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
of their contracts all it does is
 
01:09:34.349 --> 01:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
creates a requirement where if a
 
01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
consumer prepays for fuel and the
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
company fails to deliver that fuel
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
there's a remedy for the customer to get
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
their money back so the key word there
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
is the undelivered that's right okay so
 
01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
good it's good language just because
 
01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
it's in the undelivered that's right
 
01:09:52.749 --> 01:09:52.759 align:start position:0%
okay great and in terms of you know the
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
prevalence of pre- buby contract issues
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
those are not as common I think when
 
01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
companies do pre you know we do receive
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
complaints somewhat consistently
 
01:10:06.189 --> 01:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
consumers often don't know whether
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
they've actually entered into a pre-
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
buby or are in more of a you know a lot
 
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
of these companies will sign them up for
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
automatic delivery where they don't pay
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
for it in advance but they automatically
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
deliver the fuel without the customers
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
needing to contact them and then they'll
 
01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
charge them for it after it's delivered
 
01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of confusion I think with
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
consumers in terms of whether that is
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
pre- buby or not um so a lot we get a
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
lot of pre- Buy complaints that aren't
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
actually pre- Buy complaints but with
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
this language and the language that
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
already exists for pre-b I think that
 
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
consumers are and will be better
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
protected if this language is added but
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think that is the key problem
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
that this bill is intended to address
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
the key problem and the overwhelming
 
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
majority of the complaints that the
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection Bureau receives
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
about propan companies in particular are
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
issues with the tank because the tank is
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
the key to being able to receive propane
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
into your home and if you have an
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
existing tank and the company refuses to
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
remove it another company is not going
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
to touch another company's tank for
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
liability reasons so having a mechanism
 
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
for consumers to cancel a contract where
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
they have a rented tank on their
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
property and have it promptly removed so
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
that they could switch companies and
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
move to a diff whether it's a better
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
price or you know better service or
 
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
whatever it is I think that's a really
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
strong protection that our statutes are
 
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
currently lacking and it is a huge
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
source of frustration for consumers in
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
this state people buy homes where
 
01:11:42.189 --> 01:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
there's an existing tank owned by a
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
company that they've never contracted
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
with and they want to sign up with a
 
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
different company and they can't get
 
01:11:48.669 --> 01:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
that tank removed quickly sometimes it
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
takes six months sometimes it takes a
 
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
year um consumers want to switch
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
companies because they're unsatisfied
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
with the price or the new fees that
 
01:11:59.470 --> 01:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
they're being charged or the customer
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
service that they're getting or not
 
01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
getting and they try to cancel their
 
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
contract and the response that they get
 
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
is we'll get it when we can get it but
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
we're busy so you know we'll get it when
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
we can get it this would require within
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
60 days that they have to remove that
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
tank I think that is a a reasonable
 
01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
measure that would make a huge
 
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
difference in addressing the issue of
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
consumers being able to effectively
 
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
choose between competing companies and
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
have a removed promptly so that they can
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
make a switch if they are choosing to do
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
so um the only this language you know is
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
another area where I do think though it
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
could be improved a little bit um it has
 
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
an alternative to the the 60 days for
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
the the removal of the tank whereby they
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
have to make reasonable efforts to
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
either transfer ownership um to the
 
01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
consumer or to another dealer and my
 
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
only issue there is with the reasonable
 
01:12:53.629 --> 01:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
attempt language Concepts like
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable attempts are very very
 
01:12:56.669 --> 01:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
difficult for the Attorney General's
 
01:12:59.070 --> 01:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
office to enforce you know what what's
 
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable based on you know how many
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
other customers they have to deal with
 
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
how many you know folks people have you
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
know working at the company at the time
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
whether there is any interest in another
 
01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
company buying it or whether the
 
01:13:14.669 --> 01:13:14.679 align:start position:0%
consumer or the company are being
 
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
unreasonable about negotiations for the
 
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
purchase price it's just unclear as to
 
01:13:20.669 --> 01:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
what a reasonable attempt would be and
 
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
that might lead to some difficulties in
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement but you know I I've spoken
 
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
to the representative about this I think
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
that you know if the legislature were to
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
decide to move forward with this you
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
know the the way to make this more
 
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
enforcable is to put the burden on the
 
01:13:39.229 --> 01:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
consumer who is looking to move on from
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
the company to tell them exactly what
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
they want you know consumer either has
 
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
to tell them I want to have the tank
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
removed or I want the tank transferred
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
to another company or I want to purchase
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
the tank and then they have a set amount
 
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
of time to accomplish that goal if you
 
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
have that list and it takes the customer
 
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
has the initial burden of saying um
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
here's what I want to do I'm switching
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
providers then the company has to do it
 
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
if they can within a set period of time
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
um that would make this more enforcable
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
and I think that would address a lot of
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
the complaints that we see with issues
 
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
about you know propane tanks and how
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
long it takes companies to remove
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
them so question so so you you want to
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
change the make every reasonable ATT to
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
just simply say from the date of
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
notification remove their
 
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
tank or transfer ownership to consumer
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
in another days within the 60-day window
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
you know I I I'm not going toine on the
 
01:14:39.629 --> 01:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
specific window that's appropriate but
 
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
if it were 60 days I think that what
 
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
would make this enforceable from the
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
attorney general's perspective is if the
 
01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
customer notifies the company hey I want
 
01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
to I want to buy this tank they have 60
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
days to facilitate that or remove the
 
01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.709 align:start position:0%
days to facilitate that or remove the
tank

01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
tank
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
if the customer wants to transfer
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
ownership to another company they say
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
hey I'm going from company a to Company
 
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
B okay and Company B has expressed an
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
interest in buying this tank so they can
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
service this tank then company a has 60
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
days to either transfer ownership or
 
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
remove the tank right so basically I'm
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
scratching out make every reasonable
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
attempt to or transfer ownership to the
 
01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
consumer or another dealer that's right
 
01:15:23.629 --> 01:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
and we can negotiate the 60 days and if
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
that might be a problem but okay so okay
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
so that's we're I don't I don't claim to
 
01:15:30.629 --> 01:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
be an expert on what an appropriate time
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
period is but whatever the time period
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
is it needs to be one that a is
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable but also one that can
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
facilitate meaningfully a consumer
 
01:15:42.669 --> 01:15:42.679 align:start position:0%
switching providers if they want to in
 
01:15:44.669 --> 01:15:44.679 align:start position:0%
the middle of a you know a winter season
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
where they can't afford to be when every
 
01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
time it ever came to a buried tank is
 
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
and for me and i' I've dealt with this a
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
couple times it's either I either either
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
I just buy the tank outright or I've
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
actually had to buy a tank to the guy
 
01:16:01.709 --> 01:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
who was leaving I had to buy their tank
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
and then they delivered it to the other
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
guy to the guy who was losing his tank
 
01:16:08.629 --> 01:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
but in either case uh when it's buried
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
it's problematic but so usually but just
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
to say is that that that transfer has to
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
happen within 60 days okay R Terry thank
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
you uh so I'm I'm curious um what is the
 
01:16:23.159 --> 01:16:24.510 align:start position:0%
you uh so I'm I'm curious um what is the
legal

01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
legal
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
basis for a
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
company charging a rental fee for a tank
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
that it does not
 
01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
own all right and because that's what we
 
01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
heard and then secondly I don't could
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
you could you address how it is what's
 
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
the legal basis for
 
01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.750 align:start position:0%
the legal basis for
tying

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
tying
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
the the the fee for being in a preby
 
01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.950 align:start position:0%
the the the fee for being in a preby
arrangement

01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
arrangement
 
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
with the pre- buby price contract such
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
that for and let me
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
illustrate it's oil and not propane but
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's the same it's just apples
 
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
different kinds of apples here um at the
 
01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
end of a pre- bubye I used less fuel
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
than I contracted for and the companies
 
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
told me we'll either give you the
 
01:17:21.149 --> 01:17:21.159 align:start position:0%
difference back or we'll credit to next
 
01:17:23.629 --> 01:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
year well I thought you know that that
 
01:17:25.709 --> 01:17:25.719 align:start position:0%
was very appropriate that was very nice
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
appreciated that however with respect to
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
the fee why should I have expected that
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
I would receive a pro rated refund on
 
01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
the fee that I had paid just to be able
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
to enter into the program with other
 
01:17:43.229 --> 01:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
people so two questions thank you you're
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
welcome uh answer your first question
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
what legal basis is there for a company
 
01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
to charge a tank rental fee for a fee
 
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
they don't own uh you would have to ask
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
the company because I can't think of one
 
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
I mean that is that is not a common
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
source of complaint I you know the
 
01:17:59.950 --> 01:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
representative represented she's
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
reviewed all of these more recently than
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
I have you know three years worth of
 
01:18:05.709 --> 01:18:05.719 align:start position:0%
complaints I don't recall that specific
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
complaint I'm not willing to say it
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist I assume it does since she
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
referenced it but I can't imagine what
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
legal basis there would be but that
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
would be a question dealt we may have we
 
01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
may have I just can't recall I mean it's
 
01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
three years worth of complaints she's
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
referencing no no I'm only resp I'm only
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
I'm only referencing one particular
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
complaint and as far as you know your
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
department has not dealt with the
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
complaint of an that he doesn't know you
 
01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't remember it off the
 
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
top of my head I look at all the
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
complaints all the complaints not just
 
01:18:39.629 --> 01:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
the propane complaints not just the
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
recent complaint he gets a lot of
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
complaints yeah I've been I've been bu
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
for four and a half years and I've
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
looked at every single complaint other
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
than when I've been on vacation so how
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
about the pre how about the pre- buby
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
isn't a pre-bi a onetime transaction fee
 
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
for doing the doing the pre- buby
 
01:18:56.629 --> 01:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
shouldn't you that not necessarily be
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
why should that beated refunded if the
 
01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
company fails to deliver the fuel no
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
well that's what it says
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
undelivered the undelivered portion or
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
the entire Su it it it says here okay to
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
that so your arguing is well yeah it was
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
undelivered because he told me they
 
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have to deliver so much propane I
 
01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
didn't need it right I didn't need all
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
that propane so yeah I was undelivered
 
01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
because they the tank couldn't take it
 
01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
he didn't use it they couldn't use it so
 
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
so if that was so the the undelivered so
 
01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
maybe it's really the undelivered is
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
because they failed to deliver rather
 
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
than the word undeliver that is how I've
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
always interpreted that statute it's a
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
protection against a consumer paying a
 
01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
large you know purchase price Upfront
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
for something that they're going to
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
expect to get over time and then the
 
01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
company fails to up hold their end so we
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
changed undelivered to unfiled to
 
01:19:54.629 --> 01:19:54.639 align:start position:0%
deliver would that because that that
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
would mean that the the preby the prated
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
preby I don't think there's a difference
 
01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
well failed to Del failed to deliver is
 
01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
that they Del definitely delivered all
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
the propane you
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
needed they got you what you needed it
 
01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
just happened that that winter was very
 
01:20:14.189 --> 01:20:14.199 align:start position:0%
mild yes and so therefore you didn't
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
need as much as you pre- buby right the
 
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
isn't then at that time the pro the pre
 
01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
the pre- buby was just a transaction fee
 
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
for doing the preby and shouldn't
 
01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
actually be pro-rated at that point
 
01:20:31.149 --> 01:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
right so the only way that I I see what
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
the argument that you're making my point
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
is that simply saying fail to deliver
 
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
and changing it from undelivered to fail
 
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
to deliver doesn't make that distinction
 
01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
if you want to make that distinction you
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
can put a definition in the section that
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
defines What fail to deliver means or
 
01:20:48.189 --> 01:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
what unel in in this sentence and and if
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
F feel in any prr pre- buby fees if the
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh UND delivered was due
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
to the fact uh uh we try to the
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
semantics to clear that that that they
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to pay the pr pro-rated
 
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
fee if uh it was because they didn't
 
01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
need the gas or some you'd have to put a
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
definition in there to specify this mean
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
undelivered or failed to deliver means
 
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
this but doesn't mean this gotcha
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative
 
01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
axon so can I understand from the your
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
testimony in your reading of this bill
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
which sounds like it's different from my
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
reading of this bill that it would not
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
be your understanding that this bill
 
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
seeks to prate back a flat transaction
 
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
fee based there's a when you sign a pre-
 
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
buby contract I'm it says I'm going to
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
buy 2,000 gallons of gas at $189 a a
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
gallon M and there's a contract fee for
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
buying this option of
 
01:21:58.270 --> 01:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
$250 and so your testimony is that you
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
do not believe this bill requires that
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
that $250 transaction be be prated back
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
if I only use 1,800 gallons do I
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly or
 
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
not you do but there's a clarification
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
that needs to be made so this my
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of this legislation the
 
01:22:21.629 --> 01:22:21.639 align:start position:0%
one that's enacted and the Amendments
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
that are seeking to be made here were
 
01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
enacted in direct response to a
 
01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
situation where a company does pre- buys
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the season and then
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
they go out of business so they can't
 
01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
deliver the fuel that the customer has
 
01:22:35.629 --> 01:22:35.639 align:start position:0%
already purchased that's right that's
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
what that's what the original statute
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
was so if that happens and you pay a
 
01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
pre-bi fee at the beginning I think it's
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
consistent with this statute that the
 
01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
customer should be entitled to that
 
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
pre-bi fee PR rated back to them because
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
the company's gone and can't deliver
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
what the person paid for that's very
 
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
different from a situation where like
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here today the non
 
01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
delivery is not based on the company
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
just doesn't do it there's a Justified
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
reason for it that's something different
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
and perhaps that's a clarification that
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be made or should be made in
 
01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:06.719 align:start position:0%
the statute so that everybody's really
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
clear as to what types of situations
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
these apply to but the Attorney General
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
consumer protection bureau's
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this statute has
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
always been this applies in situations
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
where customers prepay at the beginning
 
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
of the season for something that the
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
company then fail to deliver because
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
they can't they either don't or they
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
can't because they've gone out of
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
business or they run out of oil or they
 
01:23:32.189 --> 01:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
you other reasons that are squarely the
 
01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
fault of the company and no fault of the
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
consumer but clearly it you know it was
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
never designed to be a situation where
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know if the if they the tank
 
01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:43.719 align:start position:0%
couldn't take any more oil then you want
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
to penalize the company for that reason
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding I mean that's
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
why the the statute was enacted is my
 
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
understanding because that has happened
 
01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
a couple of times in New Hampshire um
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
and that's how I've always interpreted
 
01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
it through an enforcement lens
 
01:23:59.629 --> 01:23:59.639 align:start position:0%
representative meu and then
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative Burrows and then
 
01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:02.270 align:start position:0%
representative Burrows and then
representative

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
post thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
providing the enlightening testimony um
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
to put it in context the three years of
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
complaints is this the most common
 
01:24:16.189 --> 01:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
complaint that your agency deals with at
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
least in the in the winter or in this
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
subject matter and and secondly can you
 
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
opine a little bit on the right way to
 
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
provide remedy if a dealer doesn't
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
remove it in 60 days for instance if
 
01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:33.719 align:start position:0%
they just ghost you don't respond you're
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
in you know call center never Neverland
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
or whatever and you need to process real
 
01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
estate transactions or whatever it is
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason the consumer just
 
01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
has it
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
removed should they be then able to
 
01:24:49.470 --> 01:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
charge that potentially large expense to
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
the company for not having complied with
 
01:24:55.629 --> 01:24:55.639 align:start position:0%
the proposed statute like comment a
 
01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:57.400 align:start position:0%
little bit on how that how we should
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
remedy that in those what if situations
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
I think I understand so or or sorry one
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
last thing like what if they just say
 
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
sure you can buy it it's cost you a
 
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars or we'll remove it and
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
sure then they have to remove it for
 
01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
that well not necessarily as I mean they
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
could say sure we'll remove it in 60
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
days if you pay us to remove it or
 
01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
whatever but anyways just like your
 
01:25:31.109 --> 01:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
opinion on that first question was is
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
this the most common complaint that we
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
receive it is one of the most common I I
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
have not I don't I'd be surprised if it
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
was the most common um you know candidly
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
the most common complaints that we seem
 
01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
to receive consistently involve
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
contractors and used car sales um I
 
01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
think this very likely may be three or
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
four if I were to guess um we also see
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
receive a huge volume of complaints
 
01:25:58.270 --> 01:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
against cable and internet providers um
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
so those those four would you know those
 
01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
that would be my top four if you ask me
 
01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I I could definitely
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
order them for you here today but you
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
know your your question about I think
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
your question is yeah how would this
 
01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
work in terms of a remedy so what this
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
would do is it would make failure to
 
01:26:16.669 --> 01:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
comply with any provision of this
 
01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
statute and unfair deceptive actor
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
practice under
 
01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
358a um and so if the consumer
 
01:26:25.109 --> 01:26:25.119 align:start position:0%
contacted a company and said I'd like to
 
01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
switch providers please remove the tank
 
01:26:29.229 --> 01:26:29.239 align:start position:0%
60 days passed they didn't do it
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
consumer had to hire somebody else to
 
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
remove the tank so they expended a lot
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
of money one of the remedies we can get
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
if we bring an enforcement action under
 
01:26:38.590 --> 01:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act is
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
restitution for the consumer so that's
 
01:26:42.189 --> 01:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
how it would work it also would give uh
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's a private right of action under
 
01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act so even if
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't take that action consumer
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
would be empowered to go to court and
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
seek restitution um or damages based on
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
you know the money that they had to
 
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
expend in getting the tank
 
01:26:58.750 --> 01:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
threefold three times as much triple
 
01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
Dames triple damages so only it's
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
purpose yeah sue sue them get the state
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
to bring in enforce enforcement action
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
and you know okay I that's not triple

House Bill 1395
 
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
um some of the discussion on preby goes
 
01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
back to 20 years ago where Jim buffetti
 
01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
was here instead of Brandon and the
 
01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
common denominator was your chairman and
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
myself um when it was issues with a
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
dealer that um collected money and did
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
not deliver was no longer in business
 
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
today so um we have some experience here
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
what I do want to bring to your

01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
last year she put a study bill in um and
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
we opposed that study bill and I want to
 
01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
tell you why the same the same arguments
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
um are with us today we've talked about
 
01:28:59.950 --> 01:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
one company one dealer it's a bad apple
 
01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:01.719 align:start position:0%
it's the largest dealer in the state of
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire okay it's a mergas so we
 
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
don't have to guess that's who it is um
 
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
also testify testimony earli today
 
01:29:12.510 --> 01:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
that's 90% of the complaints at the AG's
 
01:29:15.629 --> 01:29:15.639 align:start position:0%
office okay um we were promised those
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
listed complaints that you all have
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
there but we've never received a copy so
 
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to vet them take a
 
01:29:23.310 --> 01:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
look at them to able to comment on them
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
today uh but there are 50 propane
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
dealers in the state of New Hampshire um
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
and I believe they're reputable um I
 
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
believe they work hard for their
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
customers I believe they exchange tanks
 
01:29:39.149 --> 01:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
with one another there's two dealers
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
here after me so I'm going to be brief I
 
01:29:43.149 --> 01:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
can explain how that works and I would
 
01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:45.400 align:start position:0%
just urge great caution as we oppose
 
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
this that we don't put something in
 
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
place that that makes it difficult for
 
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
dealers to work to take care of their
 
01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.510 align:start position:0%
dealers to work to take care of their
customers

01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
customers
 
01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
um I will also tell you in the in the
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
trade magazines that we have that the
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
company that's causing all this problem
 
01:30:02.109 --> 01:30:02.119 align:start position:0%
um for you're here for House Bill 1395
 
01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
today their residential business in the
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is for sale so it
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
is our hope that a reputable company
 
01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
will purchase them and take care of
 
01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
their customers the way that we believe
 
01:30:15.629 --> 01:30:15.639 align:start position:0%
the other 49 in the state
 
01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
do and um so I would not like to see 49
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
customers pay the price for a bad apple
 
01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
um if you can figure a way to get them
 
01:30:31.229 --> 01:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
go for it but um they are also not a
 
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
member of the energy marketers
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
Association so I feel free to speak so
 
01:30:39.109 --> 01:30:39.119 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
um sections in this bill and and
 
01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
exchanging tanks if for some reason this
 
01:30:45.229 --> 01:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
bill goes forward I would kindly ask you
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
to ask the deal is behind me um 60 days
 
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
is certainly not a viable option in
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
December January February feary and
 
01:30:56.189 --> 01:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
March um but they know how to do this um
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
and I would just ask you to please
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
listen to them and also the woman Leslie
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
Anderson was behind me represents the
 
01:31:05.109 --> 01:31:05.119 align:start position:0%
propane gas Association of New England
 
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
um so she can answer a question
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
specifically to that but my concern is
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
we're here today because we had one very
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
bad company um that we admitted right up
 
01:31:16.109 --> 01:31:16.119 align:start position:0%
front um and I would ask you to take
 
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
that in consideration when you when you
 
01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
make your decision thank you Mr chairman
 
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
okay perfect all right Rob uh
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
Partners okay anybody here have simple
 
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
Energy Partners their propane guess we
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
don't have anybody from the I have some
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
applications with me we'll take care of
 
01:31:39.550 --> 01:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
that before I go um especially for
 
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh wrong it's it's tragic
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm not operating in her Market
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
because we wouldn't be here today if
 
01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
that were the case I can assure you uh
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit disappointed I had a
 
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:51.400 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff prepared and that is sure
 
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
hope yeah do all that often the case uh
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
but just by listening uh I rewrote a lot
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
of what I want to share with you today
 
01:32:00.669 --> 01:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
but at a respect for everyone's time I
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
do want to give you a little bit of
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
background for the purpose of providing
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
some perspective on my level of
 
01:32:08.669 --> 01:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
expertise here um I I'm a 32ye veteran
 
01:32:11.229 --> 01:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
of the petroleum marketing industry uh
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
half of my career was spent uh in the
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
state of Maine um operating u a huge
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
book of business for Dead River Company
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
and then also with Irving Oil as well I
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
work in their refining group um this is
 
01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
the business that I love it's the
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
business I've been in my entire adult
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
life and in 2006 I started my own um Oil
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
and Propane company in West Lebanon New
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh that company is called
 
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
Simple energy and there is no secret
 
01:32:38.189 --> 01:32:38.199 align:start position:0%
behind why I named my company simple
 
01:32:41.109 --> 01:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
energy I identified a long time ago that
 
01:32:43.109 --> 01:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
this industry is anything but simple and
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
strategically if we can make these
 
01:32:47.709 --> 01:32:47.719 align:start position:0%
transactions simple for our customers we
 
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
we win um and so to that end I want to
 
01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
offer a little bit more uh perspective
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
on where my experience uh comes from uh
 
01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
I I was
 
01:33:00.669 --> 01:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
uh I was convinced to take a role in our
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
state trade Association uh back in I
 
01:33:07.109 --> 01:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
think somewhere around 2010 but in 2014
 
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh that participation Advanced me to the
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
role of chairman of the what was then
 
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
the oil heat Council of New Hampshire um
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
today that's known as the energy
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
marketers Association of New Hampshire
 
01:33:22.109 --> 01:33:22.119 align:start position:0%
on my sixth day January 6th of 2014 of a
 
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
volunteer position that I really didn't
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
want I got a phone call from Bob Scully
 
01:33:29.229 --> 01:33:29.239 align:start position:0%
at 9:00 at night at home and he said Rob
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
I just got off the phone with the
 
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
governor and I said why on Earth would
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
you be calling me and he said I need you
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
to tell me everything you know about
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
Fred Fuller and I said I I'll tell you
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
what our industry has been jumping up
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
and down and yelling and screaming at
 
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
every regulatory Authority that will
 
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
listen to us for a very long time that
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
he is destined to fail he will run out
 
01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
of luck this is something that we've
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
predicted for a very long time and he's
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
not alone there were two companies that
 
01:33:58.510 --> 01:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
that uh that came before Fred that that
 
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh by by the way uh chairman hun I don't
 
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
want to uh correct you you seem like a
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
smart guy but those companies didn't
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
fail because of the preby program those
 
01:34:08.830 --> 01:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
companies failed because the owners of
 
01:34:12.189 --> 01:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
those companies were uh dishonest people
 
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
that speculated with their customers
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
money and did not know what they were
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
doing they were Crooks and uh I I have a
 
01:34:21.149 --> 01:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
very very strong opinion about being
 
01:34:23.669 --> 01:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
comp in this industry to those that take
 
01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:25.880 align:start position:0%
those unnecessary risks so a quick
 
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
sidebar uh when this original bill was
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
passed um I don't remember when it was
 
01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:34.360 align:start position:0%
passed but um the original legislation
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
that this house bill seeks to amend was
 
01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:37.470 align:start position:0%
that this house bill seeks to amend was
what

01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
3397 I I spoke in opposition to the bill
 
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
then and the primary reason I did at the
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
time is that the point I wanted to make
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
is that those in this industry that are
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
have been dishonest that have taken
 
01:34:53.709 --> 01:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
advantage of uh New Hampshire consumers
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
don't follow the rules um your the the
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
regulations the rules and the laws won't
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
prevent bad people from operating
 
01:35:04.629 --> 01:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
dishonest business and and not following
 
01:35:07.950 --> 01:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
through uneven contractual obligations
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
as a small business owner and
 
01:35:12.030 --> 01:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
entrepreneur of a New Hampshire owned
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
company I can tell you that we have a
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
rich tradition of compliance um we know
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
that we have to follow the rules it puts
 
01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
us sometimes at a disadvantage
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
competitively when we're competing
 
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
against huge companies that don't a
 
01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
point that I will offer um to to support
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
that statement is that we we're aware
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
it's at my company simple energy we
 
01:35:36.669 --> 01:35:36.679 align:start position:0%
compete with am maragas we are aware
 
01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
that they have a problem um I I'm not
 
01:35:41.229 --> 01:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
going to misrepresent that companies
 
01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
that falter and fail fail represent a
 
01:35:45.149 --> 01:35:45.159 align:start position:0%
certain opportunity to an entrepreneur
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
that owns propane trucks and employees
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
propane technicians and drivers we we
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
like to think that we we're positioned
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
to take good advantage of that right but
 
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
I know that that company is struggling
 
01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
um the reality is there's a law in place
 
01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
that requires any company in the state
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to register with the uh
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office annually
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
that we are uh poised to offer pre-bi
 
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
contracts we sign an affidavit it's got
 
01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
my signature on it that says I I got
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
this I'm going to cover my you can trust
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
me I'll follow the law I'm going to
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
cover these
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh contracts with the using the rules in
 
01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:26.510 align:start position:0%
uh contracts with the using the rules in
this

01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:36:29.149 --> 01:36:29.159 align:start position:0%
legislation am mergas isn't listed there
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're not on they're not
 
01:36:33.629 --> 01:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
already following the law from what I
 
01:36:35.709 --> 01:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
can tell I'm I'm not in law enforcement
 
01:36:39.149 --> 01:36:39.159 align:start position:0%
but I went to the website uh long ago to
 
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
find out you know who's who's playing by
 
01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
the rules and who isn't and I can tell
 
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
you they're not alone they're not the
 
01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
only company operating in the Upper
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
Valley that's not registered to sell
 
01:36:51.870 --> 01:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
preby that sells pre- buby contracts um
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
there is a gentleman my first experience
 
01:36:55.870 --> 01:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
with this by the way uh to let me I'll
 
01:36:59.390 --> 01:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
sidebar again was in 1993 there was a a
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
gentleman that had a startup business in
 
01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
uh the Lakes region of New Hampshire
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
that was offering preby that year I
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
remember it very distinctly 499 was the
 
01:37:10.350 --> 01:37:10.360 align:start position:0%
number now who Among Us would not jump
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
on a 499 preby right now well my
 
01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
response to that is any intelligent
 
01:37:17.709 --> 01:37:17.719 align:start position:0%
human being that understands that if
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
something appears too good to be true it
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
probably is and despite my feeling that
 
01:37:26.189 --> 01:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
way there were thousands of people that
 
01:37:28.669 --> 01:37:28.679 align:start position:0%
bought that contract including a second
 
01:37:30.669 --> 01:37:30.679 align:start position:0%
cousin of mine that lives in Falmouth
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
somehow this ended up being my fault
 
01:37:34.510 --> 01:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
from his perspective but the rest of the
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
commodity Community those of us that
 
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
were were dealers I was working for Dead
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
River on the coast of main at the time
 
01:37:41.870 --> 01:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
our our pre- buby price was $999 or just
 
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
over a dollar a gallon as much as I'd
 
01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
like to go back there the reality is
 
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
someone sold a dollar commodity for
 
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
dollar commodity for 50s and told the
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
people whose money he collected that
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
they could trust him and he would
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
deliver well not long after that he was
 
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
living in his parents basement he was
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
gone that same individual right now will
 
01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:07.719 align:start position:0%
sell you a propane tank on Facebook
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
Marketplace and I know this because as a
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
small business entrepreneur that's part
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
of a wildly competitive industry I make
 
01:38:18.669 --> 01:38:18.679 align:start position:0%
it my business to know what others are
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
offering and how they're doing it
 
01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
compared to what I'm doing at the risk
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
of sounding very arrogant I am an expert
 
01:38:29.709 --> 01:38:29.719 align:start position:0%
at risk management I am an expert at
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
fulfilling even the unexpressed wishes
 
01:38:35.229 --> 01:38:35.239 align:start position:0%
of my customers if I were not I would
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
not be here you your your rules are are
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
something that we have a rich tradition
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
of following I said that already but the
 
01:38:45.589 --> 01:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
things the the let me jump around here a
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
little bit bear with me because I wanted
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
to I'll spare you my
 
01:38:51.790 --> 01:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
rambling so when representative ative uh
 
01:38:53.669 --> 01:38:53.679 align:start position:0%
rung spoke there were a couple of things
 
01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
that she said that really resonated with
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
me that I agree with one of the first
 
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
statements she made is that she asked
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
around her town and looked at social
 
01:39:04.109 --> 01:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
media there are literally if I brought
 
01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
them with me I would show you an
 
01:39:08.669 --> 01:39:08.679 align:start position:0%
impressive stack of paper thousands of
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
comments inquiries suggestions reviews
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
that we are as a small business uh I'm
 
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
bombarded with on a daily basis I have a
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
full-time employee that just monitors
 
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
Yelp reviews Google reviews Facebook
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
reviews townwide list serves and I'll
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
tell you why the average consumer does
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
not fundamentally understand the risk
 
01:39:31.229 --> 01:39:31.239 align:start position:0%
they take when they sign these contracts
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
we tell them that in giant boldface
 
01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
online flashing signs that say we will
 
01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
not take unnecessary risk with your
 
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
money but we are handcuffed to these
 
01:39:45.629 --> 01:39:45.639 align:start position:0%
contracts the second we follow the law
 
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
and buy them we can't just let you out
 
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
of them because you feel like you made a
 
01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
bad decision is sympathetic as I am I
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
just can't do that my suppliers won't
 
01:39:57.550 --> 01:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
allow that and I'm legally obligated to
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
fulfill those contracts and I personally
 
01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
guarantee the finance of those which is
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars it if if you're if
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
that doesn't scare the pee out of you
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
you're not a scarel human being and and
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll put my neck even further out I
 
01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
would invite anyone on this committee
 
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
including uh the representative to come
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
to my office and I will show you
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
effective risk management the risk that
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
the consumer ultimately takes is
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
disproportionate to the risk that I take
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
not by a little it is huge it can wipe
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
me out it can devastate me personally if
 
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
I get it wrong it's it's not a guess it
 
01:40:36.589 --> 01:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
is not something that we take lightly
 
01:40:38.669 --> 01:40:38.679 align:start position:0%
it's also not a problem if you look
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
across the landscape of our uh of our
 
01:40:43.390 --> 01:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
industry today we're not losing
 
01:40:46.750 --> 01:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
companies like we did between 07 and 09
 
01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
well let me let me put you in the time
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
machine between 07 and 09 there was was
 
01:40:54.189 --> 01:40:54.199 align:start position:0%
a perfect storm brutally cold Winters
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
very very tightening Supply wild
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
volatility in the Commodities market and
 
01:41:01.390 --> 01:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
the prediction the experts that said
 
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
this is where the future markets are
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
going to be including companies like
 
01:41:08.669 --> 01:41:08.679 align:start position:0%
Goldman Sachs they were wrong and what
 
01:41:11.790 --> 01:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
we saw is crude oil at 146 followed by
 
01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
crude oil at 35 like that and if you
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
weren't properly hedged and you were
 
01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
speculating in that market you were gone
 
01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:23.159 align:start position:0%
right well my company was four years old
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
when that happened and even my smart
 
01:41:27.589 --> 01:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
friend said are you nuts and I said no
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not nuts I'm smart enough to know
 
01:41:32.910 --> 01:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
that taking risk in a market driven
 
01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
commodity is not a place where you mess
 
01:41:38.109 --> 01:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
around okay couple more comments I want
 
01:41:39.550 --> 01:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
to make and then I'll then I'll stop
 
01:41:42.189 --> 01:41:42.199 align:start position:0%
talking I promise so the representative
 
01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
that that represent or that uh is
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
proposing this uh bill um also talked
 
01:41:50.589 --> 01:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
about things like uh accountability and
 
01:41:53.229 --> 01:41:53.239 align:start position:0%
I again I couldn't agree more but the
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
the company that we're that we're
 
01:41:56.189 --> 01:41:56.199 align:start position:0%
talking about or the companies that I
 
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
would argue are responsible for the
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
majority of the complaints are already
 
01:42:02.430 --> 01:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
not accountable and they're they're
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
breaking laws that already exist we know
 
01:42:06.589 --> 01:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
who they are if you if you talk to the
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
dealers uh and you know my good friend
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
Dave Rashard that's here as well he'll
 
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:11.719 align:start position:0%
tell you I I think he'll tell you the
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
same story that we know who's not
 
01:42:16.109 --> 01:42:16.119 align:start position:0%
following the rules adding more of a
 
01:42:17.790 --> 01:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
regulatory burden to the shoulders of
 
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
those of us who are already complying
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
does not help it gives the bad guys a a
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
continued unfair Advantage because
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
despite your best efforts and I I
 
01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
applaud I work with Jim buffetti really
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
really closely uh and the entire Hassen
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
Administration even though I didn't wano
 
01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
in 2014 when when our industry was in in
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
crisis and and my peers and the the
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
folks that work for me we covered it we
 
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
Rose to the occasion and we took care of
 
01:42:45.589 --> 01:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire residents we know what
 
01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
01:42:49.709 --> 01:42:49.719 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that comes up a lot
 
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
in in uh in this whole discussion
 
01:42:53.109 --> 01:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
particularly when we start talking about
 
01:42:55.709 --> 01:42:55.719 align:start position:0%
propane is people yes people are
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
frustrated by fees fees fees fees fees
 
01:43:00.910 --> 01:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
simple energy has a very strict pricing
 
01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
philosophy where we put all of our fees
 
01:43:04.990 --> 01:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
in your price per gallon there is no
 
01:43:06.910 --> 01:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
there's no hidden fee that's just me I
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
can't speak for the whole industry but I
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's part of my transparent pricing
 
01:43:13.149 --> 01:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
strategy it works really well for me
 
01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
it's consistent with my name we've had a
 
01:43:16.830 --> 01:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
lot of Success With It 18 years in a row
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
we've been growing but my experience is
 
01:43:21.629 --> 01:43:21.639 align:start position:0%
that companies that have a lot of fees
 
01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
often times have a really low price
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
great introductory offer we compete on
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
price all the time it's a commodity
 
01:43:29.589 --> 01:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
right so people will call me Rob how can
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
you compete with the big guys with the
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
Irvings the Dead Rivers and I'm like
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
they they can't compete with me it's a
 
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
market driven commodity I'm buying from
 
01:43:38.350 --> 01:43:38.360 align:start position:0%
the same rail head on the same open
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
market I'm taking the same risk the
 
01:43:42.270 --> 01:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
difference is I got way more skin in the
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
game so I'm way more motivated to
 
01:43:46.589 --> 01:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
succeed I got no fallback I got
 
01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
everything I own on the line here so who
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
do you want working for you do you got
 
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
to do your homework you got to know who
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
you're asking to to honor their side of
 
01:43:56.669 --> 01:43:56.679 align:start position:0%
the contract but but I also am going to
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
push back and say when you and I do when
 
01:44:02.109 --> 01:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
you write me a check when you give me
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
the money and there's consideration for
 
01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
our agreement you have to bear the
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility for know what you're
 
01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
signing up for I'm happy to go through
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
the details of those terms and
 
01:44:12.149 --> 01:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
conditions I I feel like our industry
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
does an adequate job and it's why I
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
oppose further trying to regulate
 
01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
something that won't really fix the
 
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
underlying problem I do have a couple
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
more comments and then I promise I'm I'm
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
done uh there were a few things um that
 
01:44:25.229 --> 01:44:25.239 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from the Attorney
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
General's office talked about I feel
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
very strongly that uh independent fuel
 
01:44:31.629 --> 01:44:31.639 align:start position:0%
dealers are not the PR department of the
 
01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:34.679 align:start position:0%
AG's office we already do an incredible
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
job pushing and pushing and pushing
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
people to make sure they understand the
 
01:44:41.149 --> 01:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
risk um like I said giant boldface
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
italics we make it flash on the website
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
we send them postcards we we we can't be
 
01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
expected to displace meaningful terms
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
and conditions with this is how you
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
contact the consumer protection board if
 
01:44:57.790 --> 01:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
you're not happy um about a a contract I
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
I don't feel like that's our
 
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility um when we talk about
 
01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
enforceability I'm with you 100% but I
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
know who's in my backyard I know who my
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
competitors are you they're already not
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
complying I actually there's two small
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
guys in my in my marketing area that I'm
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
certain are 100% unaware that this
 
01:45:19.149 --> 01:45:19.159 align:start position:0%
legislation even exists yet they're
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
offering budget and preby plan and I can
 
01:45:23.669 --> 01:45:23.679 align:start position:0%
predict the future I'm not no stradamus
 
01:45:25.870 --> 01:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
but I will tell you that I can I can see
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
where this is going all right fieldings
 
01:45:33.189 --> 01:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
Rumford uh Fuller FNS in Connecticut big
 
01:45:35.950 --> 01:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
one $300 million company gone boom
 
01:45:38.589 --> 01:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
overnight guess why they didn't play by
 
01:45:40.990 --> 01:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
the rules didn't know what they were
 
01:45:43.390 --> 01:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
doing all right two more quick
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
points uh propane tanks so uh 50% of my
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
portfolio is propane the average
 
01:45:52.109 --> 01:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
investment that I make at your home when
 
01:45:53.709 --> 01:45:53.719 align:start position:0%
I put a 500 gallon tank th000 gallon
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
tank in the ground to provide central
 
01:45:57.750 --> 01:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
heat cooking generator whatever it is is
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
on order of about
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
$7,000 so you're right there's a lot of
 
01:46:03.229 --> 01:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of people representative hunt that
 
01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
don't charge for that it it's
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately part of the competitive
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
nature that we operate in as a small guy
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
imagine what that does for in terms of
 
01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
you know cash flow demand just think
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
about starting a propane company if you
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
don't have a million bucks to buy tanks
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
excavators higher techs regulator piping
 
01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
you don't start cuzz the big guys will
 
01:46:26.109 --> 01:46:26.119 align:start position:0%
do it all for nothing guess why they
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
want to hold on to you that's the it's
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
the golden handcuffs that we want to put
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
on those customers so this is this is a
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
little bit of you know full disclosure
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
open kimono we do make it hard our
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
industry makes it hard for you to leave
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
us oftentimes for the wrong reason my
 
01:46:46.109 --> 01:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
attitude is well if I can't keep you
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
I'll help you go I put all my effort
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
into making sure you're going to stay
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
but that's me that's my competitive
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
Advantage the industry in general does
 
01:46:57.390 --> 01:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
not make this very easy for the consumer
 
01:46:59.709 --> 01:46:59.719 align:start position:0%
and I get that but please consider for a
 
01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
moment that those 60-day transactions
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
you're looking for have thousands of
 
01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
dollars of value assigned to them and
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
you're asking two companies in the heat
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
of a season to not only negotiate what
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
the asset buyout is going to be but to
 
01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
TTI but potentially disrupt and already
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
very very busy schedule to go SCT tanks
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
that might occur before the new tanks
 
01:47:26.830 --> 01:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
are set which is a complaint I don't
 
01:47:29.470 --> 01:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
know that you've had yet but a portion
 
01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
of my portfolio is in the state of
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
Vermont there is a similar law in the
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
state of Vermont and that law called
 
01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
cf111 it's a consumer protection
 
01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
legislation it's good legislation it it
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
does help but one of the unintended
 
01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
consequences is because there's this
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
tight deadline of customer notifies you
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
you go get the tanks you weigh the tanks
 
01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
measure the tanks give them the credit
 
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
back if my company does that very
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
efficiently and I do and my competitor
 
01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
who has a ton of fees but a really good
 
01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
price doesn't I go pick up my tanks
 
01:48:01.709 --> 01:48:01.719 align:start position:0%
within 30 days and they haven't set
 
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
their tanks
 
01:48:05.310 --> 01:48:05.320 align:start position:0%
yet find me a consumer that's going to
 
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
be happy about that transaction because
 
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
they can't cook they can't heat there's
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
no hot water and who's the bad guy I am
 
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
so be careful of the unintended
 
01:48:16.030 --> 01:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
consequences of adding earmarks and
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
legislation uh or adding additional um
 
01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
compliance notes to this legislation you
 
01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to do it with you we'll great
 
01:48:27.950 --> 01:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
things happen when dealers work with the
 
01:48:29.589 --> 01:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
regulatory Community that's I'm not here
 
01:48:30.669 --> 01:48:30.679 align:start position:0%
to say I don't want to work with you
 
01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
guys I do but let's do it the right way
 
01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
thanks for your
 
01:48:37.870 --> 01:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
time okay we have questions from the
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
committee members representating MCU
 
01:48:41.950 --> 01:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thanks for being
 
01:48:43.390 --> 01:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the good ones it
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
sounds like thank you appreciate it you
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
sound like the kind of guy I'd want to
 
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
do business with uh if if I did if you
 
01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
were in our area um
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sometimes we have to
 
01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
legislate for the least common
 
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
denominator so my my question is what
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
does it cost now if a consumer calls you
 
01:49:00.189 --> 01:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
a customer calls and said I'm sorry I
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
want to change change tanks and what
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
what do you charge them to take it out
 
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
if anything service fees maybe nothing
 
01:49:09.629 --> 01:49:09.639 align:start position:0%
for the removal but some other service
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
fee how long does it take all that stuff
 
01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
yeah great question I appreciate that
 
01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to talk over you it's a that's
 
01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
just part of my anxiety I personally I
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
don't charge anything I it's uh I I have
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
been advised that I should there you
 
01:49:23.229 --> 01:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
know when when I look at the industry
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
you know there are lots of peer groups
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
that say well you know you got to get
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
something you know like I said before I
 
01:49:30.910 --> 01:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
can on average it's A5 to $7,000
 
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
investment that I have so if you're a
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
,000 a year client and I'm at a dollar
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
margin round numbers right I'm seven
 
01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
years before I'm breaking even on the
 
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
investment to put the infrastructure now
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
the good news is in year eight making
 
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
money that's the whole nature of the of
 
01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
the propane gas business not only that
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
but my assets are on your property we're
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
so we're we're sort of married at that
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
point but if I can't keep you happy and
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
you want to change if I want to push the
 
01:49:58.990 --> 01:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
issue I still look like the bad guy now
 
01:50:00.310 --> 01:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
I've lost a customer and I'm kicking you
 
01:50:01.950 --> 01:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
on the way out the door that never works
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know any company that uh would
 
01:50:06.270 --> 01:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
ever get your your business back or that
 
01:50:08.629 --> 01:50:08.639 align:start position:0%
would you would speak favorably about on
 
01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
the local list serve um but the the real
 
01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
cost at a minimum I'm mobilizing a very
 
01:50:20.109 --> 01:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
experienced very expensive CDL driver
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
generally could be a Class A or Class B
 
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
driver driving a Hazmat vehicle with
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
operating heavy equipment to remove
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
those tanks there are regulations
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
surrounding where and when I can move
 
01:50:32.669 --> 01:50:32.679 align:start position:0%
those tanks if they have product in them
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
so you know the regulatory checklist
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
starts to pile up and as it does in
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
order to uh satisfy all of those
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
requirements and the scheduling can I
 
01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
give you a number that's two 300 bucks
 
01:50:46.709 --> 01:50:46.719 align:start position:0%
an hour just to put someone in Motion in
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
a vehicle so let alone that now I have
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
to recapture the asset and if I can
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
replace the asset you know back in the
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
field great but that's another you know
 
01:50:58.709 --> 01:50:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh sort of unbillable uh transaction so
 
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's crazy expensive the the goal has to
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
be keep I'll tell you my mission keep
 
01:51:05.629 --> 01:51:05.639 align:start position:0%
you buying keep the asset on your
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
property make you
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
happy charge he doesn't charge we we
 
01:51:13.390 --> 01:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
don't some some do but we don't we do
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
not okay thank you very much for your
 
01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
testimony pleasure okay uh David Richard
 
01:51:24.270 --> 01:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
energy and I hope he said some things
 
01:51:28.830 --> 01:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
you were going to say so you can be a
 
01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:29.690 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:51:29.690 --> 01:51:33.950 align:start position:0%
little bit
[Laughter]

01:51:33.950 --> 01:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
shorter yeah I'll keep my testimony
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
simple great perfect um my name is David
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
rishard and I'm with DF rishard energy
 
01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
in do and Hampshire we were founded in
 
01:51:46.990 --> 01:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
1932 by my grandfather um we do business
 
01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
a lot like Rob we're very simple as far
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
as we try to maintain people's
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
relationships it is all about
 
01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
relationships and no hidden fees and no
 
01:51:58.350 --> 01:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
um we try to do everything upfront with
 
01:52:00.990 --> 01:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
people and we try to maintain that my
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
grandfather started the company that way
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
with a handshake and we still do things
 
01:52:07.069 --> 01:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
the same way to this day um the only
 
01:52:09.229 --> 01:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
fees that we do have regarding propane
 
01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
tanks is for we do have a usage fee for
 
01:52:14.069 --> 01:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
a generator but everything else we take
 
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
our pride to um size of Tanks
 
01:52:18.669 --> 01:52:18.679 align:start position:0%
appropriately so we have the right usage
 
01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
through there so we get our return on
 
01:52:22.109 --> 01:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
our investment and the customer is happy
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
so there's no hidden fees on the
 
01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
backside where they complain after on
 
01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:27.030 align:start position:0%
backside where they complain after on
the

01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:30.990 --> 01:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
backside um now as far as the pre- buby
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
program we're very um simple with in
 
01:52:38.430 --> 01:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
regards to that price per gallon um and
 
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
uh how many gallons you want to reserve
 
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
for the year now the only other see you
 
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
don't charge a fee up front no we don't
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
charge a fee up front but we do have a
 
01:52:49.229 --> 01:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
downside protection if you want to um um
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
combat that if the price goes down but
 
01:52:55.310 --> 01:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
everything is in writing terms and
 
01:52:56.589 --> 01:52:56.599 align:start position:0%
customer knows exactly what they're
 
01:52:56.599 --> 01:52:57.790 align:start position:0%
customer knows exactly what they're
getting

01:52:57.790 --> 01:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
into that's great um as far as picking
 
01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
out propane tanks and whatnot we have a
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
department that's really great we
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
monitor um any customers that are
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
non-usage and whatnot and we will um
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
send out technicians and whatnot to go
 
01:53:12.669 --> 01:53:12.679 align:start position:0%
on the road and investigate see what's
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
going off if the house was sold and
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
whatnot um so we do we don't want our
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
assets out there being unused for too
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
long it's too much of investment on our
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
end so we do try to retrieve those as
 
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
quick as possible but if there is a
 
01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
situation where there's going to be some
 
01:53:29.189 --> 01:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
ovap we're not going to take the tanks
 
01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
until the other company has retrieved
 
01:53:32.830 --> 01:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
this because we don't want them to have
 
01:53:35.629 --> 01:53:35.639 align:start position:0%
any freeze ups or without heat so we do
 
01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
work with a customer on a on a b uh on
 
01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
base base by base uh
 
01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
basis yeah so how often are you actually
 
01:53:47.069 --> 01:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
digging the tank or you just working out
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
with the other propane company and and
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
right right so we're talking about one
 
01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
company here and that's why we're all
 
01:53:58.750 --> 01:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
here but 95% of the time we will uh
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
contract out with another provider and
 
01:54:01.870 --> 01:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
they'll send us an invoice we'll
 
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
purchase a tank off them and there's no
 
01:54:08.189 --> 01:54:08.199 align:start position:0%
it's seamless perfect thank you thanks
 
01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
we do have a question representative
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
spear realizing that 49 folks are really
 
01:54:19.069 --> 01:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
good at this and very reliable and
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
trustworthy to their customers but
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
realizing that the
 
01:54:26.589 --> 01:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
largest person that operates in in the
 
01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
uh in the area played all kinds of games
 
01:54:32.669 --> 01:54:32.679 align:start position:0%
is the legislation that we're proposing
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
here that's being proposed here it it
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to me to be burdensome so I
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to get your take on it I'm a big
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
proponent to a free market if I think
 
01:54:45.629 --> 01:54:45.639 align:start position:0%
people should educate themselves on what
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
they're getting into and you know we
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
have a good job we do a good job of
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
policing other providers so if am
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
educating our customers as to what
 
01:54:55.629 --> 01:54:55.639 align:start position:0%
they're getting into and they can
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
compare apples to apples and whatnot and
 
01:54:59.470 --> 01:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
see if it's more advantageous to go with
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
us or versus the other customer or the
 
01:55:01.679 --> 01:55:03.629 align:start position:0%
us or versus the other customer or the
other

01:55:03.629 --> 01:55:03.639 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
provider representative Cole thank you
 
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:55:10.030 --> 01:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
question so there certain months out of
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
the year in New England that you can't
 
01:55:13.069 --> 01:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
take up these tanks because of the frost
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
right and what's the longest period of
 
01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
time that you've experienced that has it
 
01:55:19.069 --> 01:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
been like to four months say I'd say
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
yeah me Sometimes in April so the 60-day
 
01:55:24.030 --> 01:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
requirement in here really doesn't work
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
it makes it difficult with the
 
01:55:27.870 --> 01:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
underground tank yes thank
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
you okay representative
 
01:55:33.149 --> 01:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
Herbert I think I heard
 
01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
01:55:38.830 --> 01:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
um some of the companies in the past
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
have gotten into financial difficulties
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
and gone bankrupt y because they took
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
the customers cash flow and and uh
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
speculated on uh uh the price of the
 
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
Commodities they're dealing in and they
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
bought when they should have sold but
 
01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
the so what is there anything is there
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
anything that we can legislate that
 
01:56:06.069 --> 01:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
would stop uh your particular industry
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
from taking cash and putting it into
 
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
speculation I think that would really be
 
01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
a hindrance on the all of us people that
 
01:56:15.310 --> 01:56:15.320 align:start position:0%
are doing things the right way we're
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're really working hard to buy the
 
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
product at a good rate that we can pass
 
01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
on to the customer and we're locking in
 
01:56:24.109 --> 01:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
a rate on our end so uh we're trying to
 
01:56:25.470 --> 01:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
do the same thing and pass it on to the
 
01:56:28.270 --> 01:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
customer so if you read page two yeah
 
01:56:30.629 --> 01:56:30.639 align:start position:0%
that's the stuff we
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
did to address that problem so we are
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
that we already addressed that problem
 
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
several years so they're they're
 
01:56:42.189 --> 01:56:42.199 align:start position:0%
actually not they're breaking the law
 
01:56:44.669 --> 01:56:44.679 align:start position:0%
that these people if we've got a a
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on doing that and they are
 
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
doing it uh why wouldn't uh our uh uh
 
01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
attorney general uh crack down we're
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
providing we have a contract and we're
 
01:57:00.990 --> 01:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
going through with that contract that we
 
01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
are providing for the customer price per
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
gallon and we're not bearing from that
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
on our
 
01:57:08.709 --> 01:57:08.719 align:start position:0%
end well that's fine but some people
 
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
apparently are but I feel like that
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
might be punishing the rest of us that I
 
01:57:15.629 --> 01:57:15.639 align:start position:0%
feel like we can kind of police
 
01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
ourselves as an industry and people
 
01:57:19.870 --> 01:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
would come to us because we are doing
 
01:57:21.709 --> 01:57:21.719 align:start position:0%
things the right
 
01:57:21.719 --> 01:57:23.870 align:start position:0%
things the right
way

01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:25.430 align:start position:0%
way
okay

01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:57:27.550 --> 01:57:27.560 align:start position:0%
W representative wals then
 
01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:29.229 align:start position:0%
W representative wals then
representative

01:57:29.229 --> 01:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
mcor thank you Mr chairman forgive me if
 
01:57:34.350 --> 01:57:34.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps you're not the right person to
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
ask but do you know if there's anywhere
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire where
 
01:57:40.510 --> 01:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
monopoly that exists of just one
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
provider for
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
propane no we we have 50 of us that are
 
01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
providing propane in the state right now
 
01:57:54.350 --> 01:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
so there's no town There's No District
 
01:57:57.229 --> 01:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
there's no area that is a monopoly not
 
01:57:59.189 --> 01:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
as far no
 
01:58:01.709 --> 01:58:01.719 align:start position:0%
okay all right it's a very competitive
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
market right well my question is you
 
01:58:11.149 --> 01:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
know this would prevent any you know um
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
evildoers if that were the case you know
 
01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying thank
 
01:58:20.430 --> 01:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
you and representative m uh thank you Mr
 
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
chairman both you and the previous
 
01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
speaker spoke about that 60-day problem
 
01:58:29.629 --> 01:58:29.639 align:start position:0%
um is it possible and I I look at the uh
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
the writer of this legislation if we
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
excluded um heating months and so it
 
01:58:37.589 --> 01:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
would be 60 days outside of heating
 
01:58:38.910 --> 01:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
months in other words you wouldn't have
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
to let's say from November through April
 
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:45.560 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to remove a tank would
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
that work number one number two is there
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
any other thing in this leg legislation
 
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
that you think is uh garious to your
 
01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:54.149 align:start position:0%
that you think is uh garious to your
your

01:58:54.149 --> 01:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:58:55.870 --> 01:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
business I think it's a little
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
burdensome to the industry right now I
 
01:59:00.510 --> 01:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
again I'm a free market type of guy I
 
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
really believe in going with that as far
 
01:59:06.030 --> 01:59:06.040 align:start position:0%
as we don't really need a lot of it um
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
legislation and mandates to operate the
 
01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.719 align:start position:0%
right way in the
 
01:59:12.030 --> 01:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
state I understand your side but we're
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
not you know people that are doing
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
things the right way people will
 
01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
gravitate towards doing business with
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
them okay thank you very much you have

02:00:13.629 --> 02:00:13.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully this problem will take care of
 
02:00:16.189 --> 02:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
of itself uh that has been out
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
there um I also one of the things our
 
02:00:22.030 --> 02:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
association does is we we do work with
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
any c consumer complaints customers find
 
02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
our our number if they have problems and
 
02:00:28.589 --> 02:00:28.599 align:start position:0%
I will interact and go directly to the
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
heads of the companies and talk with
 
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
them and if any of you ever have a
 
02:00:36.069 --> 02:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
problem um as I've offered to um the
 
02:00:37.709 --> 02:00:37.719 align:start position:0%
representative sponsoring this bill
 
02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
please feel free to reach out to our
 
02:00:42.270 --> 02:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
association and we will work to
 
02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
facilitate and solve that problem as
 
02:00:46.589 --> 02:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible um when we've had
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
deep freezes we've had the governor call
 
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
us and ask us to deliver to people that
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
haven't paid their bill in 9 months you
 
02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
know but they had kids at home and we
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
can make things happen um when they need
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
to because we all care about the
 
02:01:00.750 --> 02:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
consumers and our customers here in New
 
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so please use us as a resource
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
if you ever have any issue um one of the
 
02:01:08.830 --> 02:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
the main things uh that we have a
 
02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
problem with about this bill is it's
 
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
taking a pre-bi and a guaranteed price
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
plan statute that was put in place after
 
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
the events that Rob discussed earlier
 
02:01:19.629 --> 02:01:19.639 align:start position:0%
where we had the problem s with Fred
 
02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
Fuller in the state and and it required
 
02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
dealers to lock in the gallon so if
 
02:01:27.790 --> 02:01:27.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to sell 100 gallons preby
 
02:01:29.550 --> 02:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
you've got to lock in 75 of those
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
gallons and you've got to file a form
 
02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:33.320 align:start position:0%
that goes to the state each year saying
 
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
how you locked them in and the way you
 
02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
lock them in is by buying future
 
02:01:39.550 --> 02:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
contracts and the buying future
 
02:01:41.709 --> 02:01:41.719 align:start position:0%
contracts has a price and some of our
 
02:01:43.950 --> 02:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
members roll that into their price some
 
02:01:46.350 --> 02:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
of them put that as a pre-bi pro you
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
know price so the idea about prorating
 
02:01:53.629 --> 02:01:53.639 align:start position:0%
this pre-bi fees that's the flat fee and
 
02:01:55.470 --> 02:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
if somebody pro-rated it they probably
 
02:01:57.149 --> 02:01:57.159 align:start position:0%
just broke it up monthly to make it
 
02:01:59.229 --> 02:01:59.239 align:start position:0%
easier on the payments that were there
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
so so that section needs to come out
 
02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
because that's a fixed price and that's
 
02:02:05.629 --> 02:02:05.639 align:start position:0%
what drives what that is and I I think
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
you guys have have come to that
 
02:02:09.069 --> 02:02:09.079 align:start position:0%
conclusion through the testimony um
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's gone on um but we've taken this
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
pre-bi and guaranteed plan and we've
 
02:02:16.990 --> 02:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
thrown a bunch of other stuff into the
 
02:02:19.629 --> 02:02:19.639 align:start position:0%
mix on the third line we we've added
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
contracts for petroleum and so now we're
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
saying all petroleum products have to
 
02:02:27.510 --> 02:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
adhere to the rules we put in place just
 
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
for pre- buying guaranteed price
 
02:02:32.589 --> 02:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
programs and that's that's a problem
 
02:02:36.430 --> 02:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
because um down in section
 
02:02:38.669 --> 02:02:38.679 align:start position:0%
two uh it says that you have to have the
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
price per gallon in every contract that
 
02:02:42.270 --> 02:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
you have well you'd want that for a
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
pre-bi a guaranteed price ban but now we
 
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
might be increasing costs if we apply
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
this to all petroleum products because
 
02:02:51.189 --> 02:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
because one of the most common types of
 
02:02:54.270 --> 02:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
pro uh of programs that our dealers do
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
is they give you a cap price they say
 
02:02:59.910 --> 02:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to charge you 350 a gallon
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
but if the price in the market goes down
 
02:03:05.870 --> 02:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
you can get the lower cost uh so I'm
 
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
just weary about expanding this to all
 
02:03:09.870 --> 02:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
contracts for petroleum because now
 
02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
we're tying in with all these
 
02:03:12.910 --> 02:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
requirements that we put together for
 
02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
pre-bi and for for um guaranteed price
 
02:03:17.790 --> 02:03:17.800 align:start position:0%
plans and I think that's going to cause
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
some problems and it might incre
 
02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
increase prices because people will say
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
I can't offer a a a cap price because I
 
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that price is going to
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
be if it goes down where are you what
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
are where are you looking at so in line
 
02:03:32.430 --> 02:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
three it ex it adds and contracts for
 
02:03:35.069 --> 02:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
petroleum and I would take that out and
 
02:03:37.149 --> 02:03:37.159 align:start position:0%
and limit this to the pre- buby and the
 
02:03:39.550 --> 02:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
guaranteed price programs that are there
 
02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
in contract I Goa in contract yeah okay
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
um the the other um area that really
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
concerned me was the underground tanks
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
um and specifically for for tank
 
02:03:55.470 --> 02:03:55.480 align:start position:0%
removals the 60-day tank
 
02:03:58.149 --> 02:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
removals um most of our members pick up
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
their tanks within two weeks or within
 
02:04:03.149 --> 02:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
30 days uh and that's because they're
 
02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
expensive and they don't want that asset
 
02:04:05.950 --> 02:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
sitting out there not doing anything for
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
their business uh it's very competitive
 
02:04:09.669 --> 02:04:09.679 align:start position:0%
business they don't want the tanks out
 
02:04:09.679 --> 02:04:11.109 align:start position:0%
business they don't want the tanks out
there

02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
so 60 days I think is a is a good time
 
02:04:16.189 --> 02:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
except that there's problems right
 
02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
there's problems in the wintertime and
 
02:04:19.149 --> 02:04:19.159 align:start position:0%
there's especially problem with
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
underground tanks so if this was to move
 
02:04:23.790 --> 02:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
forward at all we would want to have
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
this apply only to above ground tanks
 
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
underground tanks the ground's frozen
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
you need to coordinate you've got
 
02:04:33.790 --> 02:04:33.800 align:start position:0%
Landscaping issues mud season I mean
 
02:04:35.629 --> 02:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
there's all these things that surround
 
02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:37.679 align:start position:0%
underground tanks uh and normally what
 
02:04:39.390 --> 02:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
happens is those tanks are transferred
 
02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
they're either sold to the customer or
 
02:04:43.870 --> 02:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
they're sold to another uh propane
 
02:04:46.430 --> 02:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
marketers that's taking over the account
 
02:04:48.430 --> 02:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
but we would want to exclude underground
 
02:04:50.510 --> 02:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
tanks from any kind of so it says or
 
02:04:52.709 --> 02:04:52.719 align:start position:0%
make every reasonable effort that that
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
the the AG's office want to yank that
 
02:04:57.950 --> 02:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
out we should leave that in for just
 
02:05:00.549 --> 02:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
underground no I would take I would just
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
add to remove their above ground tanks I
 
02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even include underground tanks
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
in this
 
02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
requirement uh the the majority of the
 
02:05:10.990 --> 02:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
complaints that come in are about above
 
02:05:13.149 --> 02:05:13.159 align:start position:0%
ground tanks they're not about
 
02:05:14.910 --> 02:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
underground tanks so I would exclude
 
02:05:17.950 --> 02:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
those oh I see okay and I would leave in
 
02:05:20.830 --> 02:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
the reasonable attempt because there's
 
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
tanks on islands where where you may
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
have to go out and get them when the ice
 
02:05:26.950 --> 02:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
is frozen you know I mean
 
02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
there's there's tanks on camps that you
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
can't access certain times of the year
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
they so TR you know the the dealer can
 
02:05:36.549 --> 02:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
show a good attempt I think to try to
 
02:05:37.870 --> 02:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
get their tanks within that certain
 
02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
amount of time but there's a lot of
 
02:05:41.109 --> 02:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
Mother Nature that factors into that
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
more than anything else the other thing
 
02:05:45.069 --> 02:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
is it should not be from the contract
 
02:05:47.149 --> 02:05:47.159 align:start position:0%
termination date that you have to pick
 
02:05:48.750 --> 02:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
up your tank it should be a not no
 
02:05:51.390 --> 02:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
ification requests to come pick up your
 
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
tank from the customer or from the the
 
02:05:55.990 --> 02:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
company that's taking over the account
 
02:05:57.790 --> 02:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
and I say that because you may terminate
 
02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
your contract today but you've got 50%
 
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
in your tank and you want to use the
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
remaining gallons and then switch to a
 
02:06:07.229 --> 02:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
new dealer and so I don't know how long
 
02:06:08.549 --> 02:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
it's going to take you to use those
 
02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
gallons you know if you're just one
 
02:06:11.470 --> 02:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
person on your own it might take a
 
02:06:14.430 --> 02:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
couple months uh if you're a big family
 
02:06:16.109 --> 02:06:16.119 align:start position:0%
it might take two weeks but the clock
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't really start ticking until uh
 
02:06:20.910 --> 02:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
you want that tank picked up so it
 
02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
should be a notification date from from
 
02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
then um and and I think above ground 60
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
days with a reasonable attempt is is
 
02:06:32.830 --> 02:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
fine um although I would prefer as my
 
02:06:34.510 --> 02:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
members on the whole would prefer that
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
that we not expand this regulation and
 
02:06:39.669 --> 02:06:39.679 align:start position:0%
that we really not move it forward um
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
but I did want to want to add that well
 
02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
it says right now is or written notific
 
02:06:47.149 --> 02:06:47.159 align:start position:0%
of discontinuance of the contract but
 
02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
you might discontinue your contract and
 
02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
then use up the propane that's left in
 
02:06:52.350 --> 02:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
your tank
 
02:06:54.430 --> 02:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
before you're ready to have your tank
 
02:06:56.990 --> 02:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
picked up so it needs to be a notice to
 
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
remove your tank a request for the owner
 
02:07:01.870 --> 02:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
to remove their
 
02:07:05.709 --> 02:07:05.719 align:start position:0%
tank okay yeah
 
02:07:11.310 --> 02:07:11.320 align:start position:0%
okay all right um still going
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
um I mentioned we have over 50 members
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
they're very competitive um the
 
02:07:19.390 --> 02:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
complaints that we do get are usually
 
02:07:21.669 --> 02:07:21.679 align:start position:0%
about how much their price per gallon is
 
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
these are the most frequent complaints
 
02:07:26.669 --> 02:07:26.679 align:start position:0%
that um usually come in from the AG's
 
02:07:28.109 --> 02:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
office if they contact me about
 
02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
something and it's simply based on how
 
02:07:33.149 --> 02:07:33.159 align:start position:0%
much you use you know the investment
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
that's out there that we have um I've
 
02:07:36.870 --> 02:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
had a lot of complaints about people
 
02:07:39.990 --> 02:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
that have propane for generators only
 
02:07:42.350 --> 02:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
that the more and more electric get gets
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
moving and people move to heat pumps and
 
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
other things everybody's putting in
 
02:07:50.589 --> 02:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
generators for propane and you have to
 
02:07:54.109 --> 02:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
charge a tank rental or a minimum gallon
 
02:07:56.350 --> 02:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
usage per year to make up your
 
02:07:58.549 --> 02:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
investment if you have tanks at a
 
02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
generator account uh because you've got
 
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
that investment of about $3,000 sitting
 
02:08:06.390 --> 02:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
there at the customer's location so
 
02:08:08.830 --> 02:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
there's frequently a charge for a tank
 
02:08:11.629 --> 02:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
rental or a minimum usage fee if you're
 
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
not using propane for home heat for
 
02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
cooking for hot water for pool heaters
 
02:08:19.149 --> 02:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
for everything else um and we get lots
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
of complaints about that but the reason
 
02:08:24.549 --> 02:08:24.559 align:start position:0%
is because there's so much investment
 
02:08:26.189 --> 02:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
there by the company owning those above
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
ground tanks yeah but I remember the old
 
02:08:31.549 --> 02:08:31.559 align:start position:0%
days and and the complaint was that they
 
02:08:34.430 --> 02:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
paid more for the tank to be filled than
 
02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
a bigger tank so I'm confused is the
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
only thing I see is is we're Banning
 
02:08:42.750 --> 02:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
somebody else owning that tank it's
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
still your yeah that doesn't make any
 
02:08:46.830 --> 02:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
sense to me because you can't charge for
 
02:08:48.870 --> 02:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
something you don't own right so so
 
02:08:50.549 --> 02:08:50.559 align:start position:0%
therefore that that sentence really
 
02:08:53.470 --> 02:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean anything to you because you
 
02:08:55.149 --> 02:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
guys all own your own tanks we own our
 
02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
own tanks I mean I don't know if that's
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
confusion because sold the tanks to
 
02:09:01.470 --> 02:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
compan somebody thought that they that
 
02:09:03.310 --> 02:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
they were doing and that's why it's in
 
02:09:05.189 --> 02:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
the bill yeah you know because they
 
02:09:07.709 --> 02:09:07.719 align:start position:0%
someone thought that um that somebody
 
02:09:10.109 --> 02:09:10.119 align:start position:0%
else owned the tank but in terms of this
 
02:09:11.549 --> 02:09:11.559 align:start position:0%
thing about the
 
02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
fee did did where where did it say that
 
02:09:16.589 --> 02:09:16.599 align:start position:0%
you couldn't charge a rental fee for a
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
propane tank owned by another company or
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
cons but that owned by another company
 
02:09:23.629 --> 02:09:23.639 align:start position:0%
or consumer so so I don't know if that's
 
02:09:25.549 --> 02:09:25.559 align:start position:0%
confusion because if you switch
 
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
companies sometimes the dealers will
 
02:09:30.350 --> 02:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
sell tanks to the new provider rather
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
than go in and take out their tanks and
 
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
put in new tanks I don't know if that's
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
the confusion or if there has been
 
02:09:38.549 --> 02:09:38.559 align:start position:0%
confusion um with some of the
 
02:09:40.830 --> 02:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
Acquisitions as to whether the new way
 
02:09:42.750 --> 02:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
sentence is written you really doesn't
 
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
bother you because you none of your guys
 
02:09:47.629 --> 02:09:47.639 align:start position:0%
do that anyways no that's correct
 
02:09:49.229 --> 02:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
perfect yeah all right thank you
 
02:09:51.189 --> 02:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
represent I'd be glad to answer any
 
02:09:53.669 --> 02:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
questions okay represent Amon I have two
 
02:09:55.350 --> 02:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
quick ones
 
02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh first one is uh how how could a
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
consumer know who who owns the
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
tank uh it'll say on the tank itself
 
02:10:05.709 --> 02:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
inside they have to have the number of
 
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
who's supplying and it'll usually say
 
02:10:10.149 --> 02:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
owned by this person that's there switch
 
02:10:12.270 --> 02:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
that out I guess yeah I do get calls
 
02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
from new homeowners sometimes that are
 
02:10:16.030 --> 02:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
looking for documentation can't figure
 
02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
out if they own it or if they don't own
 
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
it and I'll work with propane companies
 
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
to help them find out because the
 
02:10:22.589 --> 02:10:22.599 align:start position:0%
companies will have them as listed as an
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
asset unless they've sold them and they
 
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
so you can usually go back to the
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
whoever the provider is and find out if
 
02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:30.599 align:start position:0%
you if you bought the tank or not if it
 
02:10:32.189 --> 02:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't specifically listed when you
 
02:10:34.350 --> 02:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
purchased your home okay and then
 
02:10:37.950 --> 02:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
followup question um how can a consumer
 
02:10:41.229 --> 02:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
know uh a consumer seeking to switch
 
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
providers how can they find out what
 
02:10:47.149 --> 02:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
providers service their their area all
 
02:10:48.750 --> 02:10:48.760 align:start position:0%

and yes I'm glad I was uh here for that
 
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
last discussion good
 
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
orientation on the kinds of
 
02:12:29.549 --> 02:12:29.559 align:start position:0%
consumer protection uh Provisions that
 
02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
you're uh
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
considering mine is in that same Zone
 
02:12:37.549 --> 02:12:37.559 align:start position:0%
this is a simple direct consumer
 
02:12:41.069 --> 02:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
protection measure it's narrowly
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
drawn so that it relates specifically to
 
02:12:46.750 --> 02:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
heating fuel
 
02:12:48.669 --> 02:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
delivery and
 
02:12:48.679 --> 02:12:49.549 align:start position:0%
delivery and
its

02:12:49.549 --> 02:12:49.559 align:start position:0%
its
 
02:12:53.950 --> 02:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
purpose is that whenever a customer
 
02:12:57.149 --> 02:12:57.159 align:start position:0%
prepays I'm not talking about pre uh
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
payment contracts I'm talking about at
 
02:13:03.310 --> 02:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
will customers who call the fuel
 
02:13:06.589 --> 02:13:06.599 align:start position:0%
delivery company and make an arrangement
 
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
for the delivery of a certain quantity
 
02:13:12.910 --> 02:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
of gallons on a certain date and pay at
 
02:13:14.589 --> 02:13:14.599 align:start position:0%
that time so these are
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
customers who for whatever reasons are
 
02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
not using pre-bond I are not uh on a
 
02:13:25.709 --> 02:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
automated delivery schedule and do not
 
02:13:28.830 --> 02:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
have credit terms in which case
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
typically the delivery is made and
 
02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
there's 30 days within which to
 
02:13:37.310 --> 02:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
pay so when a
 
02:13:41.189 --> 02:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
customer calls let's say on a Monday and
 
02:13:43.629 --> 02:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
says I'd like to arrange for 300 gallons
 
02:13:46.430 --> 02:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
of heating fuel to be delivered to my
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
tank on Thursday
 
02:13:50.669 --> 02:13:50.679 align:start position:0%
price is quoted on
 
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
Monday and that price is
 
02:13:57.870 --> 02:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
paid that in terms of this bill is a
 
02:13:57.880 --> 02:13:59.709 align:start position:0%
paid that in terms of this bill is a
concluded

02:13:59.709 --> 02:13:59.719 align:start position:0%
concluded
 
02:14:03.990 --> 02:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
sale and this is one of those situations
 
02:14:07.229 --> 02:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
I've become aware of I I know that it is
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh uh the common practice of one of the
 
02:14:13.109 --> 02:14:13.119 align:start position:0%
largest fuel delivery companies in the
 
02:14:15.950 --> 02:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
state I don't want to uh make any
 
02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
representations about how pervasive it
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
is I just simply know that it should not
 
02:14:23.870 --> 02:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
be allowed so why would we allow a
 
02:14:27.549 --> 02:14:27.559 align:start position:0%
custom a a fuel delivery company to
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
reprice the
 
02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
oil as following my example on the
 
02:14:35.669 --> 02:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
Thursday if they already quoted a price
 
02:14:37.629 --> 02:14:37.639 align:start position:0%
and collected full payment for that
 
02:14:40.709 --> 02:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
price on the Monday and I know that this
 
02:14:43.390 --> 02:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
inv volatile markets can be a few
 
02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
pennies up it could even be a few
 
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
pennies down but in recent years it's
 
02:14:49.870 --> 02:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
it's often been as much as even in the
 
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
space of several days a 20 to 50 Cent
 
02:14:57.790 --> 02:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
swing so somebody orders 300 gallons and
 
02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:00.599 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden finds on Thursday that
 
02:15:03.669 --> 02:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
what he paid for on Monday is now $75
 
02:15:06.189 --> 02:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
higher so I'll leave it there I think
 
02:15:08.629 --> 02:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
it's straightforward
 
02:15:12.830 --> 02:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh I'm actually pretty astounded
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
that this is not currently prohibited
 
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
well I I assume because you don't have
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
how many
 
02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
days it it shouldn't make a difference
 
02:15:26.549 --> 02:15:26.559 align:start position:0%
how many days when when the when the
 
02:15:30.589 --> 02:15:30.599 align:start position:0%
price is quoted and the payment is made
 
02:15:33.629 --> 02:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
that that under the terms constitutes a
 
02:15:35.870 --> 02:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
concluded sale a concluded sale
 
02:15:38.629 --> 02:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
meaning a sale agreed at a quoted price
 
02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
and paid for at that price prior to
 
02:15:43.069 --> 02:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
delivery whether the delivery is that
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
afternoon a week later or four months
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
later shouldn't make any difference
 
02:15:49.990 --> 02:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
because you bought it so I'll just I
 
02:15:52.669 --> 02:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
give you two thoughts that occur to me
 
02:15:55.149 --> 02:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
um just by analogy it's hard to make a a
 
02:15:58.589 --> 02:15:58.599 align:start position:0%
direct analogy but you know I go into
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
Macy's for bed sheets and they don't
 
02:16:03.149 --> 02:16:03.159 align:start position:0%
have them in stock they say well we can
 
02:16:05.069 --> 02:16:05.079 align:start position:0%
sell them to you now and we'll have them
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
delivered to your home I go into Staples
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
they don't have the printer ink they
 
02:16:11.549 --> 02:16:11.559 align:start position:0%
don't have the the pens right I'm sure
 
02:16:13.149 --> 02:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
we've all been there these are examples
 
02:16:15.629 --> 02:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
that I'm personally familiar with can
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
you imagine the outrage from the
 
02:16:21.149 --> 02:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
consumers in this world if somebody
 
02:16:23.830 --> 02:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
walked into the Staples or the Macy's on
 
02:16:26.149 --> 02:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
a Monday paid for it and then found on
 
02:16:28.109 --> 02:16:28.119 align:start position:0%
the Thursday when the delivery arrived
 
02:16:29.549 --> 02:16:29.559 align:start position:0%
that they owed
 
02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
more outrageous it's inconceivable right
 
02:16:34.750 --> 02:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
it's outrageous outrageous so please
 
02:16:38.270 --> 02:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
help me by passing this bill pretty
 
02:16:40.429 --> 02:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
straightforward okay thank you for
 
02:16:44.469 --> 02:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
giving us a straightforward one okay oh
 
02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative Amon has a question I
 
02:16:49.870 --> 02:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
I know we're we're in lunchtime here um
 
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
could you just walk me through where
 
02:16:54.629 --> 02:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
this bill idea came from and the
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
specifics of uh you know how did the
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
this occur to you or your constituent he
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
say he's an oil dealer that does
 
02:17:05.230 --> 02:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
this so let's be specific um this has
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
occurred to me I choose not to be a
 
02:17:10.509 --> 02:17:10.519 align:start position:0%
credit customer and this has occurred to
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
me for years and so I began speaking to
 
02:17:16.469 --> 02:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
other people and I've had conversations
 
02:17:18.509 --> 02:17:18.519 align:start position:0%
with 20 or 30 people to whom this has
 
02:17:20.990 --> 02:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
occurred so it's you know it's not I'm
 
02:17:23.070 --> 02:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
not just it's not just that I have a
 
02:17:25.629 --> 02:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
chip on my shoulder it's that I I have
 
02:17:29.230 --> 02:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:32.309 --> 02:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
exists and and we can we can often be
 
02:17:35.309 --> 02:17:35.319 align:start position:0%
talking about um price differentials in
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
a matter of days that are $50 to
 
02:17:41.950 --> 02:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
$100 okay representative
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
Walsh thank you Mr chairman how is this
 
02:17:48.030 --> 02:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
different from say me going to to buy
 
02:17:50.990 --> 02:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
gas one day at$ 2.99 and then the next
 
02:17:54.190 --> 02:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
day I see that it went down to 283 or
 
02:17:57.870 --> 02:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
something how is that different so on
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
the you're you're talking about you're
 
02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
talking about your your automobile the
 
02:18:05.150 --> 02:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
payment and the delivery
 
02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
coincided so the here's the point so
 
02:18:10.230 --> 02:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
you're your last bill you were
 
02:18:12.990 --> 02:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
discussing uh pre-bi contracts and one
 
02:18:15.629 --> 02:18:15.639 align:start position:0%
of the the fellows who testified talked
 
02:18:18.150 --> 02:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
about who takes the risk of price
 
02:18:21.030 --> 02:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
fluctuations that occur after the sale
 
02:18:22.349 --> 02:18:22.359 align:start position:0%
agreement which may have occurred in
 
02:18:24.270 --> 02:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
July and deliveries in January and
 
02:18:28.309 --> 02:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
February so the the point is that the
 
02:18:30.990 --> 02:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
consumer who has made the payment on the
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
Monday should not be the party that's
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
taking the price risk of fluctuations
 
02:18:38.190 --> 02:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
that occur between Monday and
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
Thursday and when you go to your gas
 
02:18:44.830 --> 02:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
station with your car you pay you decide
 
02:18:46.910 --> 02:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
whether to drive away or to take the gas
 
02:18:48.429 --> 02:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
and you get the delivery
 
02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
simultaneously but if you did like a
 
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
layway and you waited a month to pick up
 
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
delivery should maybe you have to pay a
 
02:18:59.070 --> 02:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
storage fee from them holding on to your
 
02:19:01.270 --> 02:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
your should be in the contract that
 
02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:02.309 align:start position:0%
your should be in the contract that
should

02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
should
 
02:19:04.469 --> 02:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
be well we would write it in the bill
 
02:19:06.429 --> 02:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
this this is not a contract situation
 
02:19:09.270 --> 02:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
this is not you're he paid but he says
 
02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
okay I'm paying I'm going to give you
 
02:19:12.669 --> 02:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
this money and but I don't want you to
 
02:19:14.910 --> 02:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
deliver it until two months from now
 
02:19:16.349 --> 02:19:16.359 align:start position:0%
well I don't I don't know if an oil
 
02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
company would do that so I think you're
 
02:19:19.950 --> 02:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
you're well that's what I'm saying
 
02:19:21.629 --> 02:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
because we started out with you had this
 
02:19:24.030 --> 02:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
simple little scenario a couple of days
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
yes and then I said well what about but
 
02:19:27.790 --> 02:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
and you said well what happens if it's a
 
02:19:31.469 --> 02:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
month later okay so if if it is a month
 
02:19:33.950 --> 02:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
later let's say that it is some you have
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
a bunch of bunch of constituents bunch
 
02:19:38.270 --> 02:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
of people who really pay attention to
 
02:19:40.389 --> 02:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
the oil company and the oil company puts
 
02:19:42.910 --> 02:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
out an outrageously row low price that
 
02:19:45.309 --> 02:19:45.319 align:start position:0%
day okay and everybody says oh yeah
 
02:19:46.669 --> 02:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
let's get in on that let's get in on
 
02:19:49.870 --> 02:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
that now that company has got to hold
 
02:19:52.870 --> 02:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
that oil for that you know period of
 
02:19:54.349 --> 02:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
time that person says but I don't want
 
02:19:57.389 --> 02:19:57.399 align:start position:0%
delivery yet my tank is full I want to
 
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
lock in that price for you to deliver to
 
02:20:02.429 --> 02:20:02.439 align:start position:0%
me a month so so it's a it's a
 
02:20:04.510 --> 02:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
fascinating hypothetical that I cannot
 
02:20:07.270 --> 02:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
imagine actually occurring because no
 
02:20:10.429 --> 02:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
rational Oil Company would would offer
 
02:20:13.230 --> 02:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
that proposition or would put them
 
02:20:15.190 --> 02:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
themselves at risk for that long but if
 
02:20:18.750 --> 02:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
they did they should be bound
 
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
they should be
 
02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
bound so you said on year later I want
 
02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
you I want to lock in this price for
 
02:20:28.349 --> 02:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
next year it's not the purpose of our
 
02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
consumer protection statutes to protect
 
02:20:35.910 --> 02:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
the provider of the oil from idiotic
 
02:20:39.150 --> 02:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
marketing decisions it's the purpose to
 
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
protect the consumer from being taken
 
02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
advantage okay so so I'm saying is I
 
02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with your issue
 
02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
yeah it but it if as long as the
 
02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:51.319 align:start position:0%
delivery date is within a week but when
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
you start pushing the delivery date out
 
02:20:56.590 --> 02:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
I do think you're creating uh you're
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
creating a a a more problematic
 
02:21:04.590 --> 02:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
solution if you put a date on it I think
 
02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
the stat the the bill is still worth
 
02:21:09.550 --> 02:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
passing great if you put a date on it I
 
02:21:11.309 --> 02:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
would think two weeks might be a little
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
bit more sensible okay I don't think you
 
02:21:16.190 --> 02:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
need to put a date on it right uh
 
02:21:18.550 --> 02:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
because I think that oil companies won't
 
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
offer to hold the oil for longer periods
 
02:21:22.950 --> 02:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
of time they only have so much storage I
 
02:21:24.670 --> 02:21:24.680 align:start position:0%
think I would assume okay representative
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
weeks no I just I think it's I it's
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
let's leave that as they used to say in
 
02:21:38.190 --> 02:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
my town gr leave it go let but I have a
 
02:21:42.429 --> 02:21:42.439 align:start position:0%
question and that is if uh this is this
 
02:21:44.230 --> 02:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
has occurred you've told us that this
 
02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:45.070 align:start position:0%
has occurred you've told us that this
has

02:21:45.070 --> 02:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
occurred has this been tested it all in
 
02:21:51.630 --> 02:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
the in the courts has somebody said I
 
02:21:55.830 --> 02:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
agreed to pay such and such for so much
 
02:21:59.469 --> 02:21:59.479 align:start position:0%
oil the company agreed I agreed I paid
 
02:22:01.389 --> 02:22:01.399 align:start position:0%
and then when they delivered two days
 
02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
later they charged me they sent me a
 
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
bill for the difference has anybody bed
 
02:22:08.590 --> 02:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
at this and
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
lost I don't know I haven't done that
 
02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
research well does that mean that
 
02:22:15.630 --> 02:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
they've actually paid and then said
 
02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
nothing and complain I would bet
 
02:22:19.469 --> 02:22:19.479 align:start position:0%
and we have someone come up here who
 
02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
will testify tell us why this is a bad
 
02:22:24.750 --> 02:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
Bill okay he's opposed to it but I will
 
02:22:27.349 --> 02:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
bet that the oil company said to the
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
consumer at the
 
02:22:33.429 --> 02:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
time that we can't guarantee this price
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
if you wait to if you're waiting for a
 
02:22:38.349 --> 02:22:38.359 align:start position:0%
later delivery other words you're you're
 
02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
but what we're going to do is we're
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
going to treat your payment as a
 
02:22:47.309 --> 02:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
deposit but that it could be higher if
 
02:22:49.990 --> 02:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
that by the time we delivered it to you
 
02:22:52.750 --> 02:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
because you're asking for a week or
 
02:22:56.270 --> 02:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
whatever that it could be hire so be be
 
02:22:58.590 --> 02:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
prepared for it to might be H since I'm
 
02:23:00.469 --> 02:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
testifying in part on my personal
 
02:23:02.630 --> 02:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
experience I can assure you that no such
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
representation or even a hint of it has
 
02:23:07.469 --> 02:23:07.479 align:start position:0%
ever been made there you go
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right we do have another
 
02:23:12.830 --> 02:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
question remember M thank you Mr
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
chairman so was it at your request that
 
02:23:18.429 --> 02:23:18.439 align:start position:0%
that the delivery was LA or would you
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
have taken it at the time of payment
 
02:23:21.670 --> 02:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
like say they had a truck in the
 
02:23:23.429 --> 02:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
neighborhood like two houses down and
 
02:23:25.630 --> 02:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
you just happen to call them you you
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
consummate the sale fully completed
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
right offer acceptance payment whatever
 
02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
and they so we'll be there in five
 
02:23:33.790 --> 02:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
minutes that's a very good question I'll
 
02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
I'll just testify in terms of my
 
02:23:37.030 --> 02:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
personal experience rather than trying
 
02:23:40.110 --> 02:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
to characterize a lot of disparate
 
02:23:42.670 --> 02:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
situations in charl
 
02:23:47.150 --> 02:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
town my oil company delivers once weekly
 
02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
and you can only get a delivery on
 
02:23:52.630 --> 02:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
Thursday if you choose to be a will call
 
02:23:55.309 --> 02:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
customer you're watching your oil tank
 
02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
you're gauging how much you're going to
 
02:23:59.630 --> 02:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
need how much your Tank's going to take
 
02:24:01.230 --> 02:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
you're making your own commercial
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
decision you may even be watching the
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
fluctuations of the prices dayto day and
 
02:24:09.349 --> 02:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
decide which day to make the call and
 
02:24:11.389 --> 02:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
you may decide to call the Friday before
 
02:24:13.950 --> 02:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
or the Tuesday to get a delivery for
 
02:24:17.990 --> 02:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
that cycle so it is entirely
 
02:24:21.070 --> 02:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
based on the limitations of delivery and
 
02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that if it were up to me
 
02:24:27.230 --> 02:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
and I could wave a wand and have the oil
 
02:24:30.110 --> 02:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
delivered the day I paid I would be
 
02:24:33.630 --> 02:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
delighted but you have to work within
 
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
the logistical constraints that the oil
 
02:24:38.190 --> 02:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
company presents
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
you yeah so so so essentially if I
 
02:24:42.830 --> 02:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly you'd like to
 
02:24:47.230 --> 02:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
shift the risk from the consumer to to
 
02:24:51.429 --> 02:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
the other commodity the commodity
 
02:24:54.309 --> 02:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
broker the risk on the fluctuating price
 
02:24:56.910 --> 02:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
I I'd like the risk I I shift I'm going
 
02:24:58.950 --> 02:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
to I'm going to hesitate to adopt that
 
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
word when the sale is
 
02:25:06.590 --> 02:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
concluded the risk is on the oil company
 
02:25:09.269 --> 02:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
under this bill and and they get to
 
02:25:10.630 --> 02:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
decide which day they're going to serve
 
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
your town um imagine the payment on a
 
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
pre-bi contract in July and and then the
 
02:25:19.870 --> 02:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
oil company can change the price on you
 
02:25:21.630 --> 02:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
it defeats the whole point of the pre-
 
02:25:24.269 --> 02:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
buby so if the consequence of this
 
02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
legislation is that they will refuse to
 
02:25:29.790 --> 02:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
do business with you or say it's only a
 
02:25:32.710 --> 02:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
deposit would this bill still be worth
 
02:25:34.990 --> 02:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
it well I do think the bill would be
 
02:25:37.950 --> 02:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
worth it I I think it's it's an improper
 
02:25:40.750 --> 02:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
contractual relationship that should be
 
02:25:43.269 --> 02:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
illegal uh what they may do as a
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
reaction uh shutting off customers and
 
02:25:48.510 --> 02:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
so on May may require further thought if
 
02:25:49.990 --> 02:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
it if that actually
 
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
unfolds okay thank you very much thank
 
02:25:54.990 --> 02:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
Rob we have
 
02:26:03.469 --> 02:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:07.150 --> 02:26:07.160 align:start position:0%
okay yeah now you're gonna be brief yeah
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
okay I've been I've been adequately
 
02:26:11.110 --> 02:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
cautioned thank you no that the last
 
02:26:14.429 --> 02:26:14.439 align:start position:0%
part was brief then we're worried
 
02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm all about it we support it
 
02:26:19.070 --> 02:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
will'll work with you but the when you
 
02:26:21.910 --> 02:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
talk about risk I'm I know that you are
 
02:26:24.269 --> 02:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
un people in general are unaware of the
 
02:26:27.070 --> 02:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
risk behind that transaction the product
 
02:26:30.830 --> 02:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
in a storage tank is generally part of a
 
02:26:33.150 --> 02:26:33.160 align:start position:0%
supply contract that the dealer is held
 
02:26:36.269 --> 02:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
to and it is monetized every single day
 
02:26:38.190 --> 02:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
every minute of every day that the
 
02:26:41.070 --> 02:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
commodity is trading the value of the
 
02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
oil in storage is monetized by a market
 
02:26:48.510 --> 02:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
price we you can't ask us to hold a
 
02:26:50.670 --> 02:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
price forever if you are not willing to
 
02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
take delivery without some other
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
discussion about a fee or some sort of
 
02:26:58.750 --> 02:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
risk instrument that that because that's
 
02:27:02.389 --> 02:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
what we do we hedge retail fuel in our
 
02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
storage tanks to prevent things like in
 
02:27:07.710 --> 02:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
2008 well that's what I'm saying go back
 
02:27:10.070 --> 02:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
to the thought was the reason Fuller
 
02:27:12.190 --> 02:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
went under but was all I heard was the
 
02:27:13.870 --> 02:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
Articles the articles I was reading is
 
02:27:16.750 --> 02:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
how this guy said I spent all day long
 
02:27:19.349 --> 02:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
all I'm doing is online dealing with my
 
02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
price and and this was an oil problem
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
not a gas problem it's it's not two
 
02:27:25.710 --> 02:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
cents and and in that in those market
 
02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
conditions which are could happen
 
02:27:31.070 --> 02:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
tomorrow the the price moved 60 cents in
 
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
a minute on the Commodities exchange we
 
02:27:36.349 --> 02:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
were buying in that environment if
 
02:27:37.990 --> 02:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
you're asking me to guarantee a price to
 
02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
profit margin by the way average retail
 
02:27:42.190 --> 02:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
profit margin that year 43 cents a
 
02:27:44.510 --> 02:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
gallon so I'm you're asking me to
 
02:27:46.110 --> 02:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
operate in a in a market where I can go
 
02:27:49.349 --> 02:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
upside down with no if if someone's dumb
 
02:27:51.150 --> 02:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
enough to do it we're going to be
 
02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
talking about other legislation to keep
 
02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
Bad actors from making promises they
 
02:27:56.990 --> 02:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
can't deliver we'll work with you you
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
got to there's got to be a limit a
 
02:28:00.990 --> 02:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
company like mine I turn my inventory
 
02:28:03.950 --> 02:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
every two days so it's monetized for two
 
02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
days and then I bring more in and the
 
02:28:07.309 --> 02:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
price changes and it changes throughout
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
the day our wholesalers there are only
 
02:28:11.469 --> 02:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
two in New Hampshire big wholesalers at
 
02:28:16.110 --> 02:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
the coast we get routinely midday price
 
02:28:17.710 --> 02:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
changes for product that we're going to
 
02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
pick up at the coast nothing I can do
 
02:28:21.510 --> 02:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
about that my truck can be in line about
 
02:28:23.630 --> 02:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
to load and they go nope 5 cents more
 
02:28:25.389 --> 02:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
boom just like that can be 10 cents more
 
02:28:27.269 --> 02:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
it can be 20 cents more it just doesn't
 
02:28:31.710 --> 02:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
work without timing so what is the right
 
02:28:33.830 --> 02:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
timing I mean for me it's a day it's
 
02:28:35.269 --> 02:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
today it's same day you want same day
 
02:28:36.389 --> 02:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
delivery you want to paid for it up
 
02:28:37.630 --> 02:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
front I'll give you a great price but
 
02:28:39.750 --> 02:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
you got to you got I got to transfer
 
02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise you're GNA say you can give
 
02:28:42.790 --> 02:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
your credit card but that's a deposit if
 
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
you want some wiggle room I I think that
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
the industry I don't speak for everyone
 
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
even though Dave and Bob I'll tell you I
 
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
do all the time a couple of days you
 
02:28:50.510 --> 02:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
know if I had the you know the whole
 
02:28:51.630 --> 02:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
Council here we go what do you guys want
 
02:28:53.670 --> 02:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
to do a couple of days we can hold it we
 
02:28:55.790 --> 02:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
can legitimately hedge that but the
 
02:28:58.389 --> 02:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
reality is that all goes to hell on a
 
02:29:00.269 --> 02:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
hand basket pardon my expression when
 
02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
you have a war that starts right and all
 
02:29:05.230 --> 02:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
of a sudden they go bam shut down the
 
02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
coast shut down trading and the next
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
time they open the spet for us to go
 
02:29:11.870 --> 02:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
load our trucks the pric is up 6070
 
02:29:14.389 --> 02:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
cents a gallon we have seen this happen
 
02:29:16.190 --> 02:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
it was part of what contributed to the
 
02:29:17.590 --> 02:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
failure that we talked about before
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
exactly okay now representative Terry do
 
02:29:23.309 --> 02:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
you want or you want oh okay repres
 
02:29:25.950 --> 02:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh if
 
02:29:29.309 --> 02:29:29.319 align:start position:0%
you I believe the answer is real simple
 
02:29:31.469 --> 02:29:31.479 align:start position:0%
if somebody calls you up and says I want
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
to give you I want 300 gallons of oil I
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
want to pay you today yes and I want you
 
02:29:39.230 --> 02:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
to deliver on Thursday all you got to
 
02:29:42.309 --> 02:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
say is I won't accept your money only
 
02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
going to price it on delivery it's it's
 
02:29:47.070 --> 02:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
that simple it's that simple you don't
 
02:29:48.990 --> 02:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
you don't make the
 
02:29:51.269 --> 02:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
deal I think that's what will happen if
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
we pass this
 
02:29:55.309 --> 02:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
bill so what that's what we do now and
 
02:29:56.750 --> 02:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's how my company operates
 
02:29:58.870 --> 02:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
you to to his point if you call me and
 
02:30:01.230 --> 02:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
my your delivery is next Thursday but I
 
02:30:02.910 --> 02:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
I know the risk I know what I have in
 
02:30:04.630 --> 02:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
storage I can calculate the risk in my
 
02:30:06.990 --> 02:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
head and I evaluate that 300 gallons at
 
02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario I occasionally sell
 
02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
a couple gallons of oil at a loss it
 
02:30:13.830 --> 02:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
happens all the time and then we make it
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
up on the next Buy on the next load it's
 
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
just part of how the margin dynamics of
 
02:30:22.429 --> 02:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
daily trading uh oil work okay great
 
02:30:24.870 --> 02:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
question oh represent
 
02:30:28.950 --> 02:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
SP the case that was brought to us was a
 
02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
case where the oil or gas what whatever
 
02:30:34.750 --> 02:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
commodity it was uh can only be
 
02:30:38.030 --> 02:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
delivered on Thursdays
 
02:30:41.309 --> 02:30:41.319 align:start position:0%
correct if that's the
 
02:30:44.670 --> 02:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
case are you suggesting that the person
 
02:30:47.190 --> 02:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
should only purchase the oil oil on a on
 
02:30:50.910 --> 02:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
an as call basis on Thursday morning or
 
02:30:52.830 --> 02:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
can they purchase it on
 
02:30:56.429 --> 02:30:56.439 align:start position:0%
Tuesday what order it on Tuesday but if
 
02:30:58.190 --> 02:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
he can't take
 
02:31:00.990 --> 02:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
THS be dely
 
02:31:03.790 --> 02:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
because he won't take your money you'll
 
02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
wait until they deliver it on that
 
02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
Thursday and they'll hang that coupon on
 
02:31:10.830 --> 02:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
your door and you'll pay in 30 days yeah
 
02:31:12.309 --> 02:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
I I I would I would evaluate the
 
02:31:14.110 --> 02:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
individual risk which is VE very simple
 
02:31:16.150 --> 02:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
for those of us that do this every day
 
02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's slam dunk I go great see you next
 
02:31:19.150 --> 02:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
Thursday there's your price you'll pay
 
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
what's on the ticket um in this case it
 
02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
is a you're you're prepaying me right
 
02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
now but you're not taking custody there
 
02:31:28.990 --> 02:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
is a company that's a it's not a startup
 
02:31:31.790 --> 02:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
they're owned by a big conglomerate
 
02:31:33.870 --> 02:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
operating in New Hampshire their whole
 
02:31:37.269 --> 02:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
platform is Click fill it's all online
 
02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's all prepaid the number one
 
02:31:42.710 --> 02:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
complaint from uh those customers are
 
02:31:45.309 --> 02:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
it's a great price but when I order they
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
don't show up for6 seven days and then
 
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
they change the price and I go well no
 
02:31:54.309 --> 02:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
kidding it's well that you can but but
 
02:31:57.030 --> 02:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
you and I think you should but it
 
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we need a law
 
02:32:02.750 --> 02:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
governing that because I have no crystal
 
02:32:04.950 --> 02:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
ball I cannot tell without without a
 
02:32:07.429 --> 02:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
time limit that you're you're allowing
 
02:32:09.710 --> 02:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
today I guess uh that company to say
 
02:32:10.990 --> 02:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
sure give me your money give me your
 
02:32:13.030 --> 02:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
credit card number see you next week and
 
02:32:14.510 --> 02:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
then they're changing the price someone
 
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
gets upset about it I
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to address that I
 
02:32:22.030 --> 02:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do that I would tell you I
 
02:32:23.750 --> 02:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
can't go that far out take delivery
 
02:32:26.110 --> 02:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or the next day no
 
02:32:29.349 --> 02:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
problem represented grassy yeah I I
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
think what I'm seeing in this bill and
 
02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about here and I I
 
02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
think makes sense and is that if someone
 
02:32:37.389 --> 02:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
was to order if I was to place an order
 
02:32:40.389 --> 02:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
for you for oil today yeah and I said
 
02:32:41.910 --> 02:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
and you give me a price this is what the
 
02:32:44.950 --> 02:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
oil is today but you say I can't deliver
 
02:32:48.269 --> 02:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
it until Monday right I shouldn't that
 
02:32:50.230 --> 02:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
price shouldn't change for
 
02:32:55.070 --> 02:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
me if I if I told you that I wanted to
 
02:32:57.910 --> 02:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
pay for G oil today but I don't want you
 
02:33:01.469 --> 02:33:01.479 align:start position:0%
to deliver it to me for two weeks now
 
02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
that's on me and if the price changes I
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
should be held responsible so in
 
02:33:07.389 --> 02:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
principle I I agree with you
 
02:33:09.510 --> 02:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative that if if I accept those
 
02:33:11.910 --> 02:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
terms as you laid them out it I am I am
 
02:33:13.950 --> 02:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
accepting that level of risk what I'm
 
02:33:15.710 --> 02:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
telling you is if you put that into into
 
02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
law I'm opposed to that because there's
 
02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
no time sensitive I don't want to be
 
02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
forced to because I if I make that
 
02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
decision I'm taking the risk but there
 
02:33:25.670 --> 02:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
are market conditions outside of my
 
02:33:27.550 --> 02:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
control that could cause me to say well
 
02:33:29.110 --> 02:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
are you going to support me when I say
 
02:33:31.110 --> 02:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
Force meure I can't do it because that's
 
02:33:32.590 --> 02:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
what that company's going to do F
 
02:33:35.230 --> 02:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
further question if if you have if you
 
02:33:37.630 --> 02:33:37.640 align:start position:0%
know if you take my order today yeah and
 
02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
and you may not have the trucks to get
 
02:33:41.389 --> 02:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
it out to me or whatever but you know
 
02:33:43.870 --> 02:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
you have that oil in stock or in your in
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
your tanks at your store you should
 
02:33:47.910 --> 02:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
should be able to honor that price for
 
02:33:51.070 --> 02:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
money or you can tell me I can't sell it
 
02:33:53.750 --> 02:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
to you today correct which is what I
 
02:33:55.630 --> 02:33:55.640 align:start position:0%
would tell you I would say I'm going to
 
02:33:58.550 --> 02:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
put you on a schedule at this price that
 
02:34:01.030 --> 02:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
dot dot dot if there are unforeseen
 
02:34:02.670 --> 02:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
market conditions I may not be able to
 
02:34:04.790 --> 02:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
it'll be but but guess what what if the
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
price goes down are you going to expect
 
02:34:07.830 --> 02:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
me to sell it to you at a lower price
 
02:34:09.630 --> 02:34:09.640 align:start position:0%
I'll answer for you you are because
 
02:34:12.150 --> 02:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's been my experience over my career
 
02:34:14.110 --> 02:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
so you can't have it both ways where
 
02:34:15.349 --> 02:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
you're asking me to take the risk I'll
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
take the risk if I sign up for it I'll
 
02:34:18.830 --> 02:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
take it you put it into a law I'm going
 
02:34:20.830 --> 02:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
to fight you on it 100% of the time
 
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
because I have to manage that risk for
 
02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
everyone and you're forcing me to I I
 
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
think that companies that enter into
 
02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
that agreement are wildly irresponsible
 
02:34:29.230 --> 02:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
they're doing it right now in New
 
02:34:31.230 --> 02:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you don't know it he's doing
 
02:34:32.750 --> 02:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
it because he got a great price I don't
 
02:34:34.510 --> 02:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
mean to speak for you but that's that's
 
02:34:36.790 --> 02:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
my experience right I go online I get a
 
02:34:38.550 --> 02:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
better price than yours Rob I go go
 
02:34:41.269 --> 02:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
ahead and then a week later they get the
 
02:34:42.710 --> 02:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
delivery price went up because they
 
02:34:44.230 --> 02:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
never call me if the price went down
 
02:34:45.429 --> 02:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
price goes up they get a new delivery
 
02:34:48.510 --> 02:34:48.520 align:start position:0%

establishments uh for the record I uh
 
03:42:13.630 --> 03:42:13.640 align:start position:0%
represent the good people of Carol
 
03:42:18.309 --> 03:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
County 8 uh and in my my private life I
 
03:42:21.229 --> 03:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
am a uh septic designer installer
 
03:42:24.429 --> 03:42:24.439 align:start position:0%
evaluator excavation run a family
 
03:42:26.269 --> 03:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
business we've been doing that for 30
 
03:42:28.790 --> 03:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
years and it's pretty much all that we
 
03:42:34.229 --> 03:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
do uh part of uh part of the of um my
 
03:42:37.070 --> 03:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
profession uh besides designing and
 
03:42:40.110 --> 03:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
installing is we do an enormous amount
 
03:42:43.349 --> 03:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
of Waterfront assessments for transfers
 
03:42:47.189 --> 03:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
of property for anything near a great
 
03:42:49.630 --> 03:42:49.640 align:start position:0%
body of water a fourth order stream and
 
03:42:52.590 --> 03:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
so forth and
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
um and I do a lot of work with the small
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
restaurants up in our area mom and pop
 
03:43:01.990 --> 03:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
operations um and there is literally no
 
03:43:04.550 --> 03:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
public sewer in my area I'm from the
 
03:43:06.750 --> 03:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
freedom area below
 
03:43:10.269 --> 03:43:10.279 align:start position:0%
Conway and Time After Time After Time
 
03:43:15.550 --> 03:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
time uh someone will purchase a um a
 
03:43:19.110 --> 03:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
diner um a small restaurant uh you might
 
03:43:22.990 --> 03:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
have 30 40 seats in it and chefs I find
 
03:43:25.950 --> 03:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
are very good at uh making food and
 
03:43:28.429 --> 03:43:28.439 align:start position:0%
understanding how they price things but
 
03:43:30.910 --> 03:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
most of most of the people uh that come
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
north have worked in locations that had
 
03:43:36.550 --> 03:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
public sewer and just took for granted
 
03:43:39.110 --> 03:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
when they bought a property and the and
 
03:43:41.309 --> 03:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
the the owner owner told them oh yes we
 
03:43:43.790 --> 03:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
have 100 seats and you might look inside
 
03:43:46.149 --> 03:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
the restaurant there might be 80 or 90
 
03:43:49.070 --> 03:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
seats but when it comes time to get
 
03:43:51.830 --> 03:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
their new uh their new license food
 
03:43:54.070 --> 03:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
license from the health department they
 
03:43:56.349 --> 03:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
ask for the most current septic design
 
03:43:59.229 --> 03:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
and at that time they find many times
 
03:44:01.469 --> 03:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
that they're not licensed for 100
 
03:44:04.870 --> 03:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
they're only licensed for 10 or 20 uh 20
 
03:44:08.469 --> 03:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
seats it becomes a huge problem I I end
 
03:44:11.309 --> 03:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
up going into at least 15 in my area
 
03:44:13.590 --> 03:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
trying to work it out with them with
 
03:44:15.910 --> 03:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
water meter readings and everything else
 
03:44:18.110 --> 03:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
and over the course of many years
 
03:44:20.590 --> 03:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
getting them up to maybe 40 seats when
 
03:44:22.110 --> 03:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
they thought they had a
 
03:44:26.269 --> 03:44:26.279 align:start position:0%
100 uh the second side of that um sword
 
03:44:30.030 --> 03:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
is people that purchase a waterfront
 
03:44:33.590 --> 03:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
property and their tax card may say they
 
03:44:35.550 --> 03:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
have four and five
 
03:44:38.950 --> 03:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
bedrooms and when they when they go to
 
03:44:40.670 --> 03:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
look into the records after they
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
purchased it they find that they bought
 
03:44:46.110 --> 03:44:46.120 align:start position:0%
a piece of land that big and all it will
 
03:44:47.910 --> 03:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
support is two bedrooms the
 
03:44:50.750 --> 03:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
grandfathered rate it becomes a big
 
03:44:53.710 --> 03:44:53.720 align:start position:0%
issue once again on what to do so when
 
03:44:55.710 --> 03:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
the department brought this forward to
 
03:44:59.910 --> 03:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
me it seems reasonable and um I see it
 
03:45:02.550 --> 03:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
as a great protection for the person
 
03:45:04.910 --> 03:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
purchasing property whether it be a food
 
03:45:07.469 --> 03:45:07.479 align:start position:0%
service or whether it be a
 
03:45:10.149 --> 03:45:10.159 align:start position:0%
residence and I'm speaking here in favor
 
03:45:15.030 --> 03:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:18.790 --> 03:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
chairman questions from the
 
03:45:23.670 --> 03:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
committee you work do you question do
 
03:45:26.309 --> 03:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
you work with uh closely with rainy P
 
03:45:29.790 --> 03:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
here at Dees with the Department yes dep
 
03:45:31.590 --> 03:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
yep we
 
03:45:34.790 --> 03:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
do he's been kicked upstairs he's he's
 
03:45:37.429 --> 03:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
running the show Rainey has been at it
 
03:45:40.070 --> 03:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
longer than your chairman yeah many and
 
03:45:41.990 --> 03:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
I are all friends cuz I I'm the only
 
03:45:45.389 --> 03:45:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:48.830 --> 03:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
dam so okay so uh one thing we have
 
03:45:51.389 --> 03:45:51.399 align:start position:0%
learned in this committee is that uh
 
03:45:53.149 --> 03:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
when you do Food Services you have to
 
03:45:55.910 --> 03:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
have a special septic system for the
 
03:45:58.269 --> 03:45:58.279 align:start position:0%
food waste and and that's stre different
 
03:46:00.110 --> 03:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
so but I guess what you're talking about
 
03:46:02.269 --> 03:46:02.279 align:start position:0%
now is just how many people you can have
 
03:46:04.710 --> 03:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
in the restaurant and that's more just
 
03:46:07.790 --> 03:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
the basic bathrooms not not even that
 
03:46:11.670 --> 03:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
food food service septics say right well
 
03:46:14.990 --> 03:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
they the majority of uh the restaurants
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
are sized by the number of people
 
03:46:20.110 --> 03:46:20.120 align:start position:0%
sitting and whether they're using if the
 
03:46:22.349 --> 03:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
restaurant is using China something
 
03:46:24.550 --> 03:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
that's washed or whether it's throw away
 
03:46:27.910 --> 03:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
right and so Mo many places got licensed
 
03:46:31.550 --> 03:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of years ago um you know saying
 
03:46:33.790 --> 03:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
they were going to be paper service only
 
03:46:37.349 --> 03:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
which is 20 gallons per day per seat but
 
03:46:39.189 --> 03:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
then you know your place doesn't look
 
03:46:41.710 --> 03:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
like uh the rits if you're giving them
 
03:46:44.269 --> 03:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
paper plates so they switched over to
 
03:46:48.590 --> 03:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
China and and the health yeah the health
 
03:46:51.990 --> 03:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
department for many many years wasn't
 
03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
monitoring this but now the department
 
03:46:57.070 --> 03:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
they and department environmental servic
 
03:47:00.630 --> 03:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
is very anxious because high strength uh
 
03:47:03.030 --> 03:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
sewage with grease and everything else
 
03:47:05.670 --> 03:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
is short circuiting and if you don't
 
03:47:07.830 --> 03:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
have enough land and this is as big as
 
03:47:11.910 --> 03:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
your Diner is you know that causes the
 
03:47:11.920 --> 03:47:14.269 align:start position:0%
your Diner is you know that causes the
problem

03:47:14.269 --> 03:47:14.279 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay seems simple
 
03:47:21.710 --> 03:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
enough thank you very much thank
 
03:47:27.790 --> 03:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:27.800 --> 03:47:38.510 align:start position:0%

03:48:30.349 --> 03:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to uh reiterate some of
 
03:48:34.469 --> 03:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
the things he said um but the so the
 
03:48:39.790 --> 03:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
current RSA um limits the information um
 
03:48:42.469 --> 03:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
that is required during a real estate
 
03:48:47.790 --> 03:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
transaction um currently uh information
 
03:48:49.710 --> 03:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
that's disclosed in a real estate
 
03:48:52.070 --> 03:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
transaction is only required for one to
 
03:48:53.550 --> 03:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
four family
 
03:48:56.389 --> 03:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
dwellings um and the information that's
 
03:49:00.990 --> 03:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
disclosed is is is uh includes the
 
03:49:02.429 --> 03:49:02.439 align:start position:0%
septic systems
 
03:49:04.950 --> 03:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
location any malfunctions that may have
 
03:49:07.990 --> 03:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
occurred in with the system and the the
 
03:49:11.550 --> 03:49:11.560 align:start position:0%
the uh contractor Andor pumper name and
 
03:49:13.590 --> 03:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
the service dates of the
 
03:49:15.950 --> 03:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
system and since I've been with it with
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
the dees subsurface Bureau um we receive
 
03:49:24.469 --> 03:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
inquiries um from folks after they've
 
03:49:27.469 --> 03:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
bought a property either residential or
 
03:49:29.389 --> 03:49:29.399 align:start position:0%
a restaurant being
 
03:49:34.149 --> 03:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
commercial and they are often surprised
 
03:49:37.469 --> 03:49:37.479 align:start position:0%
uh by the number of bedrooms um that
 
03:49:40.030 --> 03:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
their system will support
 
03:49:43.870 --> 03:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
um for a residential transaction and uh
 
03:49:46.590 --> 03:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
also they're often surprised to learn
 
03:49:48.670 --> 03:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
that they may not be able to increase
 
03:49:51.670 --> 03:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
the load on their system um due to the C
 
03:49:55.670 --> 03:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
due to uh the current design and
 
03:49:59.510 --> 03:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
property um for the sale uh for the sale
 
03:50:01.990 --> 03:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
of commercial uh Food Service
 
03:50:02.000 --> 03:50:04.309 align:start position:0%
of commercial uh Food Service
establishment

03:50:04.309 --> 03:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
03:50:06.550 --> 03:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
structures they are regulated based on
 
03:50:08.750 --> 03:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
the number of seats um that are
 
03:50:10.269 --> 03:50:10.279 align:start position:0%
physically in the
 
03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant and um in a few cases that
 
03:50:18.149 --> 03:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
I've been aware of um as Mark said um
 
03:50:21.149 --> 03:50:21.159 align:start position:0%
these folks uh don't don't understand
 
03:50:23.630 --> 03:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
what the septic system is they only know
 
03:50:26.670 --> 03:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
that it's out of sight out of mind and
 
03:50:28.389 --> 03:50:28.399 align:start position:0%
until it doesn't function correctly they
 
03:50:30.910 --> 03:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
don't pay attention to it but when they
 
03:50:33.590 --> 03:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
contact us they they ask if their system
 
03:50:37.550 --> 03:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
May support uh 100 seats like Mark said
 
03:50:40.030 --> 03:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
where and in some cases they may not
 
03:50:44.229 --> 03:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
have half those seats permitted for that
 
03:50:46.870 --> 03:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
establishment um and so we end up with
 
03:50:51.710 --> 03:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
some fairly upset owners new owners um
 
03:50:54.189 --> 03:50:54.199 align:start position:0%
that can't uh support their business
 
03:50:56.070 --> 03:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
with the increased number of
 
03:50:59.950 --> 03:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
seats um so the proposed the proposal
 
03:51:01.750 --> 03:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
for this is just
 
03:51:05.149 --> 03:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
that more detailed information be
 
03:51:06.910 --> 03:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
provided during the
 
03:51:09.750 --> 03:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
transactions um and that
 
03:51:12.870 --> 03:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
it'd be for all dwellings and uh Food
 
03:51:12.880 --> 03:51:14.349 align:start position:0%
it'd be for all dwellings and uh Food
Service

03:51:14.349 --> 03:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
Service
 
03:51:16.670 --> 03:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
establishments I think this is going to
 
03:51:19.630 --> 03:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
and the the idea of this the intent of
 
03:51:20.790 --> 03:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:51:24.149 --> 03:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
that a buyer would be given a copy of
 
03:51:26.950 --> 03:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
the operational approval which includes
 
03:51:30.229 --> 03:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
the design uh that's associated with the
 
03:51:31.910 --> 03:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
structure on the
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
property which give them an an improved
 
03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what he or she may be
 
03:51:38.159 --> 03:51:40.429 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what he or she may be
buying

03:51:40.429 --> 03:51:40.439 align:start position:0%
buying
 
03:51:43.710 --> 03:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
in the case of a uh residential
 
03:51:46.110 --> 03:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
transaction um the number of bedrooms
 
03:51:48.550 --> 03:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
are included on the design and they're
 
03:51:52.269 --> 03:51:52.279 align:start position:0%
also included on the uh construction uh
 
03:51:55.189 --> 03:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
approval and approval for operation that
 
03:52:00.110 --> 03:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:02.750 --> 03:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
receives for commercial construction
 
03:52:05.189 --> 03:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
operation uh construction and
 
03:52:08.189 --> 03:52:08.199 align:start position:0%
operational approvals um the number of
 
03:52:12.630 --> 03:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
seats is included on the design um and
 
03:52:12.640 --> 03:52:15.670 align:start position:0%
seats is included on the design um and
excuse

03:52:15.670 --> 03:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:18.870 --> 03:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
me and and typically the approvals and
 
03:52:21.389 --> 03:52:21.399 align:start position:0%
the copies of of the designs are sent to
 
03:52:25.590 --> 03:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
the towns via email or hard
 
03:52:29.269 --> 03:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
copy and to support all of uh all of the
 
03:52:33.149 --> 03:52:33.159 align:start position:0%
questions uh that a an owner Andor their
 
03:52:34.870 --> 03:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
agent may
 
03:52:37.790 --> 03:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
have the bureau has a is has an
 
03:52:40.030 --> 03:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
individual that is called the reviewer
 
03:52:44.189 --> 03:52:44.199 align:start position:0%
of the day which we we uh short for Rod
 
03:52:46.070 --> 03:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
and that person is dedicated every day
 
03:52:49.590 --> 03:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
to answer questions that may be received
 
03:52:52.469 --> 03:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
from uh new homeowners new business
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
owners Andor um real estate agents uh
 
03:53:00.950 --> 03:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
Andor sellers of property um we do get
 
03:53:03.389 --> 03:53:03.399 align:start position:0%
calls from sellers saying hey how many
 
03:53:06.349 --> 03:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
bedrooms is my system approved
 
03:53:10.349 --> 03:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
for um and so with all that said i' I'd
 
03:53:12.790 --> 03:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
welcome any
 
03:53:15.229 --> 03:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
questions all right questions
 
03:53:15.239 --> 03:53:16.950 align:start position:0%
questions all right questions
representative

03:53:16.950 --> 03:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:53:19.189 --> 03:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
burough thanks for taking my question
 
03:53:20.910 --> 03:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just more Curious uh what's the
 
03:53:23.590 --> 03:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
recourse for somebody like who buys a
 
03:53:26.070 --> 03:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
restaurant and find you know finds out
 
03:53:28.229 --> 03:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
that it's not going to not going to work
 
03:53:31.830 --> 03:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
according to what they wanted to do
 
03:53:35.389 --> 03:53:35.399 align:start position:0%
um so so like like Mark said earlier um
 
03:53:37.710 --> 03:53:37.720 align:start position:0%
their recourses they'd have they' they'd
 
03:53:41.670 --> 03:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
work with a license designer um to
 
03:53:45.429 --> 03:53:45.439 align:start position:0%
determine what their septic system um
 
03:53:49.269 --> 03:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
was permitted for and then they may have
 
03:53:53.229 --> 03:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
to do uh a new design to
 
03:53:58.349 --> 03:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
increase the the number of seats okay um
 
03:54:00.710 --> 03:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
so it's basically an unanticipated could
 
03:54:04.030 --> 03:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
be major expense it could be okay yes
 
03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
thanks representative
 
03:54:10.910 --> 03:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
crley yes uh thank you um the question I
 
03:54:13.590 --> 03:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
have is that if someone is buil if
 
03:54:15.389 --> 03:54:15.399 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to open up a restaurant
 
03:54:16.710 --> 03:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
or whatever whoever owned the place
 
03:54:18.309 --> 03:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
first wouldn't they have a certificate
 
03:54:20.269 --> 03:54:20.279 align:start position:0%
of occupancy which would list the
 
03:54:24.469 --> 03:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:27.670 --> 03:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
building that typically is is
 
03:54:31.309 --> 03:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
a ordinance associated with a town and I
 
03:54:32.910 --> 03:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with what the ordinance
 
03:54:36.030 --> 03:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
might be um okay maybe the maybe the
 
03:54:37.389 --> 03:54:37.399 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill could answer that
 
03:54:39.550 --> 03:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
question and I can I can you can either
 
03:54:43.510 --> 03:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
answer it now or or I know I know in in
 
03:54:46.910 --> 03:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
sopy um it was it was up to the zoning
 
03:54:50.910 --> 03:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
department to um determine the number of
 
03:54:54.110 --> 03:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
bedrooms and or number of seats in in a
 
03:54:57.389 --> 03:54:57.399 align:start position:0%
establishment however we did not have a
 
03:54:59.510 --> 03:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
certificate of occupancy in that town
 
03:55:00.790 --> 03:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
further question forther question yeah
 
03:55:02.189 --> 03:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
when when I know when projects are
 
03:55:04.229 --> 03:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
approved there's a subdivision approval
 
03:55:05.950 --> 03:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
which is done and usually they get
 
03:55:07.389 --> 03:55:07.399 align:start position:0%
approval from the state for so many
 
03:55:09.670 --> 03:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
bedrooms on the proper and if a business
 
03:55:11.630 --> 03:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
is open up they get a particularly a
 
03:55:13.590 --> 03:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
food service establishment they get a
 
03:55:16.149 --> 03:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
license to open up with so many seats
 
03:55:17.910 --> 03:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
and that should be public
 
03:55:20.830 --> 03:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
record that's correct and so there would
 
03:55:22.870 --> 03:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
be the ability to you know I'm just
 
03:55:24.030 --> 03:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out if there's a way we
 
03:55:26.229 --> 03:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
could link that better so that because I
 
03:55:27.510 --> 03:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
think if somebody is to buy a place and
 
03:55:29.469 --> 03:55:29.479 align:start position:0%
he was told there 100 seats in the place
 
03:55:32.030 --> 03:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
and the ctif oy says there's only 20
 
03:55:33.309 --> 03:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
seats in the place it's that would be
 
03:55:33.319 --> 03:55:35.469 align:start position:0%
seats in the place it's that would be
deceptive

03:55:35.469 --> 03:55:35.479 align:start position:0%
deceptive
 
03:55:38.550 --> 03:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
marketing would you believe so we uh for
 
03:55:40.510 --> 03:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
all of the commercial approvals that we
 
03:55:42.910 --> 03:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
we process all of those approvals are
 
03:55:44.990 --> 03:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
sent to the municipality by email or
 
03:55:50.349 --> 03:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:54.870 --> 03:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:58.110 --> 03:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
bullo how often do uh SE septic systems
 
03:56:03.590 --> 03:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
need to be um looked at um what's the
 
03:56:03.600 --> 03:56:04.990 align:start position:0%
need to be um looked at um what's the
word

03:56:04.990 --> 03:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
word
 
03:56:09.710 --> 03:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
inspected um so typically you should a
 
03:56:12.189 --> 03:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
person who um owns a septic system
 
03:56:15.149 --> 03:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
should be pumping their tanks every two
 
03:56:19.870 --> 03:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
years um and some people will say three
 
03:56:23.269 --> 03:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
um and during that time the the licensed
 
03:56:28.269 --> 03:56:28.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:31.990 --> 03:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
system okay who else representative M uh
 
03:56:35.229 --> 03:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
thank you um it's been my experience as
 
03:56:37.349 --> 03:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
a real estate agent that a lot of times
 
03:56:40.309 --> 03:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
this information is not available for an
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
older home um if you go to the town they
 
03:56:44.630 --> 03:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
probably don't have anything and so the
 
03:56:46.950 --> 03:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
town says go to the state and a lot of
 
03:56:49.229 --> 03:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
times the state has no information on
 
03:56:52.429 --> 03:56:52.439 align:start position:0%
the septic system is there a way that an
 
03:56:55.830 --> 03:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
inspector could retroactively determine
 
03:56:58.189 --> 03:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
how many rooms should be uh associated
 
03:57:00.990 --> 03:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
with it and typically it's the it's the
 
03:57:04.070 --> 03:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
buyer who is the one who opts to have
 
03:57:07.229 --> 03:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
the system inspected I sellers normally
 
03:57:09.830 --> 03:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
don't do that right
 
03:57:12.590 --> 03:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
great question um
 
03:57:16.870 --> 03:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
so to answer the first part um the the
 
03:57:20.030 --> 03:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
dees subsurface Bureau has an archive
 
03:57:23.510 --> 03:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
system archive where um we go back to
 
03:57:27.110 --> 03:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
1967 with the if there is an approval um
 
03:57:31.189 --> 03:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
and people can request an archive review
 
03:57:33.269 --> 03:57:33.279 align:start position:0%
to see if there is an approved
 
03:57:36.750 --> 03:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
system if there is not an approved
 
03:57:39.830 --> 03:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
system um and in inspection by a
 
03:57:42.309 --> 03:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
licensed designer can be done and the
 
03:57:46.229 --> 03:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
licensed designer can determine um the
 
03:57:48.830 --> 03:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
the existing system components and the
 
03:57:51.030 --> 03:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh either the number of bedrooms that
 
03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
the system would support or the number
 
03:57:55.309 --> 03:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
of seats that uh the system would
 
03:57:58.269 --> 03:57:58.279 align:start position:0%
support for commercial
 
03:58:00.990 --> 03:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
development I have another question oh
 
03:58:03.510 --> 03:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
represent buam I have another question
 
03:58:06.269 --> 03:58:06.279 align:start position:0%
about um certain bedrooms I mean the
 
03:58:08.670 --> 03:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
amount the amount of uh bed bedrooms um
 
03:58:11.670 --> 03:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
um in a um most of them that you're
 
03:58:14.590 --> 03:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
talking about are Cottages camps um if a
 
03:58:16.630 --> 03:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
person buys a a piece of property and
 
03:58:18.950 --> 03:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
there's two bedrooms um let's say it's
 
03:58:22.429 --> 03:58:22.439 align:start position:0%
on you know one of the designated Rivers
 
03:58:25.870 --> 03:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh close to you know the the Waterway um
 
03:58:29.349 --> 03:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
what's to prevent them from putting in
 
03:58:32.469 --> 03:58:32.479 align:start position:0%
you know two other bedrooms is is there
 
03:58:35.670 --> 03:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
a uh notification well maybe this bill
 
03:58:39.189 --> 03:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
is what you need to let them know that
 
03:58:41.670 --> 03:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
you can only have two bedrooms here how
 
03:58:45.070 --> 03:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
is that prevented now you articulated
 
03:58:49.510 --> 03:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
that very well um so yes this bill would
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
provide them with the information that
 
03:58:54.070 --> 03:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
is necessary to determine what that
 
03:58:56.229 --> 03:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
system is approved
 
03:58:59.189 --> 03:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
for there is there are rules that
 
03:59:02.309 --> 03:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
require um a new system design if you're
 
03:59:04.950 --> 03:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
going to increase the use which is part
 
03:59:06.510 --> 03:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
of that is if you're going to go from
 
03:59:08.550 --> 03:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
two bedrooms to three that's an
 
03:59:10.469 --> 03:59:10.479 align:start position:0%
increased load on your system which
 
03:59:15.830 --> 03:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:18.590 --> 03:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
application so I always learn something
 
03:59:20.750 --> 03:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
new every day because I see a lot of
 
03:59:22.990 --> 03:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
lakefront properties in my town which
 
03:59:24.590 --> 03:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
they're all seem to say
 
03:59:27.229 --> 03:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
three so the three would they had to be
 
03:59:29.349 --> 03:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
design three cuz you're when you said
 
03:59:31.950 --> 03:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
two two is the default the assumption is
 
03:59:35.189 --> 03:59:35.199 align:start position:0%
that any septic system is only a two
 
03:59:37.550 --> 03:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
unless you can document it it was a
 
03:59:37.560 --> 03:59:41.830 align:start position:0%
unless you can document it it was a
three

03:59:41.830 --> 03:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:43.790 --> 03:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
is is two a default is that what you
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
said I just two is um depending on the
 
03:59:51.590 --> 03:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
scenario two is is the minimum size that
 
03:59:55.389 --> 03:59:55.399 align:start position:0%
A system can be designed for okay um and
 
03:59:57.590 --> 03:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
then you know if it's going to be
 
03:59:59.750 --> 03:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
designed for more than that you have the
 
04:00:02.110 --> 04:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
the size is going to increase the size
 
04:00:05.389 --> 04:00:05.399 align:start position:0%
of the system may increase so but if I
 
04:00:07.790 --> 04:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
bought a house that was built prior to
 
04:00:07.800 --> 04:00:10.910 align:start position:0%
bought a house that was built prior to
67

04:00:10.910 --> 04:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:13.389 --> 04:00:13.399 align:start position:0%
and if and it seem seemingly only has
 
04:00:17.070 --> 04:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
two bedrooms I can pretty much assume it
 
04:00:19.429 --> 04:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
was a two-bedroom
 
04:00:22.309 --> 04:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
system um if if there were no
 
04:00:24.630 --> 04:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
documentation on file with the archives
 
04:00:27.830 --> 04:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
and you had you um had a licensed
 
04:00:30.429 --> 04:00:30.439 align:start position:0%
designer um investigate the lot
 
04:00:32.990 --> 04:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
investigate what still have to design
 
04:00:34.710 --> 04:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
yeah you would have to you would have to
 
04:00:37.710 --> 04:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
uh hire a license designer to determine
 
04:00:39.710 --> 04:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
what that lot would support and it may
 
04:00:39.720 --> 04:00:40.910 align:start position:0%
what that lot would support and it may
support

04:00:40.910 --> 04:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:00:44.830 --> 04:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
more fair enough okay great any other
 
04:00:46.349 --> 04:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
questions to the
 
04:00:50.309 --> 04:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thank
 
04:00:52.630 --> 04:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
you all right moving right along because
 
04:00:55.110 --> 04:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
we're behind uh House Bill
 
04:01:07.229 --> 04:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:07.239 --> 04:01:27.469 align:start position:0%
 
Mons

04:01:27.469 --> 04:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:29.630 --> 04:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh good
 
04:01:31.790 --> 04:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee thank
 
04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
you all for the work that you do uh for
 
04:01:36.429 --> 04:01:36.439 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Chris muns I am
 
04:01:38.590 --> 04:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
one of the four represent atives
 
04:01:39.910 --> 04:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
representing the town of Hampton and
 
04:01:41.429 --> 04:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
Rockham District
 
04:01:43.710 --> 04:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
29 I was a member of this committee
 
04:01:46.189 --> 04:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
between 2012 and 2014 and I'm happy to
 
04:01:48.830 --> 04:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
be back with you today I'm here to
 
04:01:52.070 --> 04:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 1320 of which I'm the prime
 
04:01:54.910 --> 04:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor just within the last six months
 
04:01:57.030 --> 04:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
we have seen unprecedented amounts of
 
04:01:59.309 --> 04:01:59.319 align:start position:0%
flooding in our state not just on the
 
04:02:02.110 --> 04:02:02.120 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast as occurred earlier this month
 
04:02:03.469 --> 04:02:03.479 align:start position:0%
but in communities in the White
 
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
Mountains Lakes Region and mannok region
 
04:02:09.870 --> 04:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
during June and July of last year this
 
04:02:11.429 --> 04:02:11.439 align:start position:0%
flooding not only resulted in millions
 
04:02:13.309 --> 04:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
of dollars of damage but disrupted the
 
04:02:15.149 --> 04:02:15.159 align:start position:0%
lives of thousands hundreds if not
 
04:02:17.630 --> 04:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
thousands of our fellow citizens many of
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
whom are constituents of those in those
 
04:02:20.790 --> 04:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
of us in the
 
04:02:23.229 --> 04:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
room sadly many of them were probably
 
04:02:25.349 --> 04:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
taken by surprise they had no idea they
 
04:02:27.990 --> 04:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
lived in or near a flood zone that is
 
04:02:30.110 --> 04:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
what this bill is attempting to
 
04:02:33.389 --> 04:02:33.399 align:start position:0%
address in 2020 the First Street
 
04:02:35.590 --> 04:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
Foundation published a report entitled
 
04:02:37.830 --> 04:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
the first national flood risk assessment
 
04:02:40.389 --> 04:02:40.399 align:start position:0%
to find finding America's growing risk
 
04:02:42.349 --> 04:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
included along with a written copy of my
 
04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
testimony as a copy of the pages from
 
04:02:46.110 --> 04:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
that report covering New
 
04:02:49.710 --> 04:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 2020 FEMA estimated that
 
04:02:52.229 --> 04:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
29,000 properties in New Hampshire were
 
04:02:54.389 --> 04:02:54.399 align:start position:0%
at substantial risk of damage from
 
04:02:56.630 --> 04:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
flooding in their report the First
 
04:02:59.550 --> 04:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
Street Foundation believes that number
 
04:03:01.630 --> 04:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
is understated and estimates that the
 
04:03:06.070 --> 04:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
number of properties is closer to 64,000
 
04:03:08.149 --> 04:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
64,900 that is equivalent to a
 
04:03:10.990 --> 04:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 11.1% of all properties in
 
04:03:13.110 --> 04:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and that Pro and that
 
04:03:15.229 --> 04:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
percentage is higher than the overall
 
04:03:17.910 --> 04:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
National percentage of
 
04:03:20.309 --> 04:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
10.3% we have no way of knowing whether
 
04:03:22.030 --> 04:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
the owners or renters of these
 
04:03:23.309 --> 04:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
properties know that they are at
 
04:03:26.309 --> 04:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
substantial risk of flooding for Renters
 
04:03:28.710 --> 04:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
of property there are little or no
 
04:03:30.429 --> 04:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
protections against waking up one
 
04:03:33.189 --> 04:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
morning to find to your surprise your
 
04:03:35.469 --> 04:03:35.479 align:start position:0%
water your car underwater in the flooded
 
04:03:38.510 --> 04:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
parking lot outside your apartment or
 
04:03:40.550 --> 04:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
worse yet your downstairs or basement
 
04:03:43.429 --> 04:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
flooded at the present time the only
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
reference to flooding is a potential
 
04:03:46.870 --> 04:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
risk to a potential purchaser of
 
04:03:49.870 --> 04:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
property is a suggestion in paragraph 15
 
04:03:51.389 --> 04:03:51.399 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Association of
 
04:03:53.349 --> 04:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
Realtors standard purchase and sale
 
04:03:56.149 --> 04:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
agreement that a buyer determine that
 
04:03:57.950 --> 04:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
determine the availability and cost of
 
04:04:00.110 --> 04:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
flood insurance as part of their due
 
04:04:02.590 --> 04:04:02.600 align:start position:0%
diligence a copy of that form is also
 
04:04:04.870 --> 04:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
included with my written remarks there
 
04:04:06.790 --> 04:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
is no requirement that the seller share
 
04:04:08.590 --> 04:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
any information about pre previous flood
 
04:04:11.389 --> 04:04:11.399 align:start position:0%
damage and or whether the property is in
 
04:04:13.790 --> 04:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
a designated flood
 
04:04:16.830 --> 04:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
zone there is however a requirement that
 
04:04:18.630 --> 04:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
any buyer who purchases a home in a
 
04:04:21.030 --> 04:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
flood zone and applies for a mortgage to
 
04:04:23.149 --> 04:04:23.159 align:start position:0%
do so must purchase flood
 
04:04:25.630 --> 04:04:25.640 align:start position:0%
insurance unfortunately this sometimes
 
04:04:27.670 --> 04:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
is the first time a buyer learns that
 
04:04:29.469 --> 04:04:29.479 align:start position:0%
the property they want to purchase is in
 
04:04:32.389 --> 04:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
a flood zone since flood insurance is
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
expensive and becoming more so this
 
04:04:36.510 --> 04:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
often makes it more difficult or
 
04:04:38.590 --> 04:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
impossible for the prospective buyer to
 
04:04:40.269 --> 04:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
afford the resulting higher than
 
04:04:43.030 --> 04:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
expected monthly mortgage property tax
 
04:04:45.469 --> 04:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
and insurance payments and they end up
 
04:04:47.189 --> 04:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
having to back out of the transaction
 
04:04:49.349 --> 04:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
they had invested significant time money
 
04:04:51.710 --> 04:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
energy and emotional ups and downs
 
04:04:55.229 --> 04:04:55.239 align:start position:0%
in committing to a lease or purchase
 
04:04:56.670 --> 04:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
committing to lease or purchase a
 
04:04:58.710 --> 04:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
property is one of the largest financial
 
04:05:00.510 --> 04:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
investments any individual will make in
 
04:05:02.990 --> 04:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
their lifetime the purpose of this bill
 
04:05:04.830 --> 04:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
is to ensure the prospective renters and
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
purchasers of property in New Hampshire
 
04:05:09.269 --> 04:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
have a fair and full understanding of
 
04:05:10.630 --> 04:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
the conditions of the property they
 
04:05:12.670 --> 04:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
lease or purchase as it relates to flood
 
04:05:15.309 --> 04:05:15.319 align:start position:0%
risk and any prior damage caused by
 
04:05:16.790 --> 04:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
flooding or storm events and the
 
04:05:19.469 --> 04:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
potential liability they may be assuming
 
04:05:21.910 --> 04:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
by entering into a lease or purchase
 
04:05:24.389 --> 04:05:24.399 align:start position:0%
agreement due to timing constraints
 
04:05:25.830 --> 04:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
encountered when the bill was being
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
drafted the original version of the bill
 
04:05:30.750 --> 04:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
contained some drafting errors I have
 
04:05:32.790 --> 04:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
worked with OS to address those issues
 
04:05:35.189 --> 04:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
and have attached Amendment
 
04:05:35.199 --> 04:05:36.870 align:start position:0%
and have attached Amendment
2024

04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
2024
 
04:05:39.750 --> 04:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
01968 H which is co-sponsored by
 
04:05:41.750 --> 04:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative grassy to my written
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
testimony as you deliber deliberate on
 
04:05:45.910 --> 04:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
this bill I urge you to focus your
 
04:05:47.429 --> 04:05:47.439 align:start position:0%
efforts on that Amendment rather than
 
04:05:49.710 --> 04:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
the original version of the bill the
 
04:05:51.750 --> 04:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
amendment reflects the original intent
 
04:05:53.149 --> 04:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:05:55.030 --> 04:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
legislation before I speak to the
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
specifics of the bill I would like to
 
04:05:58.149 --> 04:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
acknowledge and thank the New Hampshire
 
04:06:00.189 --> 04:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors and the New
 
04:06:02.149 --> 04:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rental Property Owners
 
04:06:04.349 --> 04:06:04.359 align:start position:0%
Association for their time and input
 
04:06:06.750 --> 04:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
into this bill they were very helpful in
 
04:06:09.349 --> 04:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
in identifying issues and concerns which
 
04:06:12.309 --> 04:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
I did consider in drafting the bill the
 
04:06:14.790 --> 04:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
amended Bill does two things first it
 
04:06:17.349 --> 04:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
adds a disclosure of FL flood Risk by
 
04:06:19.710 --> 04:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
sellers of property to prospective
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
buyers because the real the realtors
 
04:06:23.590 --> 04:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
association was concerned about creating
 
04:06:25.229 --> 04:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
yet another former writer that would
 
04:06:27.510 --> 04:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
have to be signed and executed the
 
04:06:29.670 --> 04:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirement would be added to
 
04:06:29.680 --> 04:06:31.229 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirement would be added to
RSA

04:06:31.229 --> 04:06:31.239 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:06:34.630 --> 04:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
477 colon
 
04:06:37.469 --> 04:06:37.479 align:start position:0%
4-a like the existing requirements to
 
04:06:39.670 --> 04:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
discl Clos the presence of radon Arsenic
 
04:06:41.389 --> 04:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
and lead by sellers of property to
 
04:06:41.399 --> 04:06:43.070 align:start position:0%
and lead by sellers of property to
prospective

04:06:43.070 --> 04:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
prospective
 
04:06:45.149 --> 04:06:45.159 align:start position:0%
purchasers these disclosures are
 
04:06:47.030 --> 04:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
included are currently included in
 
04:06:49.710 --> 04:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph 12 on page two of the standard
 
04:06:51.750 --> 04:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
purchase and sale agreement if the
 
04:06:53.750 --> 04:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
amended bill is adopted I would Envision
 
04:06:55.750 --> 04:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
that paragraph being updated to also
 
04:06:58.630 --> 04:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
include the required flood risk
 
04:07:00.670 --> 04:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
disclosure the second thing the amended
 
04:07:03.910 --> 04:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
Bill does is also require lessor or
 
04:07:06.750 --> 04:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
owners of property to disclose the risk
 
04:07:09.550 --> 04:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
of flooding to Pur respective renters
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
the rental Property Owners Association
 
04:07:14.269 --> 04:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
had two concerns first they believed
 
04:07:16.630 --> 04:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
that if any require was to be imposed it
 
04:07:18.429 --> 04:07:18.439 align:start position:0%
should only imply to property with four
 
04:07:21.189 --> 04:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
or more units referred in statute as
 
04:07:23.870 --> 04:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
restricted property that is how the bill
 
04:07:26.790 --> 04:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
is drafted second they also were
 
04:07:28.070 --> 04:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about creating additional
 
04:07:30.030 --> 04:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
forms and paperwork so the bill is
 
04:07:31.870 --> 04:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
drafted such that the requirement to
 
04:07:34.870 --> 04:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
disclose FL flood risk can be satisfied
 
04:07:37.070 --> 04:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
by either including the the disclosure
 
04:07:40.109 --> 04:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
in the app an a lesser asks a
 
04:07:42.630 --> 04:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
prospective tenant to sign or through a
 
04:07:45.830 --> 04:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
very simple separate writer the bill
 
04:07:48.189 --> 04:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
also provides lessor who comply with the
 
04:07:50.670 --> 04:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirements truthfully with
 
04:07:53.109 --> 04:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
an exemption from claims of liability by
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
a tenant if the tenant ends up suffering
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
any damage to his or her personal
 
04:07:59.550 --> 04:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
property from
 
04:08:01.790 --> 04:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
flooding I am not suggesting that the
 
04:08:03.630 --> 04:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
realtors association or the rental
 
04:08:05.309 --> 04:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
Property Owners Association are
 
04:08:07.870 --> 04:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill I will leave that
 
04:08:10.389 --> 04:08:10.399 align:start position:0%
to them to discuss with you themselves
 
04:08:12.269 --> 04:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
but I did want to highlight that I have
 
04:08:13.830 --> 04:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
what I have done to try to address their
 
04:08:16.349 --> 04:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
concerns and I do hope they will support
 
04:08:19.389 --> 04:08:19.399 align:start position:0%
it or a version of this bill in either
 
04:08:21.030 --> 04:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
case I appreciate their help in
 
04:08:22.630 --> 04:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
educating me and hopefully creating a
 
04:08:22.640 --> 04:08:23.630 align:start position:0%
educating me and hopefully creating a
better

04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:08:26.070 --> 04:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
Bill not included in the amendment is
 
04:08:28.510 --> 04:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
some language I received yesterday that
 
04:08:31.750 --> 04:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
provides some protections for owners and
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
or Realtors who may rely on third
 
04:08:36.790 --> 04:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
parties to complete a flood ra Hazard
 
04:08:38.950 --> 04:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
determination for form or flood
 
04:08:41.429 --> 04:08:41.439 align:start position:0%
certificate for them I have also
 
04:08:43.269 --> 04:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
included that language with my written
 
04:08:45.030 --> 04:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and I urge you to consider
 
04:08:45.910 --> 04:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
that as
 
04:08:48.109 --> 04:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
well there's little we can do when
 
04:08:50.590 --> 04:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
flooding occurs luckily there is a
 
04:08:52.309 --> 04:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
growing amount of readily available
 
04:08:53.870 --> 04:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
information about where the greatest
 
04:08:55.349 --> 04:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
risks of flooding
 
04:08:57.870 --> 04:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
are some of you will no doubt say that
 
04:08:59.830 --> 04:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
it is up to the prospective buyer or
 
04:09:01.870 --> 04:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
renter to do their own due
 
04:09:05.149 --> 04:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
diligence I do not disagree with that as
 
04:09:07.269 --> 04:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
with any large transaction it is always
 
04:09:10.149 --> 04:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
best to do your own research but I would
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
also argue that it is incumbent upon the
 
04:09:14.750 --> 04:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
owner of the property to share all
 
04:09:17.229 --> 04:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
available information they have about
 
04:09:19.309 --> 04:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
the property as part of the transaction
 
04:09:21.670 --> 04:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
they are about to enter into the
 
04:09:23.710 --> 04:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
legislature has certainly said that
 
04:09:25.429 --> 04:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
should be the case with respect to
 
04:09:29.229 --> 04:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
disclosures about radon Arsenic and Lead
 
04:09:30.990 --> 04:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
given the devastation we have seen from
 
04:09:33.189 --> 04:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
flooding not just recently but over the
 
04:09:35.830 --> 04:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
years now is the time to add disclosures
 
04:09:39.030 --> 04:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
of potential flood risk to the that list
 
04:09:40.950 --> 04:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
it all it is also the time to provide
 
04:09:43.550 --> 04:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
renters with some peace of mind about
 
04:09:45.750 --> 04:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
the risks of damages from flooding they
 
04:09:46.630 --> 04:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
may be
 
04:09:51.189 --> 04:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
facing I urge you to recommend HB 1320
 
04:09:53.710 --> 04:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended and I would be
 
04:09:56.030 --> 04:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
happy to try to answer any of your
 
04:09:59.710 --> 04:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
questions the key word there being try
 
04:09:59.720 --> 04:10:01.670 align:start position:0%
questions the key word there being try
thank

04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:10:05.389 --> 04:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
you okay represent
 
04:10:09.229 --> 04:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
Willam um talking about renters uh
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
renting a piece of property that may be
 
04:10:13.149 --> 04:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
in a flood plane or flood flood zone and
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
has flooded
 
04:10:19.510 --> 04:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
um and and oftentimes if it has been
 
04:10:22.030 --> 04:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
flooded there probably will be some
 
04:10:27.309 --> 04:10:27.319 align:start position:0%
mold um which is a hazard so um I that's
 
04:10:29.870 --> 04:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
included in the bill or I mean that's
 
04:10:32.070 --> 04:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's what you're proposing is for the
 
04:10:34.750 --> 04:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
owner of the property to disclose to the
 
04:10:37.790 --> 04:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
renter that there might be some issues
 
04:10:41.349 --> 04:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
yeah what the bill does is it asks a um
 
04:10:45.109 --> 04:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
an owner to identify that the property
 
04:10:50.269 --> 04:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
is in a female flood zone and also to
 
04:10:53.590 --> 04:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
disclose any information that they have
 
04:10:56.630 --> 04:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
about previous flood damage um
 
04:11:00.109 --> 04:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
understanding that if someone only has
 
04:11:02.109 --> 04:11:02.119 align:start position:0%
owned the property for 10 years they may
 
04:11:04.149 --> 04:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
not have known what happened 20 years
 
04:11:06.670 --> 04:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
ago but at least share information that
 
04:11:09.790 --> 04:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
they know about know that they know of
 
04:11:12.469 --> 04:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
so that the prospective renter or the
 
04:11:14.630 --> 04:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
buyer goes into the transaction with
 
04:11:17.349 --> 04:11:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:20.189 --> 04:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
open okay represent
 
04:11:22.830 --> 04:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
Burrows just a quick question would this
 
04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
apply to a riverbank where there's been
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
erosion um where there's maybe not an
 
04:11:31.510 --> 04:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
imminent danger of flooding I know give
 
04:11:33.670 --> 04:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
you Anam a real life example my friends
 
04:11:35.830 --> 04:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
bought this house on a river didn't do a
 
04:11:37.830 --> 04:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
lot of due diligence and the at the
 
04:11:39.750 --> 04:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
River Bank eroded the house was actually
 
04:11:42.349 --> 04:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
in danger of of collapsing into the
 
04:11:43.950 --> 04:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
river would this cover
 
04:11:43.960 --> 04:11:45.630 align:start position:0%
river would this cover
it

04:11:45.630 --> 04:11:45.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:11:50.309 --> 04:11:50.319 align:start position:0%
um we tried to make the bill as um as
 
04:11:52.830 --> 04:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
objective as possible so the key is
 
04:11:55.670 --> 04:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
whether a property is in a designated
 
04:11:58.750 --> 04:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
flood zone so if that property is in a
 
04:12:01.229 --> 04:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
flood zone then yes it would apply if
 
04:12:03.590 --> 04:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
not then this doesn't really apply to
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
04:12:08.070 --> 04:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
you okay representa Amon
 
04:12:09.990 --> 04:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sher thank you for your
 
04:12:12.550 --> 04:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
well fought out testimony I think your
 
04:12:14.309 --> 04:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
testimony is a model of how testimony
 
04:12:16.349 --> 04:12:16.359 align:start position:0%
should be the way that you uh you
 
04:12:19.389 --> 04:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
structured it um I think the first
 
04:12:21.229 --> 04:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
question I had was how do you determine
 
04:12:22.830 --> 04:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
if your house is in a riverine I think I
 
04:12:25.750 --> 04:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
saw that um and and I think you answered
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
that with the it's a
 
04:12:31.389 --> 04:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
riverine uh so I'm looking at page one
 
04:12:34.349 --> 04:12:34.359 align:start position:0%
line 27 it says flooding properties in
 
04:12:36.630 --> 04:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
coastal or riverine areas may be subject
 
04:12:37.830 --> 04:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
to increased risk
 
04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
does that word riverine have any
 
04:12:40.399 --> 04:12:42.149 align:start position:0%
does that word riverine have any
legal

04:12:42.149 --> 04:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
legal
 
04:12:45.830 --> 04:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh is there um does it apply legally to
 
04:12:49.469 --> 04:12:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:52.030 --> 04:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
information I'm going to defer to my
 
04:12:53.910 --> 04:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
comment that I would try to answer
 
04:12:56.870 --> 04:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
questions um I I don't know I'm sure it
 
04:12:59.630 --> 04:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
has some legal definition somewhere but
 
04:13:02.670 --> 04:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
um it's not not what I I I don't I don't
 
04:13:04.630 --> 04:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
really know how it applies here okay and
 
04:13:06.670 --> 04:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
follow perhaps the chairman can my guess
 
04:13:09.630 --> 04:13:09.640 align:start position:0%
would be if a stream that is seasonal
 
04:13:11.870 --> 04:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
that you know because Ravine you know
 
04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
like California they have The Valleys
 
04:13:15.630 --> 04:13:15.640 align:start position:0%
that only when they're big seasonal
 
04:13:19.269 --> 04:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
runoff so it's it seemingly runs only
 
04:13:21.070 --> 04:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
when when it has heavy rain but that
 
04:13:22.870 --> 04:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
would be my guess that certainly works
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
for me quick followup followup uh this
 
04:13:31.030 --> 04:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
different question um you're requiring
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
that uh sellers of property disclose
 
04:13:36.550 --> 04:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
that there's a flooding event uh and
 
04:13:40.070 --> 04:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
also uh landlords to the renters what if
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh I purchase a house and I've only
 
04:13:44.870 --> 04:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
owned it a year but 10 years ago there
 
04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
was a big flood and then I go to sell it
 
04:13:49.269 --> 04:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
not knowing that that happened H how do
 
04:13:53.149 --> 04:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
you have a chain of custody of a log of
 
04:13:54.990 --> 04:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
all the events so that the proper
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
notification can
 
04:13:59.950 --> 04:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
happen um I I I think there's language
 
04:14:03.510 --> 04:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
in the in the bill that talks about um
 
04:14:06.309 --> 04:14:06.319 align:start position:0%
you know knowledge that you that you
 
04:14:09.469 --> 04:14:09.479 align:start position:0%
have in the time that you own the bill
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
or own the property um the intent
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
certainly is not that if you bought a
 
04:14:17.670 --> 04:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
property and own it for a year that you
 
04:14:20.309 --> 04:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for knowing what
 
04:14:23.550 --> 04:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
happened 10 20 30 years ago um I mean
 
04:14:25.950 --> 04:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
what we're asking buy sellers to do is
 
04:14:28.870 --> 04:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
if they have knowledge to share that to
 
04:14:33.030 --> 04:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:35.349 --> 04:14:35.359 align:start position:0%
buyer okay represent
 
04:14:37.830 --> 04:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
Herbert um
 
04:14:41.349 --> 04:14:41.359 align:start position:0%
how easy or or thorough or easy is it to
 
04:14:44.030 --> 04:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
get the flood plane
 
04:14:47.670 --> 04:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
information uh if you're an owner or or
 
04:14:49.990 --> 04:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
somebody who wants to buy I mean is that
 
04:14:52.229 --> 04:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
a difficult process I see a lot of
 
04:14:55.269 --> 04:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
Statistics here but I don't know if if
 
04:14:58.109 --> 04:14:58.119 align:start position:0%
uh I have I myself have never seen a
 
04:14:59.910 --> 04:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
flood plane uh
 
04:15:01.950 --> 04:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
map it's pretty it's pretty
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward and actually um State of
 
04:15:06.149 --> 04:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I I think it's the
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
department of of Economic Development
 
04:15:11.630 --> 04:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
has a site it's called a it's like a
 
04:15:14.070 --> 04:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
flood M plane management site you can
 
04:15:16.189 --> 04:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
actually go on there you type in your
 
04:15:18.149 --> 04:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
address and it'll show you if you're in
 
04:15:19.309 --> 04:15:19.319 align:start position:0%
a flood
 
04:15:19.319 --> 04:15:22.149 align:start position:0%
a flood
plane

04:15:22.149 --> 04:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
plane
 
04:15:23.990 --> 04:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
thanks can you I'm sorry I got
 
04:15:25.510 --> 04:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
distracted to say that
 
04:15:29.429 --> 04:15:29.439 align:start position:0%
again um the the state has a website and
 
04:15:31.630 --> 04:15:31.640 align:start position:0%
and and I can I can get the website to
 
04:15:33.910 --> 04:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
you all but I believe it's through the
 
04:15:36.710 --> 04:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Economic Development um
 
04:15:38.870 --> 04:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
and it's uh it's a flood plane
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
management um site and there's a tool
 
04:15:43.109 --> 04:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
there where you can actually type in
 
04:15:45.269 --> 04:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
your address and it'll show you a map
 
04:15:46.510 --> 04:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
and it'll tell you what flood plane
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
you're in so all someone has to do if
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to buy a property or rent
 
04:15:52.670 --> 04:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
a property is go to this web page and
 
04:15:55.590 --> 04:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
type that in and and and find out
 
04:15:57.590 --> 04:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
whether it's in a flood plane or not
 
04:15:59.109 --> 04:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
that that's all that a seller would have
 
04:16:04.269 --> 04:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
to do as well right so that but isn't
 
04:16:06.389 --> 04:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
this what the bill is all about the bill
 
04:16:09.109 --> 04:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
is about it it's it's disclosing whether
 
04:16:10.830 --> 04:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
it's in a flood plane but also
 
04:16:13.389 --> 04:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
disclosing any prior knowledge that you
 
04:16:17.710 --> 04:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:17.720 --> 04:16:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
occurred

04:16:19.910 --> 04:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
04:16:23.109 --> 04:16:23.119 align:start position:0%
okay that's a little trickier ain't it
 
04:16:23.119 --> 04:16:24.309 align:start position:0%
okay that's a little trickier ain't it
okay

04:16:24.309 --> 04:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:16:26.750 --> 04:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
represent yeah that was actually a
 
04:16:28.590 --> 04:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up question uh rattling around in
 
04:16:30.149 --> 04:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
my brain is how do you prove that
 
04:16:32.990 --> 04:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
someone had the knowledge uh let's say
 
04:16:35.710 --> 04:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
someone had knowledge didn't disclose it
 
04:16:37.269 --> 04:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
how do you know how could you prove that
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
they had that knowledge that's that
 
04:16:42.070 --> 04:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:44.030 --> 04:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
question what's the vi what's the
 
04:16:45.910 --> 04:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
penalties for the violation of this that
 
04:16:50.790 --> 04:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
is that is a that is a good question
 
04:16:54.870 --> 04:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
um and I quite frankly can't give you an
 
04:16:57.229 --> 04:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
answer to that off off the top of my
 
04:17:01.269 --> 04:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
head well okay representative I'm sure
 
04:17:03.550 --> 04:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
that there's there must be some kind of
 
04:17:05.790 --> 04:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
you know if it gets to a legal case
 
04:17:08.070 --> 04:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's some legal stand of you
 
04:17:11.309 --> 04:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
know uh you know what defines prior
 
04:17:13.830 --> 04:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge uh I I just I just don't know
 
04:17:17.189 --> 04:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
what that is represent bullo yeah this
 
04:17:19.950 --> 04:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
is a would you believe but I I I believe
 
04:17:21.670 --> 04:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
that um the town planners or the
 
04:17:24.750 --> 04:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
planning department would have um um
 
04:17:28.070 --> 04:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
some of this information um so you could
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
go there before you purchase a home just
 
04:17:33.550 --> 04:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
recent events um they they would
 
04:17:34.950 --> 04:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
probably have it on a map because they
 
04:17:37.790 --> 04:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
have several several Maps you know in
 
04:17:40.109 --> 04:17:40.119 align:start position:0%
maybe more cities than towns but that
 
04:17:42.070 --> 04:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
would indicate if there was flooding in
 
04:17:45.870 --> 04:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
the past y that makes
 
04:17:48.429 --> 04:17:48.439 align:start position:0%
sense representative grassy yeah Mr
 
04:17:48.439 --> 04:17:49.830 align:start position:0%
sense representative grassy yeah Mr
chairman

04:17:49.830 --> 04:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:17:52.189 --> 04:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
um would you believe that on page three
 
04:17:54.950 --> 04:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
of the amendment line 20 starts it said
 
04:17:57.070 --> 04:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
During the period of ownership they're
 
04:17:59.469 --> 04:17:59.479 align:start position:0%
responsible for that information and if
 
04:18:00.910 --> 04:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
it was before you know that's all
 
04:18:02.950 --> 04:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
they're responsible
 
04:18:05.550 --> 04:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
for yeah that that is definitely the
 
04:18:07.429 --> 04:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
intent it's only for the period that
 
04:18:09.389 --> 04:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
they owned
 
04:18:12.189 --> 04:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
it so you're from Hampton doesn't the
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
whole town flood when the creek when the
 
04:18:18.990 --> 04:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
ocean um comes not the whole town but a
 
04:18:21.030 --> 04:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
big portion of it along the uh along the
 
04:18:23.590 --> 04:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast yeah and it's uh it's mostly
 
04:18:25.870 --> 04:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
the areas that abut the marshes it's not
 
04:18:27.830 --> 04:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
the the the the area that AB buts the
 
04:18:30.109 --> 04:18:30.119 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast it's the marshes on the back
 
04:18:32.510 --> 04:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
side yeah the back side and I I actually
 
04:18:35.910 --> 04:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
have I have you know one one constituent
 
04:18:37.389 --> 04:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
that you know wanted want to be here but
 
04:18:39.750 --> 04:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
has actually submitted um online
 
04:18:43.309 --> 04:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
testimony that um talks about the fact
 
04:18:46.070 --> 04:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
that when they purchase their home they
 
04:18:48.389 --> 04:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
were not aware they were not told that
 
04:18:50.229 --> 04:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
there was any flood risk they were not
 
04:18:52.189 --> 04:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
aware of any flood risk and the home
 
04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
flood the streets around their home
 
04:18:56.670 --> 04:18:56.680 align:start position:0%
flood continually now and that's really
 
04:18:58.189 --> 04:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to get we're trying to
 
04:19:01.030 --> 04:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
address is just provide own uh
 
04:19:03.710 --> 04:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
purchasers with just you know
 
04:19:05.590 --> 04:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
information so that they can make an an
 
04:19:07.630 --> 04:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
informed decision
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
but if they had just pulled up some old
 
04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
newspapers they probably would have seen
 
04:19:16.229 --> 04:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
pictures of the of the creek Rising
 
04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
multiple times in down that street when
 
04:19:18.239 --> 04:19:19.510 align:start position:0%
multiple times in down that street when
they

04:19:19.510 --> 04:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:19:22.189 --> 04:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
have potentially if they were but you
 
04:19:24.790 --> 04:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
know I believe I you know I I don't know
 
04:19:26.510 --> 04:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
how that I don't know somebody moving in
 
04:19:28.469 --> 04:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
from out of town I don't know if that's
 
04:19:31.710 --> 04:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
is easy for them and again I mean I I
 
04:19:33.189 --> 04:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
you know there there's no question as I
 
04:19:34.910 --> 04:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
said in my testimony I mean I don't
 
04:19:36.790 --> 04:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
disagree that people should do do their
 
04:19:40.229 --> 04:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
own due diligence um but I also don't
 
04:19:42.750 --> 04:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
think that it's right and fair that all
 
04:19:44.830 --> 04:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
of that burden should fall on only on
 
04:19:46.670 --> 04:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
one of only one of the parties in the
 
04:19:49.469 --> 04:19:49.479 align:start position:0%
transaction I think if if the seller is
 
04:19:52.149 --> 04:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
aware of the seller should be able to
 
04:19:56.109 --> 04:19:56.119 align:start position:0%
tell the the perspective purchaser um
 
04:19:58.750 --> 04:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
what they know of uh the risk
 
04:20:03.469 --> 04:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
being gotcha okay yeah represent prelli
 
04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question I
 
04:20:09.189 --> 04:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
had a question about the process so I'm
 
04:20:13.429 --> 04:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
a seller and I'm not aware of any issues
 
04:20:16.670 --> 04:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
or problems so what are you a asking the
 
04:20:19.870 --> 04:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
seller to do go on a website and look
 
04:20:19.880 --> 04:20:20.790 align:start position:0%
seller to do go on a website and look
and

04:20:20.790 --> 04:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:24.630 --> 04:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
see what and then disclose what how do
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
how does the process actually
 
04:20:30.429 --> 04:20:30.439 align:start position:0%
work and you know what websites would be
 
04:20:32.870 --> 04:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
acceptable and H how does that whole
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
process work um the the the bill lays
 
04:20:39.510 --> 04:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
out starting on um in the amendment on
 
04:20:42.030 --> 04:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
line 27 on the first page and it goes
 
04:20:44.469 --> 04:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
into the second page what we're asking
 
04:20:47.630 --> 04:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
the seller to do and we're asking the
 
04:20:50.670 --> 04:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
seller to say is any or to to to answer
 
04:20:53.510 --> 04:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
yes or no is any or all of the property
 
04:20:55.109 --> 04:20:55.119 align:start position:0%
located in a federal emergency
 
04:20:57.830 --> 04:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
management agency designated flood zone
 
04:21:00.389 --> 04:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
yes or no and they can the seller can do
 
04:21:04.710 --> 04:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
that by going by going online or as I
 
04:21:07.309 --> 04:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
understand it there are um organizations
 
04:21:09.349 --> 04:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
third parties that do that work and will
 
04:21:11.830 --> 04:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
provide a letter of certif certification
 
04:21:14.229 --> 04:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
to a prospective seller so that's one
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
question the second question is is there
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
flood insurance currently on the
 
04:21:20.910 --> 04:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
property yes or no that should be a
 
04:21:23.710 --> 04:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward question um and
 
04:21:26.149 --> 04:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
then C uh the third question During the
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
period seller has owned the property has
 
04:21:29.870 --> 04:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
the property experienced any flood
 
04:21:31.670 --> 04:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
damage from flood waters entering a
 
04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
building or pooling making the property
 
04:21:35.830 --> 04:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
inaccessible due to a natural flood
 
04:21:37.750 --> 04:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
event such as heavy rainfall Coastal
 
04:21:40.590 --> 04:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
storm surge tidal inundation or riverine
 
04:21:43.590 --> 04:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
flooding yes or no um and then if yes
 
04:21:47.109 --> 04:21:47.119 align:start position:0%
has a claim been filed again the the the
 
04:21:49.189 --> 04:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
the sellers would know that if it's
 
04:21:51.870 --> 04:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
happened and then finally is there a
 
04:21:54.269 --> 04:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
FEMA elevation certificate available for
 
04:21:55.870 --> 04:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
the property yes or no and again the
 
04:21:57.630 --> 04:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
seller would have that
 
04:21:59.590 --> 04:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
information that's that's all we're
 
04:22:02.030 --> 04:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
asking quick quick uh follow further
 
04:22:05.710 --> 04:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
question follow um so what about line 25
 
04:22:05.720 --> 04:22:07.590 align:start position:0%
question follow um so what about line 25
through

04:22:07.590 --> 04:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:22:11.229 --> 04:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
31 How would how would I understand that
 
04:22:15.469 --> 04:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
information moderate flood Hazard
 
04:22:19.109 --> 04:22:19.119 align:start position:0%
area um page two y those are those are
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
the definitions of a of a flood zone and
 
04:22:24.830 --> 04:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
if you go to one of those online sites
 
04:22:27.149 --> 04:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
where you type in your ad your name or
 
04:22:29.590 --> 04:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
your your address it'll tell you which
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
level of flood zone you're in I think
 
04:22:33.269 --> 04:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
it's called so it it designates that
 
04:22:36.429 --> 04:22:36.439 align:start position:0%
it's different colors and stuff so it's
 
04:22:38.510 --> 04:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's it that that's designated on those
 
04:22:42.109 --> 04:22:42.119 align:start position:0%
sites and who that data is maintained
 
04:22:45.870 --> 04:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
by um it's FEMA is it I I think it's
 
04:22:48.710 --> 04:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
originally FEMA that maintains it but it
 
04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%

04:25:02.389 --> 04:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
we bought a property that has wetlands
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
and Wetland buffers on it uh at the time
 
04:25:08.309 --> 04:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
we didn't know that that was the case uh
 
04:25:10.149 --> 04:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
we didn't face flooding issues but the
 
04:25:12.229 --> 04:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
principles are the same between not
 
04:25:13.950 --> 04:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
knowing about wetlands and not knowing
 
04:25:16.510 --> 04:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
about flooding issues we came from an
 
04:25:18.710 --> 04:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
area out of state that was high and dry
 
04:25:21.109 --> 04:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
we didn't know what Wetlands were so we
 
04:25:23.910 --> 04:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
didn't even know what questions to ask
 
04:25:26.910 --> 04:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
um so we were relying on if there were
 
04:25:28.670 --> 04:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
issues with the property related to that
 
04:25:30.469 --> 04:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
for somebody to help us out to give us
 
04:25:32.229 --> 04:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
some guidance none was
 
04:25:35.590 --> 04:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
provided um fortunately it hasn't become
 
04:25:38.870 --> 04:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
a major issue for us um when there are
 
04:25:40.630 --> 04:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
wetlands and Wetland buffers on a
 
04:25:43.870 --> 04:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
property most communities impose certain
 
04:25:46.510 --> 04:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
conditions on how you can use Those
 
04:25:49.149 --> 04:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
portions of your property um so it does
 
04:25:50.990 --> 04:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
have an impact on your ability to use
 
04:25:52.750 --> 04:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
your property so having that information
 
04:25:52.760 --> 04:25:53.630 align:start position:0%
your property so having that information
is

04:25:53.630 --> 04:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:25:53.640 --> 04:25:55.149 align:start position:0%
is
important

04:25:55.149 --> 04:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:25:57.510 --> 04:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
um while we most likely would have made
 
04:25:59.630 --> 04:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
the same purchase decision as we made it
 
04:26:01.429 --> 04:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
would have been so much better if we had
 
04:26:03.309 --> 04:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
been better informed
 
04:26:05.790 --> 04:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
purchasers uh the sellers or their real
 
04:26:07.269 --> 04:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
estate State agents could have made it
 
04:26:08.830 --> 04:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
so but nobody
 
04:26:11.630 --> 04:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
did if you look at the 35 or so states
 
04:26:13.429 --> 04:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
that already have flood disclosure laws
 
04:26:16.109 --> 04:26:16.119 align:start position:0%
the most common disclosures are whether
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
the property has experienced past flood
 
04:26:22.269 --> 04:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
damage or has flooding problems and two
 
04:26:24.149 --> 04:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
whether the property is located in a
 
04:26:26.469 --> 04:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
FEMA designated special flood Hazard
 
04:26:30.269 --> 04:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
area or flood zone this bill is asking
 
04:26:32.349 --> 04:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
that same information to be disclosed in
 
04:26:35.309 --> 04:26:35.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and representative Ms as
 
04:26:37.349 --> 04:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
he has he discussed has worked hard to
 
04:26:39.109 --> 04:26:39.119 align:start position:0%
ensure that the sellers and landlords
 
04:26:41.109 --> 04:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
are not being asked to disclose
 
04:26:43.469 --> 04:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
information that they shouldn't already
 
04:26:46.109 --> 04:26:46.119 align:start position:0%
have and that the disclosures be done in
 
04:26:48.030 --> 04:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
such a way as to minimize if not
 
04:26:50.710 --> 04:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
eliminate any additional paperwork so
 
04:26:52.550 --> 04:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
he's trying to make it easy as possible
 
04:26:54.910 --> 04:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
to meet these disclosure
 
04:26:56.830 --> 04:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
requirements some people have said that
 
04:26:58.870 --> 04:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
the responsibility is on the buyer to do
 
04:27:01.030 --> 04:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
their due diligence and that is accurate
 
04:27:04.469 --> 04:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
and with this bill that will not change
 
04:27:06.109 --> 04:27:06.119 align:start position:0%
they have also said that potential
 
04:27:08.469 --> 04:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
purchasers or renters often double check
 
04:27:10.469 --> 04:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
information given to them by Sellers and
 
04:27:13.269 --> 04:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
landlords and that's a good thing to do
 
04:27:15.590 --> 04:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean that if the buyer
 
04:27:16.990 --> 04:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
are going to double check the
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
information anyway that those Sellers
 
04:27:21.109 --> 04:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
and landlords don't still have a
 
04:27:22.710 --> 04:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide that
 
04:27:24.349 --> 04:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
information to begin
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
with it will be because of these
 
04:27:28.790 --> 04:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
disclosures that the buyers know that
 
04:27:31.309 --> 04:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps additional questions do need to
 
04:27:33.109 --> 04:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
be asked and
 
04:27:35.469 --> 04:27:35.479 align:start position:0%
researched the point of this legislation
 
04:27:37.710 --> 04:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
is to enable buyers and renters to be as
 
04:27:40.030 --> 04:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
well informed as possible about a major
 
04:27:42.790 --> 04:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
financial decision in their lives and
 
04:27:44.870 --> 04:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
the legislation will also make some of
 
04:27:46.469 --> 04:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
that information available to them
 
04:27:48.550 --> 04:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
without creating a hardship for the
 
04:27:50.590 --> 04:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
sellers or the
 
04:27:52.790 --> 04:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
landlords people say that New Hampshire
 
04:27:55.349 --> 04:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
is a buyer beware State and I think it's
 
04:27:57.870 --> 04:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
time we update that narrative just a bit
 
04:28:00.950 --> 04:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
to have it read seller beware seller be
 
04:28:03.830 --> 04:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
fair rather buyer beware I think both
 
04:28:05.469 --> 04:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
parties have a role to play in this and
 
04:28:07.510 --> 04:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill is trying to
 
04:28:10.469 --> 04:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
accomplish thank
 
04:28:13.950 --> 04:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you all right then
 
04:28:15.870 --> 04:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
we'll get from the other side Sarah
 
04:28:27.149 --> 04:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
realators good afternoon chair thank you
 
04:28:31.229 --> 04:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
04:28:34.189 --> 04:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
Sarah Holland I am a real estate lensee
 
04:28:35.750 --> 04:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
I'm also a licensed real estate instr
 
04:28:38.149 --> 04:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
instructor from Plymouth and I am the
 
04:28:39.349 --> 04:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
vice chair of the New Hampshire
 
04:28:41.389 --> 04:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors public policy
 
04:28:43.429 --> 04:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
committee um we have had many
 
04:28:45.870 --> 04:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
conversations with representative Ms and
 
04:28:48.070 --> 04:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
we um are glad to continue those
 
04:28:51.070 --> 04:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
conversations however as it stands um
 
04:28:54.229 --> 04:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
with this amendment we are in opposition
 
04:28:57.229 --> 04:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
to HB 1320 we're certainly not in
 
04:29:00.070 --> 04:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to Consumers understanding
 
04:29:03.109 --> 04:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
the flood risks of properties we just
 
04:29:06.830 --> 04:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
feel that the language here um is
 
04:29:10.429 --> 04:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
difficult to understand um and to follow
 
04:29:13.990 --> 04:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
because it will require not just buyers
 
04:29:16.710 --> 04:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
and sellers to understand this Rule and
 
04:29:19.109 --> 04:29:19.119 align:start position:0%
regulation going forward that have
 
04:29:21.590 --> 04:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
Realtors or lenses as their
 
04:29:23.990 --> 04:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
representation but all property owners
 
04:29:25.830 --> 04:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
who wish to transfer their property
 
04:29:29.070 --> 04:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
going forward um we are definitely aware
 
04:29:30.750 --> 04:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
we work in those communities that have
 
04:29:33.109 --> 04:29:33.119 align:start position:0%
had all of the floodings in Jackson I
 
04:29:37.389 --> 04:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
live near the peny in Campton um we we
 
04:29:39.149 --> 04:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
work all over the state and we see the
 
04:29:39.159 --> 04:29:40.630 align:start position:0%
work all over the state and we see the
devastation

04:29:40.630 --> 04:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
devastation
 
04:29:43.070 --> 04:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere um what we have passing
 
04:29:45.309 --> 04:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
around is our purchase and sales
 
04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
agreement as well as our property
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
disclosure and once those get around
 
04:29:52.389 --> 04:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
I'll be able to share with you what we
 
04:30:01.750 --> 04:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:04.189 --> 04:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
Consumers copy it from represented mon
 
04:30:07.030 --> 04:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
so great we can keep going so relative
 
04:30:09.269 --> 04:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
to the purchase and sales agreement in
 
04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
section 15 so this is after someone has
 
04:30:15.670 --> 04:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
identified a property um for purchase
 
04:30:18.269 --> 04:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
there is
 
04:30:21.910 --> 04:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
um buyer satisfactory review of the
 
04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
property disclosure the property
 
04:30:27.149 --> 04:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
disclosure is our way to encourage our
 
04:30:29.830 --> 04:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
seller clients to share all information
 
04:30:31.349 --> 04:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
that they know about the property good
 
04:30:35.070 --> 04:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
or bad and the reason that we do that is
 
04:30:38.229 --> 04:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
transparent Y is super important um to
 
04:30:39.630 --> 04:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
the success of the sale of their
 
04:30:41.670 --> 04:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
property going forward the more that
 
04:30:44.229 --> 04:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
they share about the property the less
 
04:30:46.109 --> 04:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
likelihood that a transaction may fall
 
04:30:47.870 --> 04:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
apart later in the process due to
 
04:30:49.990 --> 04:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
something being
 
04:30:54.750 --> 04:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
uncovered so when we get to the purchase
 
04:30:56.870 --> 04:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
process the buyer does have to
 
04:30:58.229 --> 04:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that they've received this
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
information from the
 
04:31:02.550 --> 04:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
seller on the property disclosure which
 
04:31:04.109 --> 04:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
is the second form that I shared with
 
04:31:08.469 --> 04:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
you on page 3 section 9f the seller does
 
04:31:11.109 --> 04:31:11.119 align:start position:0%
have to disclose if they have actual
 
04:31:13.109 --> 04:31:13.119 align:start position:0%
knowledge that the property is in a
 
04:31:16.990 --> 04:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
federally designated flood Hazard Zone
 
04:31:23.149 --> 04:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
in addition in section um 9 L on page
 
04:31:27.550 --> 04:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
4 they do have to the seller does have
 
04:31:27.560 --> 04:31:28.670 align:start position:0%
4 they do have to the seller does have
to

04:31:28.670 --> 04:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:31:31.790 --> 04:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
share whether there has been a flooding
 
04:31:35.750 --> 04:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
or a leaking event relative to the the
 
04:31:39.870 --> 04:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:42.630 --> 04:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
property although we can only encourage
 
04:31:46.149 --> 04:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
our sellers to be truthful we know that
 
04:31:49.070 --> 04:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
not everyone may be truthful and we know
 
04:31:51.830 --> 04:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is a buyer beware
 
04:31:55.109 --> 04:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
State I work both with Sellers and with
 
04:31:58.870 --> 04:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
Buyers on the buying side the Mantra is
 
04:32:01.309 --> 04:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
trust but verify we're going to look
 
04:32:03.950 --> 04:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
into that property as much as possible
 
04:32:06.309 --> 04:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
stepping foot on a property can share a
 
04:32:08.670 --> 04:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
lot of information right if you're near
 
04:32:11.189 --> 04:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
a body of water that may flood if you
 
04:32:13.830 --> 04:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
see a flood event or you see some
 
04:32:17.030 --> 04:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
crystallization in the basement you can
 
04:32:18.670 --> 04:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
pick up on some clues that there may
 
04:32:20.189 --> 04:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
have been a flooding event that we need
 
04:32:23.710 --> 04:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
to look forward look at going forward um
 
04:32:27.550 --> 04:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
we also have access to mapping systems
 
04:32:30.070 --> 04:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
um that Dees puts forward that the state
 
04:32:31.550 --> 04:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire puts forward that our
 
04:32:35.550 --> 04:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
communities and um FEMA puts forward so
 
04:32:36.990 --> 04:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
that information is part of our due
 
04:32:38.790 --> 04:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
diligence both on the selling side and
 
04:32:40.229 --> 04:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
on the buying side because of course
 
04:32:42.469 --> 04:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
there's a liability piece for everyone
 
04:32:44.590 --> 04:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
involved in a transaction if this
 
04:32:50.510 --> 04:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:53.830 --> 04:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
disclosed the other piece is that the
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
language of this buyers are provided
 
04:32:58.830 --> 04:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
with so much information in the sales
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
process that their eyes cross they are
 
04:33:05.990 --> 04:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
unaware and as was testified earlier um
 
04:33:07.310 --> 04:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes they just don't know the
 
04:33:09.750 --> 04:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
questions that they need to ask um which
 
04:33:11.789 --> 04:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
is why when we partner with them we do a
 
04:33:14.590 --> 04:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
lot of one-on-one verbal um education
 
04:33:17.070 --> 04:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
with them to talk with them on site at a
 
04:33:19.629 --> 04:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
property talking about the pros and cons
 
04:33:21.789 --> 04:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
things we need to look into um and
 
04:33:23.349 --> 04:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
considerations that they need to make
 
04:33:24.789 --> 04:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
whether they're moving forward when
 
04:33:26.189 --> 04:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
deciding to move forward with a
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
particular property adding more language
 
04:33:31.109 --> 04:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
in front of them that is confusing when
 
04:33:33.189 --> 04:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
I read it as a real estate practitioner
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
having some knowledge in this area I
 
04:33:38.670 --> 04:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
find it confusing um so I think we need
 
04:33:41.789 --> 04:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
to think about that going
 
04:33:47.070 --> 04:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
forward I am happy to answer any
 
04:33:49.551 --> 04:33:49.561 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
04:33:52.590 --> 04:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
buo thank you for taking my question do
 
04:33:55.709 --> 04:33:55.719 align:start position:0%
all Realtors present this yes and they
 
04:33:57.551 --> 04:33:57.561 align:start position:0%
have to fill it out with the property
 
04:34:00.830 --> 04:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
owner yes yes and every property owner
 
04:34:03.150 --> 04:34:03.160 align:start position:0%
um will fill it out to different degrees
 
04:34:04.629 --> 04:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
varying degrees depending on their
 
04:34:06.070 --> 04:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the prop property
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
everything from if it's a foreclosure
 
04:34:09.990 --> 04:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
and it's being held by an asset manager
 
04:34:11.470 --> 04:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
no knowledge of what's happening on the
 
04:34:13.990 --> 04:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
property some property owners are very
 
04:34:16.109 --> 04:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
very thorough and will complete they
 
04:34:18.150 --> 04:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
have great history they're great record
 
04:34:20.269 --> 04:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
Keepers but most folks fall somewhere in
 
04:34:20.279 --> 04:34:22.510 align:start position:0%
Keepers but most folks fall somewhere in
the

04:34:22.510 --> 04:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:25.910 --> 04:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
middle any other
 
04:34:29.230 --> 04:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you thank you
 
04:34:32.590 --> 04:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:46.670 --> 04:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:49.551 --> 04:34:49.561 align:start position:0%
there we go good afternoon my name is
 
04:34:52.910 --> 04:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth dery I am a Derm resident and
 
04:34:55.269 --> 04:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
a professional planning consultant I'm
 
04:34:59.029 --> 04:34:59.039 align:start position:0%
testifying today in favor of HP 1320 on
 
04:35:01.109 --> 04:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Hampton Coastal hazards
 
04:35:03.830 --> 04:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
adaptation team or chat which Mr deer
 
04:35:06.269 --> 04:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
spoke to earlier I've served as the
 
04:35:09.830 --> 04:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
coordinator for chat since
 
04:35:12.869 --> 04:35:12.879 align:start position:0%
2019 um Jay commented on how chat had
 
04:35:16.070 --> 04:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
come up with uh 19 recommendations um
 
04:35:18.029 --> 04:35:18.039 align:start position:0%
many of which the town is taking action
 
04:35:20.510 --> 04:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
on now or has incorporated into its
 
04:35:22.869 --> 04:35:22.879 align:start position:0%
Municipal master plan one of the
 
04:35:25.230 --> 04:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations requires State action
 
04:35:27.789 --> 04:35:27.799 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're here today to talk
 
04:35:30.109 --> 04:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
about I have
 
04:35:32.670 --> 04:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
um a couple key points today that I want
 
04:35:34.429 --> 04:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
to talk about and one suggested
 
04:35:36.150 --> 04:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
amendment that I will follow up within
 
04:35:38.830 --> 04:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
writing to keep my comments as breed as
 
04:35:41.629 --> 04:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
possible the first is that there are a
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
lot of vulnerable properties millions of
 
04:35:45.949 --> 04:35:45.959 align:start position:0%
people in the US live in homes that are
 
04:35:47.670 --> 04:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
at risk of flooding and their homes will
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
likely get flooded again while the Sea
 
04:35:52.629 --> 04:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
Coast faces additional Coastal
 
04:35:55.070 --> 04:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities flood hazards exist
 
04:35:56.910 --> 04:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
throughout our state within flood paines
 
04:35:59.310 --> 04:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
and areas that are impacted by storm
 
04:36:01.629 --> 04:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
water and high groundwater there are
 
04:36:01.639 --> 04:36:02.910 align:start position:0%
water and high groundwater there are
currently

04:36:02.910 --> 04:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:36:05.349 --> 04:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
7,261 National flood insurance polic
 
04:36:07.470 --> 04:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
holders in New Hampshire and many more
 
04:36:09.349 --> 04:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
uninsured properties located within
 
04:36:12.629 --> 04:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
flood planes and other at risk areas as
 
04:36:14.510 --> 04:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
we know from the New Hampshire climate
 
04:36:17.150 --> 04:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
assessment flood vulnerability will
 
04:36:19.390 --> 04:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
increase precipitation has increased
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
during the last century with the highest
 
04:36:23.470 --> 04:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
number of extreme precipitation events
 
04:36:25.670 --> 04:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
occurring in the last decade mean
 
04:36:27.990 --> 04:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
precipitation and precipitation extremes
 
04:36:30.390 --> 04:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
are projected to increase in the future
 
04:36:33.269 --> 04:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
with Associated increases in flooding
 
04:36:35.390 --> 04:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
rising sea levels POS significant ific
 
04:36:36.990 --> 04:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
risks to Coastal communities and
 
04:36:39.750 --> 04:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
structures such such as inundation land
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
loss due to erosion and greater flood
 
04:36:45.230 --> 04:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
vulnerability due to higher storm surch
 
04:36:46.629 --> 04:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
my second point is that flood
 
04:36:49.390 --> 04:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
vulnerability is not always obvious even
 
04:36:51.670 --> 04:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
if a prospective buyer or renter knows
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
about flood planes it can be very
 
04:36:55.510 --> 04:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
difficult and Navigate to navigate and
 
04:36:56.949 --> 04:36:56.959 align:start position:0%
interpret flood
 
04:36:59.869 --> 04:36:59.879 align:start position:0%
maps if you live in a 100-year flood
 
04:37:01.949 --> 04:37:01.959 align:start position:0%
plane and have a mortgage you're
 
04:37:03.789 --> 04:37:03.799 align:start position:0%
required to have flood insurance so
 
04:37:05.869 --> 04:37:05.879 align:start position:0%
that's easy information to
 
04:37:08.789 --> 04:37:08.799 align:start position:0%
access without a requirement to disclose
 
04:37:11.109 --> 04:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
past damages to potential buyers it's
 
04:37:13.070 --> 04:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult for a home buyer or
 
04:37:15.869 --> 04:37:15.879 align:start position:0%
renter to learn about a property's flood
 
04:37:18.429 --> 04:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
history identifying flood risk in
 
04:37:20.230 --> 04:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
locations outside of a mapped flood
 
04:37:22.750 --> 04:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
plane requires site specific knowledge
 
04:37:24.789 --> 04:37:24.799 align:start position:0%
which prospective buyers and renters may
 
04:37:28.670 --> 04:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:31.910 --> 04:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
to one report found that homeowners who
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
unwittingly purchase a flood prone home
 
04:37:35.629 --> 04:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
are likely to encourage tens of
 
04:37:37.949 --> 04:37:37.959 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars in flood related
 
04:37:40.470 --> 04:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
damages I can personally attest to the
 
04:37:43.070 --> 04:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
financial and stress inducing impacts of
 
04:37:44.470 --> 04:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
finding out that your new home is
 
04:37:47.070 --> 04:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to flooding my house is not
 
04:37:49.269 --> 04:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
located near a river lake Wetland or
 
04:37:51.310 --> 04:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
flood plane but it's vulnerable to
 
04:37:53.949 --> 04:37:53.959 align:start position:0%
flooding when it rains hard gutting and
 
04:37:55.551 --> 04:37:55.561 align:start position:0%
renovating our basement accessory
 
04:37:57.551 --> 04:37:57.561 align:start position:0%
apartment to mitigate water damage from
 
04:37:59.390 --> 04:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
past flooding we weren't aware of has
 
04:38:02.029 --> 04:38:02.039 align:start position:0%
cost thousands of dollars and until we
 
04:38:04.510 --> 04:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
identify and pay for a solution we rely
 
04:38:07.029 --> 04:38:07.039 align:start position:0%
on quick dams and shoveling water from
 
04:38:08.709 --> 04:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
to prevent water from entering our
 
04:38:11.070 --> 04:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
apartment door our tenant is not happy
 
04:38:12.949 --> 04:38:12.959 align:start position:0%
with this but as you know the situation
 
04:38:14.750 --> 04:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is very difficult to
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
find rental apartments so he's tolerated
 
04:38:21.990 --> 04:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
it by denying home buyers information
 
04:38:23.789 --> 04:38:23.799 align:start position:0%
about past flooding people can't make
 
04:38:25.390 --> 04:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
informed decisions about one of their
 
04:38:28.349 --> 04:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
biggest financial investments their home
 
04:38:30.949 --> 04:38:30.959 align:start position:0%
my third point is that the coastal
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
hazards adaptation team is not alone in
 
04:38:35.750 --> 04:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
identifying flood risk closure as an
 
04:38:38.590 --> 04:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
important strategy to reduce risk the
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
natural resources defense Council
 
04:38:42.551 --> 04:38:42.561 align:start position:0%
recommends that states update their
 
04:38:44.670 --> 04:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
inadequate disclosure laws to provide
 
04:38:46.629 --> 04:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
home buyers with the right to know
 
04:38:48.750 --> 04:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
whether a home has ever flooded how
 
04:38:51.390 --> 04:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
often what it cost to make repairs if
 
04:38:53.189 --> 04:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
the home is located within a designated
 
04:38:55.470 --> 04:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
flood plane and if flood insurance is
 
04:38:57.590 --> 04:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
required on the property representative
 
04:38:59.390 --> 04:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
months has not gone as far as including
 
04:39:03.189 --> 04:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
all those items in in his proposed
 
04:39:05.949 --> 04:39:05.959 align:start position:0%
bill um and that that's an an effort to
 
04:39:07.590 --> 04:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
make this
 
04:39:11.629 --> 04:39:11.639 align:start position:0%
um uh better supported to uh the
 
04:39:15.390 --> 04:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
realtors in 2019 a poll by the
 
04:39:18.310 --> 04:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
charitable trust found that 74% of
 
04:39:20.230 --> 04:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
Americans support a requirement that
 
04:39:22.670 --> 04:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
home sellers inform potential buyers if
 
04:39:26.189 --> 04:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
a PL property has flooded repeatedly and
 
04:39:28.349 --> 04:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
the Federal Emergency Management agency
 
04:39:30.070 --> 04:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
which administers the national flood
 
04:39:32.750 --> 04:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
insurance program has provided guidance
 
04:39:36.750 --> 04:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
on disclosure policies as of its 2022
 
04:39:39.590 --> 04:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
publication female reports that 35
 
04:39:41.868 --> 04:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
states have en enacted some form of
 
04:39:44.430 --> 04:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
legal or regulatory mechanism requiring
 
04:39:46.948 --> 04:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
property sellers to disclose factors
 
04:39:48.430 --> 04:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
related to flood risk about their
 
04:39:50.990 --> 04:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
property fima reports that knowing the
 
04:39:52.510 --> 04:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
risk of flooding is the first step
 
04:39:54.708 --> 04:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
towards adequately protecting lives and
 
04:39:56.670 --> 04:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
property and that knowledge can help
 
04:39:59.510 --> 04:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
individuals families and communities
 
04:40:01.868 --> 04:40:01.878 align:start position:0%
FEMA recommends that states take action
 
04:40:04.230 --> 04:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
to protect home buyers in their state by
 
04:40:06.430 --> 04:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
enacting laws and implementing practices
 
04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
that require disclosure of flood risk it
 
04:40:11.230 --> 04:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
notes that states with flood with flood
 
04:40:13.390 --> 04:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirements often have
 
04:40:14.948 --> 04:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
higher rates of residential flood
 
04:40:17.110 --> 04:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
insurance uptake which enables
 
04:40:18.990 --> 04:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
communities to recover more quickly
 
04:40:19.000 --> 04:40:20.310 align:start position:0%
communities to recover more quickly
after

04:40:20.310 --> 04:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
after
 
04:40:22.750 --> 04:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
floods the report includes a summary of
 
04:40:25.550 --> 04:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
items commonly found in disclosure laws
 
04:40:27.990 --> 04:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
and or legally man mandated disclosure
 
04:40:29.868 --> 04:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
forms which I won't read today unless
 
04:40:32.470 --> 04:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
you'd like me to but I will provide in
 
04:40:34.470 --> 04:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
writing um many of these items are
 
04:40:37.230 --> 04:40:37.240 align:start position:0%
covered covered in HB
 
04:40:39.350 --> 04:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
1320 I will follow up with my
 
04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
recommended Amendment um in writing and
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
inclosing I would like to say that a
 
04:40:46.390 --> 04:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
flood risk disclosure policy is an
 
04:40:48.030 --> 04:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
important component of a more resilient
 
04:40:50.670 --> 04:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire among property owners and
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
buyers or renters property owners are
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
the more knowledgeable party with
 
04:40:56.070 --> 04:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
respect to past flood events and
 
04:40:58.510 --> 04:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
awareness of whether a home has flood
 
04:41:01.990 --> 04:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
insurance um therefore um I believe home
 
04:41:03.670 --> 04:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
property owner should be responsible for
 
04:41:05.550 --> 04:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
sharing this information
 
04:41:06.868 --> 04:41:06.878 align:start position:0%

don't often speak before this committee
 
04:41:58.788 --> 04:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
I'm often before Judiciary um but we
 
04:42:01.070 --> 04:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
have a network of
 
04:42:04.150 --> 04:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
3500 uh readers that we are property
 
04:42:06.310 --> 04:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
owners landlords throughout the state
 
04:42:08.270 --> 04:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
that we are in constant communication

with through our legislative updates and
 
04:42:11.430 --> 04:42:11.440 align:start position:0%

laws uh I myself have been a property

owner since about 1991 as a landlord I
 
04:42:22.550 --> 04:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
have 48 units so I'm I'm pretty
 
04:42:25.350 --> 04:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
experienced as a landlord in
 
04:42:27.510 --> 04:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
this in New
 
04:42:31.350 --> 04:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um representative Ms uh
 
04:42:35.510 --> 04:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
contacted us to get uh our thoughts on
 
04:42:37.470 --> 04:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
the bill and I thank him very much for
 
04:42:40.670 --> 04:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
that that was very good and very helpful
 
04:42:43.350 --> 04:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
we had a good meeting uh together with
 
04:42:45.390 --> 04:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
the Association of
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
Realtors I do have some written
 
04:42:50.030 --> 04:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
testimony I don't have 21 or whatever
 
04:42:51.750 --> 04:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
copies I would need but I do have an
 
04:42:53.270 --> 04:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
extra one that I can pass out to the
 
04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
committee and I will email it to the
 
04:42:59.430 --> 04:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
committee so you'll have it so you can
 
04:43:01.430 --> 04:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
relax a little bit on intense note
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
ticking because I'll I'll email it to
 
04:43:06.670 --> 04:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
you there's many many many concerns with
 
04:43:06.680 --> 04:43:07.350 align:start position:0%
you there's many many many concerns with
the

04:43:07.350 --> 04:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:43:10.510 --> 04:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
bill um particularly in like Devil in
 
04:43:12.190 --> 04:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
the details kind
 
04:43:15.628 --> 04:43:15.638 align:start position:0%
of situations so we oppose the bill
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
certainly as
 
04:43:20.470 --> 04:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
written so I'm just going to go through
 
04:43:22.470 --> 04:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
several I can't take up your whole
 
04:43:24.430 --> 04:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon but I'll try to highlight some
 
04:43:27.390 --> 04:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
of the ones that seem to be real
 
04:43:30.390 --> 04:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
important first off all of this language
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:37.948 --> 04:43:37.958 align:start position:0%
477 real estate as it applies to
 
04:43:42.070 --> 04:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
landlords and tenants is in RSA
 
04:43:45.150 --> 04:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
540 so I think it's a huge mistake to
 
04:43:49.030 --> 04:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
put this in a different statute than
 
04:43:52.510 --> 04:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
what landlord tenant law is normally in
 
04:43:55.150 --> 04:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
so anyone trying to figure out what's
 
04:43:56.750 --> 04:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities of the landlords
 
04:43:58.030 --> 04:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
and tenants they're going to be looking
 
04:44:01.110 --> 04:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
in 540 and they're going to miss
 
04:44:05.030 --> 04:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
this the other thing is that if you look
 
04:44:07.030 --> 04:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
at the header of the
 
04:44:07.040 --> 04:44:09.350 align:start position:0%
at the header of the
bill

04:44:09.350 --> 04:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:44:13.310 --> 04:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
on uh first line it says new section
 
04:44:15.590 --> 04:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
notification of flood risk prior to sale
 
04:44:18.070 --> 04:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
of real property it doesn't mention
 
04:44:20.948 --> 04:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant it doesn't mention
 
04:44:22.948 --> 04:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
rentals but it's thoroughly about
 
04:44:25.550 --> 04:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
landlords and tenants so it' be really
 
04:44:29.110 --> 04:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
easy to miss this if you were like
 
04:44:30.948 --> 04:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
researching finding out what your
 
04:44:33.350 --> 04:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
requirements are as a landlord or a
 
04:44:35.868 --> 04:44:35.878 align:start position:0%
tenant we think that having the
 
04:44:38.510 --> 04:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
government provide an easily available
 
04:44:41.910 --> 04:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
website is a great idea that's mentioned
 
04:44:44.510 --> 04:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill I think it should be easy
 
04:44:46.830 --> 04:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
for someone to look up information both
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
landlords and
 
04:44:50.670 --> 04:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
tenants we would Advocate that the
 
04:44:54.070 --> 04:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
tenant are adults they can do their own
 
04:44:56.270 --> 04:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
due diligence they can do their research
 
04:44:57.990 --> 04:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony several times
 
04:45:00.030 --> 04:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
already that it's readily available
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
online you can just go get
 
04:45:03.280 --> 04:45:05.270 align:start position:0%
online you can just go get
it

04:45:05.270 --> 04:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:45:07.350 --> 04:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement in here of both
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
100e and
 
04:45:12.788 --> 04:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
500e notifications anything in a
 
04:45:16.390 --> 04:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
500e flood zone would have to be
 
04:45:19.628 --> 04:45:19.638 align:start position:0%
disclosed and information given it seems
 
04:45:22.750 --> 04:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:25.948 --> 04:45:25.958 align:start position:0%
Overkill there's an odd thing in the
 
04:45:28.990 --> 04:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
languaging the bill would encourage
 
04:45:31.708 --> 04:45:31.718 align:start position:0%
landlords to not have an application and
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
not have a
 
04:45:33.280 --> 04:45:34.868 align:start position:0%
not have a
lease

04:45:34.868 --> 04:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
lease
 
04:45:37.030 --> 04:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
the way this is drafted the disclosure
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
requirement comes into play when you
 
04:45:41.550 --> 04:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
have an application and when you have a
 
04:45:44.868 --> 04:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
lease a lot of landlords don't have a
 
04:45:47.868 --> 04:45:47.878 align:start position:0%
lease uh some people really don't do
 
04:45:49.830 --> 04:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
applications you know they go by their
 
04:45:55.390 --> 04:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:57.868 --> 04:45:57.878 align:start position:0%
someone uh there's a concern that this
 
04:46:00.868 --> 04:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
could affect liability uh for the
 
04:46:04.670 --> 04:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
property owners if they're held Li for
 
04:46:07.310 --> 04:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
disclosing something they may not know
 
04:46:09.310 --> 04:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
and what does that do to insurance rates
 
04:46:09.320 --> 04:46:12.708 align:start position:0%
and what does that do to insurance rates
Insurance

04:46:12.708 --> 04:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:15.430 --> 04:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
risks I can't guarantee you that I will
 
04:46:17.350 --> 04:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
remember that there was a flood in a
 
04:46:20.750 --> 04:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
property 35 years ago or 50 years ago
 
04:46:22.750 --> 04:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
some property owners own property for a
 
04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
long time so to to make something now as
 
04:46:28.990 --> 04:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
a requirement to remember something that
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
happened 50 years ago I think is is
 
04:46:33.200 --> 04:46:37.628 align:start position:0%
happened 50 years ago I think is is
unreasonable

04:46:37.628 --> 04:46:37.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:39.390 --> 04:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
so there's some really Troublesome
 
04:46:40.948 --> 04:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
language the way it's
 
04:46:44.070 --> 04:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
written and section Roman I can't tell
 
04:46:45.868 --> 04:46:45.878 align:start position:0%
you the page and line number but I can
 
04:46:48.350 --> 04:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
tell you it's Roman 2 section g there's
 
04:46:50.350 --> 04:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
a language that says results in damage
 
04:46:52.430 --> 04:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
to a tenant's personal
 
04:46:54.548 --> 04:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
property and there's also language that
 
04:46:56.590 --> 04:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
says tenant shall only be liable to pay
 
04:46:58.350 --> 04:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
for rent through the effective date of
 
04:47:00.430 --> 04:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
the lease's
 
04:47:04.150 --> 04:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
termination so if there's the tiniest
 
04:47:08.548 --> 04:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
spe of flood damage then the tenant
 
04:47:10.670 --> 04:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
would by this language be released from
 
04:47:10.680 --> 04:47:11.948 align:start position:0%
would by this language be released from
all

04:47:11.948 --> 04:47:11.958 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:47:15.470 --> 04:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
liability if the tenant doesn't move by
 
04:47:16.470 --> 04:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
the lease
 
04:47:19.390 --> 04:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
termination then they're living in the
 
04:47:21.350 --> 04:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
property with
 
04:47:23.590 --> 04:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
statutory uh language that says they
 
04:47:25.470 --> 04:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay rent they don't have
 
04:47:27.390 --> 04:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
to pay any lawful damages they don't
 
04:47:29.788 --> 04:47:29.798 align:start position:0%
have to pay the utilities can I just ask
 
04:47:31.628 --> 04:47:31.638 align:start position:0%
you a question just not to interrupt you
 
04:47:33.788 --> 04:47:33.798 align:start position:0%
you're speaking about the original Bill
 
04:47:36.030 --> 04:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm speaking about the original Bill
 
04:47:38.270 --> 04:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for that Clarity so and we
 
04:47:39.670 --> 04:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
have the amendment in front of us but
 
04:47:41.510 --> 04:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
maybe you have not seen the amendment I
 
04:47:43.230 --> 04:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
haven't I have been given a copy but I
 
04:47:44.670 --> 04:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
haven't had time to review it okay thank
 
04:47:46.230 --> 04:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
you I I will review
 
04:47:51.070 --> 04:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
it um based on what representative Ms
 
04:47:52.708 --> 04:47:52.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned I doubt that any of the
 
04:47:54.708 --> 04:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
changes I'm talking about are have been
 
04:47:57.070 --> 04:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
changed on the
 
04:48:02.030 --> 04:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
amendment so um you know that's totally
 
04:48:04.350 --> 04:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
unworkable here you have a situation
 
04:48:06.948 --> 04:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
where by law the tenant could stay and
 
04:48:09.110 --> 04:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
now not be required to pay rent not be
 
04:48:10.868 --> 04:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
required to pay any utilities or any
 
04:48:12.868 --> 04:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
other lawful damages so there's no means
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:21.628 --> 04:48:21.638 align:start position:0%
them this is in the original
 
04:48:23.948 --> 04:48:23.958 align:start position:0%
bill I haven't had a chance to review
 
04:48:27.548 --> 04:48:27.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:30.310 --> 04:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
yet what page are you looking at what
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
page are you looking at let me see if I
 
04:48:37.948 --> 04:48:37.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:40.510 --> 04:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
well so I think it's it's fair that he
 
04:48:42.590 --> 04:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
gives his comments because he didn't
 
04:48:44.230 --> 04:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
have advanced notice of the amendment
 
04:48:46.590 --> 04:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
right so he he's doing what he came
 
04:48:48.670 --> 04:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
prepared to do and U that's a last
 
04:48:51.510 --> 04:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
minute thing right and and I can in
 
04:48:53.430 --> 04:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
email I can clarify that by looking at
 
04:48:53.440 --> 04:48:54.110 align:start position:0%
email I can clarify that by looking at
the

04:48:54.110 --> 04:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:48:56.548 --> 04:48:56.558 align:start position:0%
amendment um based on what I heard I
 
04:48:58.948 --> 04:48:58.958 align:start position:0%
don't see any evidence that these things
 
04:49:01.350 --> 04:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about have changed but I'll
 
04:49:02.788 --> 04:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
let you
 
04:49:07.750 --> 04:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
know um um let's see section Roman 3H
 
04:49:10.628 --> 04:49:10.638 align:start position:0%
which immediately follows
 
04:49:14.590 --> 04:49:14.600 align:start position:0%
that says that tenant would be refunded
 
04:49:16.270 --> 04:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
any amounts paid in
 
04:49:18.510 --> 04:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
advance well it's not clarified what
 
04:49:20.310 --> 04:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
does that mean does that mean
 
04:49:23.190 --> 04:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
application fees does that mean utility
 
04:49:25.750 --> 04:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
fees paid in advance that were prepaid
 
04:49:28.590 --> 04:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:31.628 --> 04:49:31.638 align:start position:0%
used a lot of lot of concerns with with
 
04:49:34.510 --> 04:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
the way that's written the way it was
 
04:49:36.628 --> 04:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
originally written is that the housing
 
04:49:38.628 --> 04:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
PR provider would be required to give
 
04:49:40.430 --> 04:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
money back to the tenant and the Tenant
 
04:49:43.948 --> 04:49:43.958 align:start position:0%
no longer required to pay rent with no
 
04:49:46.830 --> 04:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
recourse uh there's a very large amount
 
04:49:49.390 --> 04:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
of concerns with this the way that it's
 
04:49:52.230 --> 04:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
written and I'll I'll get that email to
 
04:49:53.750 --> 04:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
you with all of these points and there's
 
04:49:55.270 --> 04:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
more in there I just don't want to take
 
04:49:57.868 --> 04:49:57.878 align:start position:0%
an enormous amount of time and testimony
 
04:50:00.310 --> 04:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
when I'll give it to you in writing I'd
 
04:50:02.548 --> 04:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
be very happy to answer any questions
 
04:50:08.030 --> 04:50:08.040 align:start position:0%

the bill okay I'm sorry you're sitting
over

04:50:37.990 --> 04:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:50:44.070 --> 04:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:47.070 --> 04:50:47.080 align:start position:0%
yeah um I'm I'm not going to I'm not
 
04:50:50.150 --> 04:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
going to take away from any of the the
 
04:50:53.190 --> 04:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
many of the concerns that um Mr Norman
 
04:50:55.750 --> 04:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
expressed um I did want to clarify one
 
04:50:58.510 --> 04:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
thing though that um I had referred to
 
04:50:59.708 --> 04:50:59.718 align:start position:0%
the fact mentioned to the fact that
 
04:51:01.310 --> 04:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
there were drafting errors with the
 
04:51:03.470 --> 04:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
original Bill and one of the drafting
 
04:51:06.350 --> 04:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
errors was that it did include as Mr
 
04:51:08.070 --> 04:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
Norman said it did
 
04:51:11.548 --> 04:51:11.558 align:start position:0%
include um rental addressing rental
 
04:51:16.548 --> 04:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
property in the same RSA as um purchas
 
04:51:19.948 --> 04:51:19.958 align:start position:0%
uh U sale property and that's one of the
 
04:51:21.868 --> 04:51:21.878 align:start position:0%
changes that I made in the amendment and
 
04:51:23.868 --> 04:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
you'll see that in the amendment
 
04:51:26.150 --> 04:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
everything related to this the purchase
 
04:51:29.070 --> 04:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
and sale of property is an RSA
 
04:51:32.190 --> 04:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
477 and the language pertaining to
 
04:51:35.910 --> 04:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
rental property is an RSA say 540 um and
 
04:51:39.310 --> 04:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
I think that most of the other language
 
04:51:42.110 --> 04:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
that related to to rental property and
 
04:51:44.030 --> 04:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
the original bill was transferred into
 
04:51:49.030 --> 04:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
that new RSA but um uh that would still
 
04:51:51.270 --> 04:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh lead to some of the concerns that Mr
 
04:51:52.948 --> 04:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
Norman had so I just wanted to clarify
 
04:51:54.430 --> 04:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
that one point so we'll give the
 
04:51:56.230 --> 04:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
disclaimer that all bills in Commerce go
 
04:51:58.230 --> 04:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
to subcommittee and we we can have
 
04:52:00.910 --> 04:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
continued discussion then thank you yeah
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
all right uh so we'll
 
04:52:06.548 --> 04:52:06.558 align:start position:0%
call let's see here uh so we have two
 
04:52:10.110 --> 04:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
cards remaining uh Mark K
 
04:52:10.120 --> 04:52:12.150 align:start position:0%
cards remaining uh Mark K
cond

04:52:12.150 --> 04:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
cond
 
04:52:15.470 --> 04:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
condro I apologize for that and you're
 
04:52:16.868 --> 04:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
representing yourself you ask for two
 
04:52:21.110 --> 04:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:23.990 --> 04:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you so much U Mark condo
 
04:52:28.548 --> 04:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
demat traki um I do uh I do support the
 
04:52:30.708 --> 04:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
bill um just briefly don't need a lot of
 
04:52:32.910 --> 04:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
time A lot's been said um just want to
 
04:52:33.910 --> 04:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
give you a quick background found out
 
04:52:35.788 --> 04:52:35.798 align:start position:0%
who I am I'm a licensed professional
 
04:52:37.390 --> 04:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
engineer I'm also a licensed
 
04:52:39.548 --> 04:52:39.558 align:start position:0%
professional surveyor uh I'm also a
 
04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
licensed Insurance producer I've been
 
04:52:43.708 --> 04:52:43.718 align:start position:0%
designated by The National Society of
 
04:52:46.030 --> 04:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
professional surveyors as a certified
 
04:52:48.548 --> 04:52:48.558 align:start position:0%
flood plane surveyor and I've also been
 
04:52:51.230 --> 04:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
designated as a subject matter expert um
 
04:52:53.548 --> 04:52:53.558 align:start position:0%
by FEMA to address the technical mapping
 
04:52:56.310 --> 04:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
advisory committee on um directing uh
 
04:52:59.390 --> 04:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
flood plane mapping and updating the um
 
04:53:02.470 --> 04:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
the FEMA mapping uh coordination system
 
04:53:05.708 --> 04:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
so I I just want to briefly touch base
 
04:53:08.548 --> 04:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
on a couple of comments that were made
 
04:53:10.830 --> 04:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
um we have to keep in mind that that
 
04:53:12.628 --> 04:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
flooding is the most common natural
 
04:53:14.788 --> 04:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
disaster to occur on a regular basis in
 
04:53:17.628 --> 04:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
the United States and over 140 people
 
04:53:20.990 --> 04:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
are killed annually from flooding and
 
04:53:23.110 --> 04:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
you know in 2021 2022 there was flash
 
04:53:24.948 --> 04:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
flooding in New York City and there were
 
04:53:27.628 --> 04:53:27.638 align:start position:0%
people literally drowning in their
 
04:53:29.390 --> 04:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
Apartments uh because they couldn't get
 
04:53:31.070 --> 04:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
out the hydrostatic pressure of the
 
04:53:33.070 --> 04:53:33.080 align:start position:0%
water would not allow them to open the
 
04:53:35.670 --> 04:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
doors to their apartments and they
 
04:53:38.670 --> 04:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
literally expired as a result of that
 
04:53:41.750 --> 04:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
and we have to keep in mind that a flood
 
04:53:45.110 --> 04:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
is an event it it is a catastrophic
 
04:53:47.750 --> 04:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
event in most cases to most people
 
04:53:49.150 --> 04:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to have annual flooding you
 
04:53:51.750 --> 04:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
know in Sea Coast areas um in the Keen
 
04:53:55.510 --> 04:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
area low-lying areas riverine areas um
 
04:53:57.590 --> 04:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
but for the majority of flooding that
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
occurs it is going to be a catastrophic
 
04:54:03.990 --> 04:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
event and trust me you will remember
 
04:54:06.030 --> 04:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
that event when it occurs you will
 
04:54:08.590 --> 04:54:08.600 align:start position:0%
remember when it happens um because
 
04:54:10.470 --> 04:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
there will be substantial damage there
 
04:54:13.470 --> 04:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
will be significant inconvenience um and
 
04:54:15.470 --> 04:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
all along all that goes along with
 
04:54:19.190 --> 04:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
it uh I also have a realtor training
 
04:54:21.548 --> 04:54:21.558 align:start position:0%
course where I have a two-hour
 
04:54:24.150 --> 04:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
continuing education course where I go
 
04:54:26.470 --> 04:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
and train Realtors about flood plane
 
04:54:28.628 --> 04:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
flood plane management um surveying and
 
04:54:31.910 --> 04:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
Engineering as it pertains to flooding
 
04:54:34.230 --> 04:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
and the transfer of property
 
04:54:35.948 --> 04:54:35.958 align:start position:0%
and what the vast majority of real
 
04:54:38.990 --> 04:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
Realtors tell me is they are not
 
04:54:42.110 --> 04:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
interested in engaging on the disclosure
 
04:54:44.350 --> 04:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
with whether or not a property is or
 
04:54:46.590 --> 04:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
isn't in a flood plane and they simply
 
04:54:48.390 --> 04:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
check off
 
04:54:51.990 --> 04:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
unknown um and you know I honestly I
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
can't blame
 
04:54:56.948 --> 04:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
them because again you're asking a
 
04:55:00.910 --> 04:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
realtor to now delve into a very very
 
04:55:05.830 --> 04:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
complicated subject and and provide some
 
04:55:08.470 --> 04:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
specific Direction on a subject that
 
04:55:12.548 --> 04:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
they may not be completely uh you
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
know educated in and that's another
 
04:55:18.510 --> 04:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
reason why I provide this training um I
 
04:55:20.670 --> 04:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
do want to dispel a couple of myths
 
04:55:22.470 --> 04:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
though about how easy this information
 
04:55:25.868 --> 04:55:25.878 align:start position:0%
is to obtain um it is straightforward
 
04:55:28.310 --> 04:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
FEMA has a website you can go and you
 
04:55:30.070 --> 04:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
can download every single flood
 
04:55:31.750 --> 04:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
insurance rate map that is published in
 
04:55:34.590 --> 04:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
the United States for free it is readily
 
04:55:36.910 --> 04:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
available they do have a mapping
 
04:55:39.030 --> 04:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
application and the state also has a
 
04:55:42.110 --> 04:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
mapping a mapping application and it is
 
04:55:46.270 --> 04:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
address and geocoded driven however we
 
04:55:48.230 --> 04:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
have to keep in mind that there are
 
04:55:50.470 --> 04:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
limitations to that information it's
 
04:55:52.910 --> 04:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
like anything if you go to Google Maps
 
04:55:56.110 --> 04:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
or Map Quest or put in an address in
 
04:55:59.708 --> 04:55:59.718 align:start position:0%
your GPS sometimes it will get you there
 
04:56:02.628 --> 04:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
exactly sometimes it will get you close
 
04:56:05.150 --> 04:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it will not even be in the
 
04:56:07.830 --> 04:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
same community so that is information we
 
04:56:11.110 --> 04:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
have to keep in mind um you know there
 
04:56:14.270 --> 04:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
is an entire cottage industry that is
 
04:56:17.030 --> 04:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
related to flood and flooding and it is
 
04:56:20.030 --> 04:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
a multi-billion dollar industry a lot of
 
04:56:21.990 --> 04:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
it has to do with disclosing and
 
04:56:26.070 --> 04:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
providing information on flood status um
 
04:56:28.270 --> 04:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
you know representative Ms mentioned
 
04:56:30.628 --> 04:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
First Street Foundation um I don't want
 
04:56:33.628 --> 04:56:33.638 align:start position:0%
to get into that information cu that's
 
04:56:35.110 --> 04:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
that we could spend hours speaking about
 
04:56:38.590 --> 04:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
that um but the point is there's
 
04:56:40.628 --> 04:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
information out there there's vendors
 
04:56:42.948 --> 04:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
that will provide this information and
 
04:56:45.430 --> 04:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's conflicts in that
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
information and that's what we have to
 
04:56:51.350 --> 04:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
keep in mind and that's why this type of
 
04:56:54.708 --> 04:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement or disclosure is needed
 
04:56:56.670 --> 04:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
because as the property owner you know
 
04:56:58.030 --> 04:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
you are still going to have a
 
04:57:00.310 --> 04:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility of knowing certain
 
04:57:02.750 --> 04:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
statuses of your property it is not the
 
04:57:04.510 --> 04:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
job of government it is not the job of
 
04:57:08.070 --> 04:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
the town to tell you to pay your taxes
 
04:57:11.548 --> 04:57:11.558 align:start position:0%
or to tell you uh what your zoning is or
 
04:57:13.590 --> 04:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
anything else you have a certain
 
04:57:16.910 --> 04:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility as a property owner to be
 
04:57:20.390 --> 04:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
aware of and knowledgeable in you know
 
04:57:22.670 --> 04:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
the status of of your property and and
 
04:57:26.230 --> 04:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
flooding should be an important aspect
 
04:57:28.510 --> 04:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
of that uh I support the bill I
 
04:57:31.350 --> 04:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
certainly support the amendment and you
 
04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
know I support the language um for the
 
04:57:35.470 --> 04:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
the liability also that that
 
04:57:38.470 --> 04:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative Ms is including because
 
04:57:41.510 --> 04:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
without that what will happen is a
 
04:57:44.150 --> 04:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
realtor or a homeowner will simply go to
 
04:57:47.910 --> 04:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
a thirdparty website put in an address
 
04:57:52.230 --> 04:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
receive some form of certification
 
04:57:54.510 --> 04:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
document or perhaps they'll go to A
 
04:57:57.030 --> 04:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
lender and obtain a standard flood
 
04:57:58.868 --> 04:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
Hazard determination form um from A
 
04:58:01.670 --> 04:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
lender or an insurance company and that
 
04:58:05.150 --> 04:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
may be incorrect there may be incorrect
 
04:58:06.830 --> 04:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
or conflicting information on those
 
04:58:10.030 --> 04:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
forms and at that point then it creates
 
04:58:12.030 --> 04:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
a significant liability issue is the
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
real realtor liable for relying on a
 
04:58:17.708 --> 04:58:17.718 align:start position:0%
third party is the homeowner now liable
 
04:58:20.350 --> 04:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
for relying on the realtor who relied on
 
04:58:23.788 --> 04:58:23.798 align:start position:0%
a third party and on and on and on so it
 
04:58:25.390 --> 04:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be very specific if we're going
 
04:58:28.708 --> 04:58:28.718 align:start position:0%
to have a specific requirement for that
 
04:58:31.628 --> 04:58:31.638 align:start position:0%
disclosure and to have the words
 
04:58:34.750 --> 04:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
truthful written in into that
 
04:58:36.910 --> 04:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
legislation then there has to be some
 
04:58:40.590 --> 04:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
aspect of of liability because you know
 
04:58:42.510 --> 04:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
I know a guy who knows a guy that's
 
04:58:44.948 --> 04:58:44.958 align:start position:0%
going to tell me that that property is
 
04:58:46.510 --> 04:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
not in a flood zone and they'll put it
 
04:58:49.470 --> 04:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
in writing and I can guarantee you as
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
the day is long nobody wants to be in a
 
04:58:53.470 --> 04:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
flood zone especially when they're
 
04:58:56.070 --> 04:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
selling property so with that I'm happy
 
04:58:58.030 --> 04:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions uh provide any
 
04:59:00.548 --> 04:59:00.558 align:start position:0%
other information or Insight
 
04:59:02.590 --> 04:59:02.600 align:start position:0%
representative burrow this is just would
 
04:59:04.110 --> 04:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
you know would you believe I just went
 
04:59:06.670 --> 04:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
on the FEMA map and I put in my address
 
04:59:08.590 --> 04:59:08.600 align:start position:0%
and they said the the information was
 
04:59:12.628 --> 04:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
accurate as of 2013 so yeah it's you
 
04:59:14.510 --> 04:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
know it's like anything right um
 
04:59:17.150 --> 04:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
technology is great I'm not a leite uh
 
04:59:19.628 --> 04:59:19.638 align:start position:0%
you know I I embrace and work in
 
04:59:22.110 --> 04:59:22.120 align:start position:0%
technology um but I'm also aware of its
 
04:59:24.190 --> 04:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
limitations and you know that's what we
 
04:59:27.150 --> 04:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
have to be cognizant of uh like the
 
04:59:30.270 --> 04:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
realtor said trust but verify certainly
 
04:59:34.110 --> 04:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
an important um Mantra to live by by um
 
04:59:37.548 --> 04:59:37.558 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to you know an actual
 
04:59:39.548 --> 04:59:39.558 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable disclosure you know we
 
04:59:41.270 --> 04:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that that information
 
04:59:44.590 --> 04:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
is correct and
 
04:59:48.750 --> 04:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:51.150 --> 04:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
truthful represent
 
04:59:53.708 --> 04:59:53.718 align:start position:0%
bam thank you thank you for take my
 
04:59:57.590 --> 04:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
question um could could you tell me um
 
05:00:01.390 --> 05:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
about the 100e uh floods and the 500
 
05:00:04.310 --> 05:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
year flood flooding um is that
 
05:00:07.548 --> 05:00:07.558 align:start position:0%
occurring 500 year is that occurring now
 
05:00:11.708 --> 05:00:11.718 align:start position:0%
sure yeah so it's a misnomer to to use
 
05:00:14.310 --> 05:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
the the term 100 year and 500 year and
 
05:00:16.510 --> 05:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
FEMA has gotten away from that now they
 
05:00:21.510 --> 05:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
use the term um 1% annual chance or 0 2%
 
05:00:23.390 --> 05:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
annual chance which means you have a you
 
05:00:27.070 --> 05:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
know one one one chance out of a
 
05:00:28.788 --> 05:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
100-year potential of flooding in a
 
05:00:32.070 --> 05:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
100-year flood zone um you know one one
 
05:00:34.510 --> 05:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
chance out of 500 year of flooding but
 
05:00:37.670 --> 05:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
again that's a measure of storm
 
05:00:41.390 --> 05:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
discharge and you know in Manchester
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
there are multiple areas that are
 
05:00:47.230 --> 05:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
designated as 500-year flood zones uh
 
05:00:49.868 --> 05:00:49.878 align:start position:0%
those areas flooded in 2005 and then
 
05:00:52.670 --> 05:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
they also flooded again in 2007 there
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
weren't 500 years in between those those
 
05:00:58.750 --> 05:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
floods um but again you know it's a it's
 
05:01:00.510 --> 05:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
a storm discharge it has to do with
 
05:01:03.470 --> 05:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
severity uh and potential frequency and
 
05:01:06.750 --> 05:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:09.788 --> 05:01:09.798 align:start position:0%
discharge great thank you thank you we
 
05:01:18.948 --> 05:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:22.270 --> 05:01:22.280 align:start position:0%

experience I know how to read and
 
05:01:39.510 --> 05:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
interpret a flood map that're called
 
05:01:41.868 --> 05:01:41.878 align:start position:0%
flood insurance rate Maps I know what
 
05:01:43.670 --> 05:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
each of the zones mean and what kind of
 
05:01:46.350 --> 05:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
flooding properties in each Zone could
 
05:01:49.270 --> 05:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
see I also know that this is not common
 
05:01:52.190 --> 05:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge but without this knowledge I
 
05:01:54.750 --> 05:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even know what questions ask
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
let alone where to look to answer my
 
05:02:00.510 --> 05:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
questions the flooding in the last year
 
05:02:02.070 --> 05:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
is something that you will not see
 
05:02:05.110 --> 05:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
reflected in a flood map however signs
 
05:02:07.110 --> 05:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
that you might see on a property such as
 
05:02:09.990 --> 05:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
mold could be cleaned up with bleach and
 
05:02:12.788 --> 05:02:12.798 align:start position:0%
some paint disguising it from potential
 
05:02:14.430 --> 05:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
buyers and
 
05:02:17.070 --> 05:02:17.080 align:start position:0%
renters recently the flooding on the Sea
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
Coast has been seen on the news but it
 
05:02:20.830 --> 05:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't speak to the tremendous losses
 
05:02:23.948 --> 05:02:23.958 align:start position:0%
by property owners and renters people
 
05:02:27.750 --> 05:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
have lost cars washing machines dryers
 
05:02:30.070 --> 05:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
water heaters and so much
 
05:02:32.548 --> 05:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
more this damage means that flooding is
 
05:02:34.350 --> 05:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
on the the Forefront of all of our minds
 
05:02:38.510 --> 05:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
now but will it be in 6 months 1 year 5
 
05:02:41.270 --> 05:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
years passing this bill will mean that
 
05:02:44.230 --> 05:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
it will be remembered and adequately
 
05:02:46.628 --> 05:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
reported when it
 
05:02:50.110 --> 05:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
matters supporting this bill will help
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
people like me to know what to expect
 
05:02:54.270 --> 05:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
and what questions to ask when investing
 
05:02:57.310 --> 05:02:57.320 align:start position:0%
a home and I know that I will be able to
 
05:03:00.350 --> 05:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
use my knowledge of reading flood maps
 
05:03:03.270 --> 05:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
when I go through this process
 
05:03:05.190 --> 05:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
but since this is not common
 
05:03:09.270 --> 05:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge I worry about people who
 
05:03:10.910 --> 05:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
haven't had the opportunity to learn how
 
05:03:13.830 --> 05:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
to do this and even knowing how to do
 
05:03:16.230 --> 05:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
this won't give me the full picture
 
05:03:19.470 --> 05:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
please support this Bill thank
 
05:03:24.270 --> 05:03:24.280 align:start position:0%

everyone

05:05:18.628 --> 05:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:23.470 --> 05:05:23.480 align:start position:0%
okay okay that's simple enough we got
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:31.480 --> 05:05:44.990 align:start position:0%
 
three

05:05:44.990 --> 05:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:47.750 --> 05:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
welcome back to the Commerce
 
05:05:49.708 --> 05:05:49.718 align:start position:0%
Committee thank you so much chair hunt
 
05:05:51.190 --> 05:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure to be back in front of
 
05:05:53.628 --> 05:05:53.638 align:start position:0%
you again representative mea McWilliams
 
05:05:54.590 --> 05:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
from South
 
05:05:56.430 --> 05:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
conquered I've got some handouts that
 
05:05:58.270 --> 05:05:58.280 align:start position:0%
are making their way around uh so I just
 
05:05:59.628 --> 05:05:59.638 align:start position:0%
want to make sure everybody's got that
 
05:06:05.070 --> 05:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
before I dive in um but on a brief brief
 
05:06:07.430 --> 05:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
overview I'm the prime sponsor of House
 
05:06:10.548 --> 05:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
Bill 1498 FN um and this bill is based
 
05:06:12.750 --> 05:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
on a Colorado law that's uh very
 
05:06:15.310 --> 05:06:15.320 align:start position:0%
similarly written uh there are a lot of
 
05:06:17.150 --> 05:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
good reasons to have a Statewide
 
05:06:19.110 --> 05:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals registry and I'll get
 
05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
into that um but Colorado's concerns
 
05:06:23.868 --> 05:06:23.878 align:start position:0%
were mostly law enforcement and making
 
05:06:26.110 --> 05:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
sure that when local law enforcement
 
05:06:28.390 --> 05:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
responded to a disturbance of the piece
 
05:06:29.948 --> 05:06:29.958 align:start position:0%
or some other
 
05:06:32.708 --> 05:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
concern it's very helpful helpful for
 
05:06:34.430 --> 05:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to know whether the
 
05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
property is a short-term rental or owner
 
05:06:39.470 --> 05:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
occupied um so I'll just make sure
 
05:06:40.590 --> 05:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
everybody gets their hand outs and then
 
05:06:48.510 --> 05:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:48.520 --> 05:07:01.310 align:start position:0%
 
it

05:07:01.310 --> 05:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:01.320 --> 05:07:21.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:07:21.150 --> 05:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:23.670 --> 05:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
all right it looks like everybody has um
 
05:07:26.510 --> 05:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
the handout so this is an article from
 
05:07:29.788 --> 05:07:29.798 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Bar Association um and
 
05:07:32.670 --> 05:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
it was originally published in 2023 I
 
05:07:34.270 --> 05:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
think that a lot of this information is
 
05:07:36.310 --> 05:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
still relevant this year
 
05:07:39.750 --> 05:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
2024 um one one change after this
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
article was published at the time it was
 
05:07:44.310 --> 05:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
published the town of Conway versus
 
05:07:46.750 --> 05:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
kudri decision had only been um
 
05:07:49.590 --> 05:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
finalized in the lower court uh since
 
05:07:52.750 --> 05:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
May 2nd of 2023 the superior court of
 
05:07:55.548 --> 05:07:55.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has affirmed the decision
 
05:07:57.910 --> 05:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
um on behalf of kudri so for those of
 
05:08:00.310 --> 05:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
you not familiar with that court case
 
05:08:04.708 --> 05:08:04.718 align:start position:0%
this was a a Conway battle about whether
 
05:08:06.590 --> 05:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
or not someone could have short-term
 
05:08:09.390 --> 05:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
rentals happening on their property um
 
05:08:11.390 --> 05:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
or if it needed to be a special Zone
 
05:08:13.548 --> 05:08:13.558 align:start position:0%
that said short-term rentals can happen
 
05:08:15.948 --> 05:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
within this Zone there was a lot of
 
05:08:17.990 --> 05:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
debate as to whether or not because the
 
05:08:20.788 --> 05:08:20.798 align:start position:0%
town ordinance was silent on that it
 
05:08:24.708 --> 05:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
could be included um and the court sided
 
05:08:27.350 --> 05:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
with the uh the owner of the property so
 
05:08:30.788 --> 05:08:30.798 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals continue in Conway um
 
05:08:31.910 --> 05:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
some interesting things that you can
 
05:08:33.590 --> 05:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
also pull out from this article I'm not
 
05:08:35.270 --> 05:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
asking you to read it now this is good
 
05:08:39.868 --> 05:08:39.878 align:start position:0%
reading for later um but uh in 2023 when
 
05:08:42.830 --> 05:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
this was written only about 30 of the
 
05:08:46.190 --> 05:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
234 municipalities in New Hampshire have
 
05:08:49.708 --> 05:08:49.718 align:start position:0%
local regulations on short-term rentals
 
05:08:52.070 --> 05:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh we are we are one of the few I would
 
05:08:55.868 --> 05:08:55.878 align:start position:0%
say tourism economy States uh at least
 
05:08:57.590 --> 05:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast possibly in the whole
 
05:09:00.628 --> 05:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
country that is not regulating lure of
 
05:09:02.708 --> 05:09:02.718 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals at the state level
 
05:09:04.948 --> 05:09:04.958 align:start position:0%
we've been leaving it up to individual
 
05:09:08.030 --> 05:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh cities and towns uh just from
 
05:09:10.310 --> 05:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
Conway's perspective and to be clear I'm
 
05:09:12.750 --> 05:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
from conquer but Conway has been dealing
 
05:09:14.628 --> 05:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
with this and as an architect I deal
 
05:09:18.150 --> 05:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
with buildings all over the state um
 
05:09:20.788 --> 05:09:20.798 align:start position:0%
Conway had to respond to this somehow
 
05:09:22.750 --> 05:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
because it's become a touris in Mecca
 
05:09:24.708 --> 05:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
and many many many of the properties
 
05:09:27.310 --> 05:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
that are rented out in Conway are owned
 
05:09:29.548 --> 05:09:29.558 align:start position:0%
by landlords who do not actually live in
 
05:09:33.788 --> 05:09:33.798 align:start position:0%
the property um so in response to the
 
05:09:36.470 --> 05:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
Conway versus curic decision in May of
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
2023 where the supremor court affirmed
 
05:09:41.670 --> 05:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the owner uh Conway has
 
05:09:43.470 --> 05:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
since set up
 
05:09:47.788 --> 05:09:47.798 align:start position:0%
a townwide rent uh rental license and
 
05:09:50.910 --> 05:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
inspection program so they've hired
 
05:09:53.590 --> 05:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
folks to manage this they've staffed it
 
05:09:56.670 --> 05:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
up um and starting in September of last
 
05:09:59.390 --> 05:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
year if you owned a short-term rental
 
05:10:01.350 --> 05:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
you could either fill out a form uh for
 
05:10:04.830 --> 05:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
$37 $ 5 and have a three-year inspection
 
05:10:08.390 --> 05:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
or you could fill out a form for $125
 
05:10:10.708 --> 05:10:10.718 align:start position:0%
license and a self affidavit with no
 
05:10:12.590 --> 05:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
inspection uh but then you would have to
 
05:10:16.670 --> 05:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
come back starting tomorrow the 26th of
 
05:10:20.310 --> 05:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
January 2024 um to then apply for an
 
05:10:22.670 --> 05:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
official uh permit so that was sort of a
 
05:10:25.510 --> 05:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
stop Gap uh understanding that Conway
 
05:10:28.708 --> 05:10:28.718 align:start position:0%
has heavily invested in doing some kind
 
05:10:31.310 --> 05:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
of inspections and lure for their
 
05:10:32.708 --> 05:10:32.718 align:start position:0%
short-term rental
 
05:10:34.548 --> 05:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
really begs the question why isn't the
 
05:10:36.470 --> 05:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
state doing that is it really only a
 
05:10:39.310 --> 05:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
problem in Conway and I would say to you
 
05:10:41.070 --> 05:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
that as someone who deals with an awful
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
lot of building Renovations in New
 
05:10:44.670 --> 05:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no it's not just a problem in
 
05:10:46.868 --> 05:10:46.878 align:start position:0%
Conway it's a problem in many many
 
05:10:46.878 --> 05:10:47.708 align:start position:0%
Conway it's a problem in many many
different

05:10:47.708 --> 05:10:47.718 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:10:49.910 --> 05:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
communities uh this is the sort of thing
 
05:10:51.788 --> 05:10:51.798 align:start position:0%
where we would expect to see some kind
 
05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
of guidelines and not a hodg podge of
 
05:10:57.708 --> 05:10:57.718 align:start position:0%
how our short-term rentals regulated um
 
05:10:59.350 --> 05:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
and how do we track them is really the
 
05:11:03.190 --> 05:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
big question so why this bill um number
 
05:11:06.510 --> 05:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
one by establishing a registry the state
 
05:11:08.350 --> 05:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
can regulate and enforce compliance with
 
05:11:10.190 --> 05:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
local laws and regulations related to
 
05:11:12.430 --> 05:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals so this can include
 
05:11:16.350 --> 05:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
zoning safety taxes and Licensing to be
 
05:11:18.868 --> 05:11:18.878 align:start position:0%
clear right now we do require that all
 
05:11:21.390 --> 05:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals still pay taxes to
 
05:11:23.628 --> 05:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue um and if
 
05:11:25.708 --> 05:11:25.718 align:start position:0%
you're using a large vendor like verbo
 
05:11:28.270 --> 05:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
or Airbnb they are collecting the
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
information about all of their
 
05:11:31.788 --> 05:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
properties and submitting the taxes to
 
05:11:33.788 --> 05:11:33.798 align:start position:0%
the the state but they are not
 
05:11:36.430 --> 05:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
submitting that individual data about
 
05:11:37.990 --> 05:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
the property owner's name and the
 
05:11:40.230 --> 05:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
address of the property to submit to the
 
05:11:42.110 --> 05:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
state and I think that that's really
 
05:11:43.788 --> 05:11:43.798 align:start position:0%
where the Gap is when we talk about the
 
05:11:46.030 --> 05:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
Colorado law where there was concern
 
05:11:47.670 --> 05:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
where local law enforcement would really
 
05:11:49.948 --> 05:11:49.958 align:start position:0%
like to know when they respond is it a
 
05:11:51.470 --> 05:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
short-term rental or is it owner
 
05:11:53.390 --> 05:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
occupied so this is about data
 
05:11:55.270 --> 05:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
transparency and making sure that when
 
05:11:56.708 --> 05:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
you're responding to an incident you
 
05:11:59.470 --> 05:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
have all the information um so enhanced
 
05:12:01.230 --> 05:12:01.240 align:start position:0%
safety measures a registry enables
 
05:12:03.510 --> 05:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
authorities to to ensure that short-term
 
05:12:05.910 --> 05:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
rental properties meet safety standards
 
05:12:07.990 --> 05:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
obviously Conway is doing inspections
 
05:12:09.948 --> 05:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
and I'm not proposing inspections across
 
05:12:11.150 --> 05:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
the state but I'm telling you that's
 
05:12:13.310 --> 05:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
where we're headed um in terms of Life
 
05:12:14.910 --> 05:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
Safety there needs to be at least an
 
05:12:17.070 --> 05:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
egress window from every residential
 
05:12:19.670 --> 05:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
bedroom um short-term rental properties
 
05:12:21.190 --> 05:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
need to meet safety standards fire
 
05:12:23.708 --> 05:12:23.718 align:start position:0%
safety building codes so having this
 
05:12:25.470 --> 05:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
information helps protect renters and
 
05:12:27.110 --> 05:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
neighboring properties from potential
 
05:12:29.830 --> 05:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
hazards also nuisance concerns local law
 
05:12:31.390 --> 05:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement can use the registry to
 
05:12:32.948 --> 05:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
address concerns related to noise
 
05:12:35.350 --> 05:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
complaints parking violations other
 
05:12:37.190 --> 05:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
nuisances associated with short-term
 
05:12:39.670 --> 05:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
rentals having a centralized database of
 
05:12:41.310 --> 05:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
rental properties makes it easier to
 
05:12:43.030 --> 05:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
respond to these issues
 
05:12:45.590 --> 05:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
promptly it also improves tax collection
 
05:12:46.910 --> 05:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
property owners who rent out their
 
05:12:48.990 --> 05:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
properties through platforms like airbn
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
ver Airbnb or verbo are often required
 
05:12:53.708 --> 05:12:53.718 align:start position:0%
to pay occupancy taxes as we do in New
 
05:12:56.070 --> 05:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire registry facilitates tax
 
05:12:57.670 --> 05:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
collection providing a comprehensive
 
05:13:00.628 --> 05:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
list of all not just the big vendors um
 
05:13:02.350 --> 05:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
all of the rental property and their
 
05:13:04.910 --> 05:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
owners even if it's individually owned
 
05:13:06.788 --> 05:13:06.798 align:start position:0%
it's a protection for renters renters
 
05:13:08.548 --> 05:13:08.558 align:start position:0%
benefit from registry by having access
 
05:13:10.150 --> 05:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
to information about the registered
 
05:13:12.190 --> 05:13:12.200 align:start position:0%
rental properties including contact
 
05:13:13.990 --> 05:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
information for property owners or
 
05:13:16.430 --> 05:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
managers this helps ensure transparency
 
05:13:18.110 --> 05:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
and accountability and Rental
 
05:13:20.830 --> 05:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
transactions also Fair competition a
 
05:13:22.190 --> 05:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
registry can help level the playing
 
05:13:23.788 --> 05:13:23.798 align:start position:0%
field for property owners by ensuring
 
05:13:25.430 --> 05:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
that all short-term rental properties
 
05:13:27.230 --> 05:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
operate under the same set of rules and
 
05:13:29.708 --> 05:13:29.718 align:start position:0%
regulations this preent prevents unfair
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
advantages for unregistered or illegal
 
05:13:34.788 --> 05:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
rentals and finally data collection and
 
05:13:37.430 --> 05:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
planning our state government can use
 
05:13:39.390 --> 05:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
the data from the registry to analyze
 
05:13:42.030 --> 05:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
Trends in the short-term rental market
 
05:13:44.868 --> 05:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
town by Town year by year and assess the
 
05:13:47.190 --> 05:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
impact on housing affordability to make
 
05:13:48.670 --> 05:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
informed decisions about future
 
05:13:53.310 --> 05:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
regulations and policies so th that's my
 
05:13:55.070 --> 05:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
quick down and dirty explanation about
 
05:13:58.110 --> 05:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
the bill um and the intent of the bill
 
05:13:59.670 --> 05:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer questions and I know
 
05:14:01.030 --> 05:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
there are people after me that will
 
05:14:04.548 --> 05:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
likely test on this thank you represent
 
05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you um I'm just kind of
 
05:14:09.310 --> 05:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
curious about the enforcement so it's
 
05:14:12.430 --> 05:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
pretty easy it's pretty easy
 
05:14:16.030 --> 05:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
for for a municipality or even the state
 
05:14:17.628 --> 05:14:17.638 align:start position:0%
to identify say a hotel or something
 
05:14:19.310 --> 05:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
like that but if I just wanted to rent
 
05:14:24.190 --> 05:14:24.200 align:start position:0%
out my house short term um what is
 
05:14:26.548 --> 05:14:26.558 align:start position:0%
like what's the enforcement for somebody
 
05:14:29.350 --> 05:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
who a doesn't know about this or B who
 
05:14:32.470 --> 05:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
consciously chooses not to role in this
 
05:14:34.990 --> 05:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
system or register I mean it seems like
 
05:14:37.270 --> 05:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
that it seems like it' be really hard
 
05:14:39.708 --> 05:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
for the state to actually monitor it and
 
05:14:41.310 --> 05:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
particularly a bad faith
 
05:14:44.430 --> 05:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
actor so we currently require everyone
 
05:14:47.390 --> 05:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
who's renting out short-term rentals to
 
05:14:49.510 --> 05:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
to pay tax on that and if you're doing
 
05:14:51.948 --> 05:14:51.958 align:start position:0%
it under the radar or illegally then
 
05:14:53.948 --> 05:14:53.958 align:start position:0%
you're avoiding paying tax on that and
 
05:14:55.350 --> 05:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
when you get caught then you you're
 
05:14:58.150 --> 05:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
fined for failing to do that so it's the
 
05:15:00.150 --> 05:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
how you get caught is the piece that you
 
05:15:02.110 --> 05:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
know generally it's law enforcement
 
05:15:03.788 --> 05:15:03.798 align:start position:0%
responding to a noise ordinance multiple
 
05:15:05.270 --> 05:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
times to one property till they figure
 
05:15:07.910 --> 05:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
out oh this is an owner
 
05:15:09.910 --> 05:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
occupied forther question for the
 
05:15:12.670 --> 05:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
question uh so my other question is kind
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
of related to that what are the
 
05:15:16.670 --> 05:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
requirements like how do we Define that
 
05:15:18.750 --> 05:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
exactly because let's say I have my
 
05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
house and I live in there and then I
 
05:15:21.750 --> 05:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
just want to rent it when I go on
 
05:15:23.350 --> 05:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
vacation twice a year to help pay for my
 
05:15:25.230 --> 05:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
vacation does that have to be registered
 
05:15:27.548 --> 05:15:27.558 align:start position:0%
as well that's an awesome question and I
 
05:15:29.270 --> 05:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
have a bill to follow up on that after
 
05:15:31.230 --> 05:15:31.240 align:start position:0%
this bill uh New Hampshire has not yet
 
05:15:33.390 --> 05:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
defined find short-term rental across
 
05:15:35.948 --> 05:15:35.958 align:start position:0%
all of our different sections of rsas
 
05:15:38.390 --> 05:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
and so I have a contiguous bill that
 
05:15:40.470 --> 05:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
addresses that in about 20 minutes stay
 
05:15:40.480 --> 05:15:42.310 align:start position:0%
addresses that in about 20 minutes stay
tuned

05:15:42.310 --> 05:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
tuned
 
05:15:45.548 --> 05:15:45.558 align:start position:0%
yes representative brows thanks for
 
05:15:48.430 --> 05:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my question is
 
05:15:50.750 --> 05:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
This Town of Bartlett is looking closely
 
05:15:52.548 --> 05:15:52.558 align:start position:0%
at what Conway is doing and and they're
 
05:15:54.230 --> 05:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
in the process of putting together
 
05:15:57.230 --> 05:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
something similar to that so a lot of
 
05:15:58.510 --> 05:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
the towns are going to saying this is
 
05:16:00.270 --> 05:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
our job not the states so I was
 
05:16:01.868 --> 05:16:01.878 align:start position:0%
wondering how how what your thoughts is
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
on that um I think that I'm trying to
 
05:16:07.150 --> 05:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
split this so that lure goes under the
 
05:16:10.270 --> 05:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
state but inspection goes under the town
 
05:16:11.708 --> 05:16:11.718 align:start position:0%
um so things that have to do with life
 
05:16:13.270 --> 05:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
safety like I said um making sure
 
05:16:14.590 --> 05:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
there's a means of erress from every
 
05:16:16.230 --> 05:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
bedroom would still be the town's
 
05:16:17.788 --> 05:16:17.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility whereas the state is
 
05:16:20.070 --> 05:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
really focused on lure because they
 
05:16:22.310 --> 05:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
already have this data anyway when it
 
05:16:24.670 --> 05:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
comes to receiving the tax money they
 
05:16:26.430 --> 05:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
just don't have it split out by
 
05:16:29.150 --> 05:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
individual property and owner but they
 
05:16:30.708 --> 05:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
could it's just a different way of
 
05:16:32.510 --> 05:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
tracking it and pursing out the data to
 
05:16:36.230 --> 05:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
municipality representative M thank you
 
05:16:40.510 --> 05:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:16:42.708 --> 05:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
question what sort of inspections do you
 
05:16:45.910 --> 05:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
envision the state or the municipalities
 
05:16:47.750 --> 05:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
doing on what are essentially many
 
05:16:50.190 --> 05:16:50.200 align:start position:0%
people's private dwellings for the most
 
05:16:53.590 --> 05:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
part that's an awesome question um so I
 
05:16:55.628 --> 05:16:55.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier excuse me I mentioned
 
05:16:57.788 --> 05:16:57.798 align:start position:0%
earlier that I'm an architect um so one
 
05:16:58.868 --> 05:16:58.878 align:start position:0%
of the things that you need to do in
 
05:17:00.750 --> 05:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
order to get a building permit is to
 
05:17:02.070 --> 05:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
have an inspection
 
05:17:03.750 --> 05:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
so every time you do a renovation to a
 
05:17:05.190 --> 05:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
building you're going to need to get
 
05:17:06.990 --> 05:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
that inspection to get your final
 
05:17:09.470 --> 05:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
certificate of occupancy unless it's a
 
05:17:10.910 --> 05:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
really small renovation it doesn't
 
05:17:12.788 --> 05:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
require a permit but generally you're
 
05:17:14.708 --> 05:17:14.718 align:start position:0%
going to need a permit so if you're
 
05:17:17.030 --> 05:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
talking about um getting a license
 
05:17:20.310 --> 05:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
through the town so Bartlett Conway
 
05:17:21.750 --> 05:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to require as part of the
 
05:17:23.708 --> 05:17:23.718 align:start position:0%
licensure process you're getting
 
05:17:25.548 --> 05:17:25.558 align:start position:0%
licensed to have short-term rentals you
 
05:17:27.070 --> 05:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
need to have an inspection by the code
 
05:17:29.070 --> 05:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
official just as if you were having some
 
05:17:30.590 --> 05:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
kind of certificate of occupancy
 
05:17:34.548 --> 05:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:38.628 --> 05:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
permit okay um what what was the feed to
 
05:17:40.948 --> 05:17:40.958 align:start position:0%
to be registered with did I don't see
 
05:17:43.788 --> 05:17:43.798 align:start position:0%
any fees in here uh I did not put a fee
 
05:17:45.270 --> 05:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
in here I left it up to the Department
 
05:17:49.350 --> 05:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
of Revenue Administration okay so uh I'm
 
05:17:50.750 --> 05:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
going to shock
 
05:17:54.830 --> 05:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
you I think this is a great Bill
 
05:17:57.350 --> 05:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
except I want it
 
05:17:59.750 --> 05:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
locally I don't want the state involved
 
05:18:01.948 --> 05:18:01.958 align:start position:0%
the state right now it's more
 
05:18:05.390 --> 05:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
complicated than you know because there
 
05:18:07.390 --> 05:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
are people like me who've been renting
 
05:18:11.788 --> 05:18:11.798 align:start position:0%
long before VRBO and home and in Airbnb
 
05:18:15.350 --> 05:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
made the deal about the tax so I have a
 
05:18:18.548 --> 05:18:18.558 align:start position:0%
state ID uh tax number already I've had
 
05:18:19.788 --> 05:18:19.798 align:start position:0%
it since
 
05:18:21.910 --> 05:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
2009 okay and I still have plenty of
 
05:18:24.310 --> 05:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
renters that come in on that and then
 
05:18:27.110 --> 05:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
and I hate the verbo and because I'm a
 
05:18:29.750 --> 05:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
verbo because I have to pay the credit
 
05:18:32.430 --> 05:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
card fees for the
 
05:18:35.628 --> 05:18:35.638 align:start position:0%
tax R ridiculous I can't recoup that
 
05:18:39.030 --> 05:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's outrageous yeah so we I actually
 
05:18:42.270 --> 05:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored a bill was it last two
 
05:18:46.270 --> 05:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
years now right that doing what you want
 
05:18:49.868 --> 05:18:49.878 align:start position:0%
to do which is that allow each town or
 
05:18:53.830 --> 05:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
city to set up a li have a lure and it
 
05:18:56.830 --> 05:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
falls into John Hunt's rule of lure that
 
05:18:59.430 --> 05:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
if you screw up they take your license
 
05:19:02.830 --> 05:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
away shut you down and in that
 
05:19:06.150 --> 05:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
lure you the town it because very
 
05:19:08.350 --> 05:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
important the town needs to know who's
 
05:19:10.190 --> 05:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
the contact person and in it is a
 
05:19:12.230 --> 05:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
requirement that that contact person has
 
05:19:14.548 --> 05:19:14.558 align:start position:0%
to be a New Hampshire resident has to be
 
05:19:16.470 --> 05:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so that person in
 
05:19:18.788 --> 05:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts who who bought that Ski
 
05:19:20.430 --> 05:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
Lodge you know they've got to find
 
05:19:20.440 --> 05:19:21.430 align:start position:0%
Lodge you know they've got to find
somebody

05:19:21.430 --> 05:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:19:23.910 --> 05:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
locally that's good for the reers you
 
05:19:25.948 --> 05:19:25.958 align:start position:0%
know that uh that they get somebody
 
05:19:27.750 --> 05:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
local who will be the person who will
 
05:19:30.548 --> 05:19:30.558 align:start position:0%
respond and go shut that rowdy crowd
 
05:19:33.070 --> 05:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
down someone who's respon keep you know
 
05:19:35.670 --> 05:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on it um my fire department
 
05:19:37.590 --> 05:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely came in and they measured all
 
05:19:39.948 --> 05:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
my windows to make sure they were big
 
05:19:42.548 --> 05:19:42.558 align:start position:0%
enough for people to jump out of not
 
05:19:43.830 --> 05:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
that you want to jump out of a third
 
05:19:46.670 --> 05:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
story Castle but you know they measured
 
05:19:49.830 --> 05:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
that window okay so I I think it's fine
 
05:19:51.670 --> 05:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
are you okay with just converting this
 
05:19:55.350 --> 05:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
into a local Municipal one rather
 
05:19:57.470 --> 05:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation for municipalities
 
05:20:00.190 --> 05:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
to implement rather than have the state
 
05:20:02.070 --> 05:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure Dr the last thing they want
 
05:20:05.670 --> 05:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
to do is be tracking something that like
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
Li this kind of LC I'm sure they would
 
05:20:11.030 --> 05:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
rather not do this so a couple of points
 
05:20:13.430 --> 05:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
to what you just said um if it was
 
05:20:16.350 --> 05:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 249 that you co-sponsored is
 
05:20:17.788 --> 05:20:17.798 align:start position:0%
that the one that stoed out for local
 
05:20:20.190 --> 05:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
control was the bill okay I would have
 
05:20:21.750 --> 05:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
loved to have seen that bill pass that
 
05:20:24.628 --> 05:20:24.638 align:start position:0%
was an awesome Bill BR that solved a
 
05:20:27.708 --> 05:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
large portion of this concern um perfect
 
05:20:28.788 --> 05:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I told you I was
 
05:20:30.030 --> 05:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
going to surprise you yeah I might
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
surprise you too um so one of one of the
 
05:20:35.948 --> 05:20:35.958 align:start position:0%
reasons that uh Colorado went at the
 
05:20:38.230 --> 05:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
state level was because it was more
 
05:20:41.110 --> 05:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
efficient in terms of staff to manage
 
05:20:43.990 --> 05:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
the data at one Central Point rather
 
05:20:46.590 --> 05:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
than over 200 different individual
 
05:20:49.110 --> 05:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
communities and staffers so we're
 
05:20:52.470 --> 05:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
talking about a handful of people who
 
05:20:55.670 --> 05:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
manage the database rather than one
 
05:20:57.670 --> 05:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
maybe two people at every single
 
05:21:00.030 --> 05:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
municipality across New Hampshire so we
 
05:21:02.830 --> 05:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
have a lot more staff engaged if we do
 
05:21:05.390 --> 05:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
it at the local level but to the point
 
05:21:06.788 --> 05:21:06.798 align:start position:0%
that I brought up earlier with
 
05:21:09.110 --> 05:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative Burrows I do think that
 
05:21:11.190 --> 05:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
this needs to be handled at both the
 
05:21:13.390 --> 05:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
local level and the state level which is
 
05:21:15.390 --> 05:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
why I've split out lure at the state
 
05:21:16.708 --> 05:21:16.718 align:start position:0%
level where they're already getting the
 
05:21:19.628 --> 05:21:19.638 align:start position:0%
data on taxes but I think inspections
 
05:21:21.548 --> 05:21:21.558 align:start position:0%
really needs to be local and it should
 
05:21:24.548 --> 05:21:24.558 align:start position:0%
be each town by Town setting that up so
 
05:21:26.270 --> 05:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
if there's a way to you haven't really
 
05:21:27.430 --> 05:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
cut out the
 
05:21:31.030 --> 05:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
town part I mean you still the town has
 
05:21:32.470 --> 05:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
has the same of bureaucracy if they
 
05:21:34.788 --> 05:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
still have to do all those inspections
 
05:21:36.830 --> 05:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
and do all those visits and do all that
 
05:21:39.830 --> 05:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
stuff did did you visualize there was a
 
05:21:41.590 --> 05:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
computer database that people could
 
05:21:44.150 --> 05:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
access see that list or something I mean
 
05:21:45.750 --> 05:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
I don't understand what you're what
 
05:21:47.990 --> 05:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're because I have visual that each
 
05:21:51.628 --> 05:21:51.638 align:start position:0%
town a person applies for this and the
 
05:21:54.590 --> 05:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
town would have a file box and have you
 
05:21:57.430 --> 05:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
alphabetically in that file box and and
 
05:21:58.750 --> 05:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
then they would have to make sure that
 
05:22:00.590 --> 05:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
the fire department's checked you off
 
05:22:02.510 --> 05:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
make sure you're all up to dat in your
 
05:22:04.948 --> 05:22:04.958 align:start position:0%
files and maybe you know on an annual
 
05:22:07.030 --> 05:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
basis require you to you know update
 
05:22:09.030 --> 05:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
your file so I don't understand how
 
05:22:11.230 --> 05:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
that's any bureaucracy to a town to
 
05:22:14.708 --> 05:22:14.718 align:start position:0%
implement so I agree with you um I'm
 
05:22:16.230 --> 05:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
thinking an Excel spreadsheet I think
 
05:22:17.868 --> 05:22:17.878 align:start position:0%
you and I are for generations for
 
05:22:19.788 --> 05:22:19.798 align:start position:0%
organizations I know EXL better than you
 
05:22:22.230 --> 05:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
do because I was with Microsoft I
 
05:22:26.270 --> 05:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
actually I was I was with um lootus 123
 
05:22:28.990 --> 05:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
oh boy oh how about vizzy Cal wow I was
 
05:22:31.708 --> 05:22:31.718 align:start position:0%
the original spreadsheet okay so don't
 
05:22:33.628 --> 05:22:33.638 align:start position:0%
tell me you know more about spreadsheets
 
05:22:34.510 --> 05:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
we're not going to compete on
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets here but the idea is that
 
05:22:38.350 --> 05:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
nonetheless there's a centralized
 
05:22:40.670 --> 05:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
manager of the database which in my mind
 
05:22:43.230 --> 05:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
is Dr because someone has to manage that
 
05:22:45.110 --> 05:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
database and if it's just one manager of
 
05:22:47.350 --> 05:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
the database rather than 200 some OD
 
05:22:49.070 --> 05:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
communities right because they'd all be
 
05:22:51.270 --> 05:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
inputting into a shared database let the
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
town figure out what they need for their
 
05:22:56.750 --> 05:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
town let them I I would assume the town
 
05:22:58.590 --> 05:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
right now had you know in terms of the
 
05:22:59.670 --> 05:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
spreadsh sheets whether they do it
 
05:23:01.548 --> 05:23:01.558 align:start position:0%
through their planning department
 
05:23:03.788 --> 05:23:03.798 align:start position:0%
um in my case and I no doubt in my town
 
05:23:05.910 --> 05:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
it would be the fire department will be
 
05:23:08.070 --> 05:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
maintaining it right that makes sense
 
05:23:09.910 --> 05:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
for Life Safety you and and because they
 
05:23:11.948 --> 05:23:11.958 align:start position:0%
do the life safety yeah and they got to
 
05:23:13.310 --> 05:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
know where the property is they got to
 
05:23:15.230 --> 05:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
know you know and they'll know who who
 
05:23:17.628 --> 05:23:17.638 align:start position:0%
to call if there's a problem so it's it
 
05:23:19.470 --> 05:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
maintaining a spreadsheets a brilliant
 
05:23:22.590 --> 05:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
idea so I think we are very close to a
 
05:23:24.310 --> 05:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
consensus on what could work with this
 
05:23:25.830 --> 05:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
bill it probably needs a bit of an
 
05:23:27.788 --> 05:23:27.798 align:start position:0%
amendment but I
 
05:23:30.270 --> 05:23:30.280 align:start position:0%
think P original bill yeah but I think
 
05:23:31.830 --> 05:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
we'll take out
 
05:23:34.350 --> 05:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
controversial piece in that bill which
 
05:23:37.030 --> 05:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
was that that towns would be Pro that
 
05:23:39.990 --> 05:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
they couldn't ban it all together that's
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
why it died in in Municipal County
 
05:23:44.030 --> 05:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
government but now that we have this
 
05:23:47.150 --> 05:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision we do we don't
 
05:23:49.390 --> 05:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
have to sweat that issue do we now no
 
05:23:51.350 --> 05:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's been resolved so now it's our job
 
05:23:53.510 --> 05:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
as legislators to promulgate this yeah
 
05:23:57.150 --> 05:23:57.160 align:start position:0%
perfect okay cool okay all right any
 
05:23:57.160 --> 05:23:58.670 align:start position:0%
perfect okay cool okay all right any
other

05:23:58.670 --> 05:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:24:01.548 --> 05:24:01.558 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
05:24:04.070 --> 05:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay Mr
 
05:24:06.670 --> 05:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
Wong it's always welcome back I don't
 
05:24:15.990 --> 05:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:17.948 --> 05:24:17.958 align:start position:0%
years good afternoon members of the
 
05:24:19.830 --> 05:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Keen Mong tax
 
05:24:21.150 --> 05:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
policy council with the New Hampshire
 
05:24:23.910 --> 05:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue uh the the
 
05:24:25.628 --> 05:24:25.638 align:start position:0%
department does not have a position on
 
05:24:28.390 --> 05:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
the bill um and listening to the uh
 
05:24:30.070 --> 05:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
previous conversation I'm not really
 
05:24:33.548 --> 05:24:33.558 align:start position:0%
sure um there's really much for us to uh
 
05:24:35.628 --> 05:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
to bring up but since I'm here just want
 
05:24:38.070 --> 05:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
to give you some um some background in
 
05:24:40.910 --> 05:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
terms of the uh the m and rooms license
 
05:24:44.788 --> 05:24:44.798 align:start position:0%
licensing uh for uh for operators of uh
 
05:24:48.788 --> 05:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
room rentals um essentially so if you're
 
05:24:52.030 --> 05:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
talking about um room
 
05:24:54.390 --> 05:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
facilitators something like a Airbnb or
 
05:24:57.910 --> 05:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
VB uh they are required to obtain a uh
 
05:25:01.548 --> 05:25:01.558 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R license with the Department um
 
05:25:03.350 --> 05:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
their requirement is just to get one
 
05:25:05.628 --> 05:25:05.638 align:start position:0%
license that that covers all all their
 
05:25:07.510 --> 05:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
properties they they're not listing each
 
05:25:10.708 --> 05:25:10.718 align:start position:0%
and every property uh that is under
 
05:25:13.708 --> 05:25:13.718 align:start position:0%
their care uh it it looks like it's
 
05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
going to be a administrative burden on
 
05:25:19.150 --> 05:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
them because every time some property
 
05:25:21.190 --> 05:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
comes into their field and or leaves
 
05:25:23.788 --> 05:25:23.798 align:start position:0%
their field then they might need to
 
05:25:27.110 --> 05:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
reapply uh for for the license so um so
 
05:25:30.430 --> 05:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
current currently the uh owner operators
 
05:25:32.910 --> 05:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
who don't who do not use uh a
 
05:25:35.390 --> 05:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
facilitator will have to obtain an M&amp;R
 
05:25:37.510 --> 05:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
license on their own the room
 
05:25:40.670 --> 05:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
facilitators would obtain an M&amp;R license
 
05:25:44.390 --> 05:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh a an owner operator who uses a room
 
05:25:47.670 --> 05:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
facilitator would not be uh required to
 
05:25:51.390 --> 05:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
obtain an M&amp;R license um so this bill
 
05:25:54.390 --> 05:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
seems to the the way we read the bill
 
05:25:57.470 --> 05:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
seems to require um that owner operators
 
05:26:00.788 --> 05:26:00.798 align:start position:0%
who use facilitators to still to to
 
05:26:04.110 --> 05:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
obtain an M&amp;R license as well as as well
 
05:26:05.948 --> 05:26:05.958 align:start position:0%
as the uh the room facilitators having
 
05:26:08.548 --> 05:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
to obtain an M&amp;R license for each
 
05:26:12.990 --> 05:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
location um so and then the other thing
 
05:26:18.788 --> 05:26:18.798 align:start position:0%
that we noted on this bill is hang on
 
05:26:22.590 --> 05:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
sorry oh yes um the um the providing the
 
05:26:25.868 --> 05:26:25.878 align:start position:0%
information to the municipalities um if
 
05:26:27.990 --> 05:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
this is going to happen I probably we
 
05:26:29.310 --> 05:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
suggest that some additional language
 
05:26:31.150 --> 05:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
should be added in there to specify the
 
05:26:33.070 --> 05:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
frequency of that sharing of that
 
05:26:35.310 --> 05:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
information uh and and how that
 
05:26:37.310 --> 05:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
information is going to be shared and uh
 
05:26:39.548 --> 05:26:39.558 align:start position:0%
to whom at the local municipalities that
 
05:26:41.430 --> 05:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
this information is going to be sent to
 
05:26:44.628 --> 05:26:44.638 align:start position:0%
um and um that's I'm here to answer any
 
05:26:46.150 --> 05:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
questions so we could take all that
 
05:26:47.948 --> 05:26:47.958 align:start position:0%
stuff away from me you you think was
 
05:26:50.310 --> 05:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
great because I was just thinking that
 
05:26:53.190 --> 05:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
that because I'm I'm I'm predate the the
 
05:26:57.110 --> 05:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
deal call it the deal but uh so and
 
05:26:58.910 --> 05:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
often I have months where I have no
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
rentals but I'm still required to file
 
05:27:03.750 --> 05:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
with you right so theoretically all
 
05:27:06.510 --> 05:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
these people who now don't do any filing
 
05:27:07.990 --> 05:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
because they do they pay their tax
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
through the Airbnb verbo now they would
 
05:27:14.230 --> 05:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
have to file monthly and tell you that
 
05:27:15.990 --> 05:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't have any rentals when really
 
05:27:18.390 --> 05:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
they did you're just the taxes being
 
05:27:20.430 --> 05:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
paid a different way so that would
 
05:27:23.788 --> 05:27:23.798 align:start position:0%
actually create a even more bureaucratic
 
05:27:26.230 --> 05:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
nightmare for for you guys that that's
 
05:27:28.670 --> 05:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
what we expect to um because all
 
05:27:30.750 --> 05:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
operators are required to file an M&amp;R
 
05:27:33.350 --> 05:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
return even though they have zero
 
05:27:36.270 --> 05:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
activity right um so those owner
 
05:27:39.390 --> 05:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
operators who are using rental fac room
 
05:27:42.030 --> 05:27:42.040 align:start position:0%
facilitators they are an operator and
 
05:27:44.190 --> 05:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
then the and they have an M&amp;R license
 
05:27:46.628 --> 05:27:46.638 align:start position:0%
the room facilitators have an uh a
 
05:27:48.470 --> 05:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
license as well so there'll potentially
 
05:27:51.830 --> 05:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
be two M&amp;R returns one being a zero
 
05:27:54.868 --> 05:27:54.878 align:start position:0%
return and one with with value in it um
 
05:27:56.830 --> 05:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
yes it will increase
 
05:27:56.840 --> 05:27:58.350 align:start position:0%
yes it will increase
administrative

05:27:58.350 --> 05:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
05:28:01.030 --> 05:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
activity excellent
 
05:28:02.230 --> 05:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from the committee
 
05:28:02.240 --> 05:28:03.548 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from the committee
members

05:28:03.548 --> 05:28:03.558 align:start position:0%
members
 
05:28:07.708 --> 05:28:07.718 align:start position:0%
seeing seeing none thank you thank you
 
05:28:09.910 --> 05:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
got one more car card left Sarah Holland
 
05:28:12.110 --> 05:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire reals who's
 
05:28:15.470 --> 05:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
bill then we have another
 
05:28:26.150 --> 05:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:28.430 --> 05:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
different thank you again chair and
 
05:28:30.430 --> 05:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
committee members um Sarah Holland new
 
05:28:32.390 --> 05:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
hire Association of Realtors opposed to
 
05:28:35.628 --> 05:28:35.638 align:start position:0%
the bill in its current form um we're
 
05:28:37.708 --> 05:28:37.718 align:start position:0%
not entirely clear that the bill
 
05:28:40.910 --> 05:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
achieves the sponsor's intent um and I
 
05:28:43.270 --> 05:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
think that there as previously discussed
 
05:28:44.830 --> 05:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
that there are some other bills that we
 
05:28:48.830 --> 05:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
could probably bring back in form of 249
 
05:28:51.350 --> 05:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
that would would um accomplish what it
 
05:28:53.948 --> 05:28:53.958 align:start position:0%
is that she was looking to do but on a
 
05:28:57.310 --> 05:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
local level um several years ago the
 
05:29:00.708 --> 05:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
legislation amended RSA 78 A7 to require
 
05:29:02.910 --> 05:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
room facilitators to demand and remit
 
05:29:05.510 --> 05:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax room facilitators
 
05:29:08.430 --> 05:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
are those entities like Airbnb VRBO and
 
05:29:12.430 --> 05:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
other similar internet platforms um we
 
05:29:15.150 --> 05:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
believe that the compliance of this has
 
05:29:17.670 --> 05:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
increased and with it State revenues we
 
05:29:20.628 --> 05:29:20.638 align:start position:0%
estimate that over $40 million in the
 
05:29:22.470 --> 05:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
current state budget comes directly from
 
05:29:26.230 --> 05:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals so current Law
 
05:29:28.628 --> 05:29:28.638 align:start position:0%
requires short-term rental operators to
 
05:29:30.708 --> 05:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
obtain a meals and rooms license and
 
05:29:32.390 --> 05:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
also require short-term rental
 
05:29:34.270 --> 05:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
properties who don't use those
 
05:29:36.310 --> 05:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
facilitators so if I were to hire a
 
05:29:39.230 --> 05:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
management company so to speak um to
 
05:29:41.590 --> 05:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
manage my short-term rental company if I
 
05:29:43.430 --> 05:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
did not do that I would need to register
 
05:29:46.990 --> 05:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
on my own um and as uh previously stated
 
05:29:50.390 --> 05:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
by the gentleman from Dr um having two
 
05:29:53.750 --> 05:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
licenses one person so vbo remitting the
 
05:29:56.670 --> 05:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
tax and then me as an independent um
 
05:30:00.350 --> 05:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
property owner who has their property on
 
05:30:03.670 --> 05:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
vo vbo um submitting a report saying
 
05:30:05.628 --> 05:30:05.638 align:start position:0%
zero revenue is a bit of an
 
05:30:07.750 --> 05:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
administrative and Reconciliation
 
05:30:10.190 --> 05:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
nightmare um if the purpose of the bill
 
05:30:13.230 --> 05:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
is transparency of which properties
 
05:30:17.190 --> 05:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
Airbnb and vbo facilitate I think that
 
05:30:19.190 --> 05:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
um the the bill certainly does not
 
05:30:23.670 --> 05:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
achieve that either um and if we would
 
05:30:26.470 --> 05:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
like to speak about
 
05:30:28.910 --> 05:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
249 we would be happy to engage in
 
05:30:31.110 --> 05:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
conversation about that and support that
 
05:30:31.120 --> 05:30:33.310 align:start position:0%
conversation about that and support that
as

05:30:33.310 --> 05:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:35.788 --> 05:30:35.798 align:start position:0%
well and I'm Bob Quinn I'm the CEO of
 
05:30:36.868 --> 05:30:36.878 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of
 
05:30:39.470 --> 05:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
Realtors had intended to speak but since
 
05:30:41.590 --> 05:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
249 was brought up I thought i''d come
 
05:30:42.868 --> 05:30:42.878 align:start position:0%
up just in case there were any questions
 
05:30:47.708 --> 05:30:47.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:51.590 --> 05:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
so okay I guess I guess everybody's all
 
05:30:54.788 --> 05:30:54.798 align:start position:0%
set a thank
 
05:30:59.150 --> 05:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:59.160 --> 05:31:01.310 align:start position:0%
 
hearing

05:31:01.310 --> 05:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:31:03.990 --> 05:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the no it died in the house yeah just
 
05:31:07.270 --> 05:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
so everybody know 249 died u in the
 
05:31:09.830 --> 05:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
missal County government and it died
 
05:31:13.310 --> 05:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
because it had a a little Sticky Wicket
 
05:31:17.868 --> 05:31:17.878 align:start position:0%
attached to it and that was um to say
 
05:31:20.830 --> 05:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
that no town could
 
05:31:24.990 --> 05:31:25.000 align:start position:0%

you fill out a pink card you don't have
 
05:32:06.150 --> 05:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
to sign okay we close at public hearing
 
05:32:09.190 --> 05:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
1498 we'll open a public Hearing in 1635
 
05:32:11.788 --> 05:32:11.798 align:start position:0%
and here from represented Mick
 
05:32:14.548 --> 05:32:14.558 align:start position:0%
willans what a welcome opportunity to
 
05:32:16.670 --> 05:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
see you again thank you so much CH hunt
 
05:32:21.390 --> 05:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure to be back again um I'm
 
05:32:24.070 --> 05:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of House Bill 1635 um
 
05:32:26.470 --> 05:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
relative to the definition of short-term
 
05:32:28.910 --> 05:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
rental um so representative Sullivan
 
05:32:30.628 --> 05:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
preempted me on the previous spill but
 
05:32:32.310 --> 05:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
now we're here to discuss coming up with
 
05:32:35.708 --> 05:32:35.718 align:start position:0%
a common unified definition uh and I
 
05:32:37.390 --> 05:32:37.400 align:start position:0%
think that this may have been a piece of
 
05:32:41.190 --> 05:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
the argument in the Conway uh case and
 
05:32:42.948 --> 05:32:42.958 align:start position:0%
certainly something that we are probably
 
05:32:45.270 --> 05:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
past due creating a unified definition
 
05:32:48.708 --> 05:32:48.718 align:start position:0%
of um short-term rental big picture uh
 
05:32:50.030 --> 05:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that whenever
 
05:32:51.750 --> 05:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lawsuit whenever people are
 
05:32:53.750 --> 05:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
questioning is or is not my property a
 
05:32:55.830 --> 05:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
shortterm rental it's very clear based
 
05:32:58.948 --> 05:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
on our rsas it is or is not a short-term
 
05:33:01.070 --> 05:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
rental um so the language that we're
 
05:33:02.830 --> 05:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
proposing in this bill is that it's
 
05:33:05.470 --> 05:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
offered for a fee right you've
 
05:33:07.990 --> 05:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
got a group of units condominium
 
05:33:09.470 --> 05:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
Cooperative time share owner occupied
 
05:33:10.990 --> 05:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
residential home that's offered for a
 
05:33:12.590 --> 05:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
fee so if your friend is living with you
 
05:33:15.510 --> 05:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a short-term rental um and for
 
05:33:18.830 --> 05:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
less than 30 consecutive days in a
 
05:33:21.270 --> 05:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
building that is otherwise used as a
 
05:33:23.830 --> 05:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
residence so vacation rental could have
 
05:33:26.230 --> 05:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
the same meeting as short-term
 
05:33:29.390 --> 05:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
rental um for purposes of this bill a
 
05:33:30.868 --> 05:33:30.878 align:start position:0%
short-term rental Al is a residential
 
05:33:32.230 --> 05:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
use of the property that does not
 
05:33:33.868 --> 05:33:33.878 align:start position:0%
include a unit that is used for any
 
05:33:35.670 --> 05:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
non-residential use so for example if
 
05:33:38.350 --> 05:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
you have a mixed unit um downstairs is a
 
05:33:41.590 --> 05:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
cafe upstairs is two apartments um then
 
05:33:44.230 --> 05:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
obviously the the the unit that is
 
05:33:47.510 --> 05:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
non-residential the cafe um would not be
 
05:33:49.030 --> 05:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
considered short-term
 
05:33:52.230 --> 05:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
rental um meals and rooms tax is
 
05:33:54.110 --> 05:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
intended to Encompass the short-term
 
05:33:56.310 --> 05:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
rental obviously less than 30
 
05:33:59.310 --> 05:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
consecutive days uh and just to be super
 
05:34:02.270 --> 05:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
clear hotels motels ins tourist homes
 
05:34:04.270 --> 05:34:04.280 align:start position:0%
and other dwellings rented as short-term
 
05:34:08.510 --> 05:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
rentals um are are meant to be excluded
 
05:34:11.390 --> 05:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
um and that's a longstanding long-term
 
05:34:13.788 --> 05:34:13.798 align:start position:0%
PR practice that New Hampshire has done
 
05:34:17.310 --> 05:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
to keep hotels and motels and in out of
 
05:34:19.350 --> 05:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
the short-term rental industry because
 
05:34:21.230 --> 05:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
they have a whole different deal with
 
05:34:24.708 --> 05:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
the state for how they're taxed
 
05:34:28.910 --> 05:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
um we also have longer term rental so
 
05:34:30.910 --> 05:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
vacation or recre recreational rental
 
05:34:32.590 --> 05:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
units are rented for residential
 
05:34:35.270 --> 05:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
purposes by persons who have no other
 
05:34:37.150 --> 05:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
residents during part or all of the
 
05:34:39.788 --> 05:34:39.798 align:start position:0%
non-recreational or vacation period but
 
05:34:43.670 --> 05:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
are not short-term rentals defined above
 
05:34:46.628 --> 05:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
so being very clear we're talking about
 
05:34:48.670 --> 05:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
it's offered in a residential home for a
 
05:34:51.030 --> 05:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
fee less than 30 consecutive days that a
 
05:34:52.670 --> 05:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
building that is otherwise used as a
 
05:34:54.350 --> 05:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
residence that's the definition of
 
05:34:56.470 --> 05:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
short-term rental it's very common in
 
05:34:58.310 --> 05:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
other states we just haven't actually
 
05:35:00.510 --> 05:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
defined it uniformly in New Hampshire
 
05:35:02.030 --> 05:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
and so that's the intent of this bill to
 
05:35:05.350 --> 05:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
do just that thank you I'm happy to take
 
05:35:07.548 --> 05:35:07.558 align:start position:0%
questions okay I hate to break the bad
 
05:35:11.070 --> 05:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
news to you but it's it's worse than you
 
05:35:13.470 --> 05:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
think because when I first got into the
 
05:35:15.270 --> 05:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
sear ter rental the first thing I did is
 
05:35:17.868 --> 05:35:17.878 align:start position:0%
I I said do what what is my
 
05:35:20.270 --> 05:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and and then I looked
 
05:35:23.190 --> 05:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
up the law the statute because I knew
 
05:35:25.948 --> 05:35:25.958 align:start position:0%
how to find do that as a legislator and
 
05:35:29.230 --> 05:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
it turns out the magic number is not 30
 
05:35:32.830 --> 05:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
days the the magic number is six
 
05:35:36.590 --> 05:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
months so 6 months and a day if you have
 
05:35:40.628 --> 05:35:40.638 align:start position:0%
somebody staying in in a house for up to
 
05:35:42.510 --> 05:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
let's say a certain you know to to six
 
05:35:45.750 --> 05:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
months on the six month in a day where
 
05:35:47.868 --> 05:35:47.878 align:start position:0%
you have been charging them Hotel rents
 
05:35:49.548 --> 05:35:49.558 align:start position:0%
and you think about those motels where
 
05:35:52.548 --> 05:35:52.558 align:start position:0%
people would live in them on the sixth
 
05:35:54.670 --> 05:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
month in a day you were then were
 
05:35:58.270 --> 05:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to refund all the rooms tax you
 
05:36:02.830 --> 05:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
had collected on that person on that six
 
05:36:06.510 --> 05:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
day six plus one days and uh norce to
 
05:36:08.948 --> 05:36:08.958 align:start position:0%
say that that short-term Reynolds has
 
05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
always always been considered just like
 
05:36:15.310 --> 05:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
a hotel that's that is in our statue
 
05:36:17.350 --> 05:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's the way excuse me that is
 
05:36:21.948 --> 05:36:21.958 align:start position:0%
what Dr treats us as and uh that so when
 
05:36:23.948 --> 05:36:23.958 align:start position:0%
we our license is not a short-term
 
05:36:26.390 --> 05:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
rental license our license is rooms and
 
05:36:28.868 --> 05:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
meals and when I fill out that tax they
 
05:36:30.390 --> 05:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
ask me three questions question say did
 
05:36:34.948 --> 05:36:34.958 align:start position:0%
I serve any meals no did I rent a car it
 
05:36:37.788 --> 05:36:37.798 align:start position:0%
actually asked me did I rent the car no
 
05:36:41.230 --> 05:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
did I rent the rooms or rent the house
 
05:36:45.190 --> 05:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
yes and now I pay the exact same filing
 
05:36:48.708 --> 05:36:48.718 align:start position:0%
as everybody in the in the hotel
 
05:36:51.590 --> 05:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
restaurant business for we fill out the
 
05:36:54.868 --> 05:36:54.878 align:start position:0%
same form exact same thing so there
 
05:36:57.708 --> 05:36:57.718 align:start position:0%
really is no particular need for Dr to
 
05:37:00.070 --> 05:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
have a definition of short-term rental
 
05:37:02.270 --> 05:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
because in their minds we are no
 
05:37:04.230 --> 05:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
different than a hotel
 
05:37:08.070 --> 05:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
room believe it or not that's very
 
05:37:10.390 --> 05:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
helpful um so one of the areas that we
 
05:37:14.390 --> 05:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
currently have a conflict in rsas is um
 
05:37:17.390 --> 05:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
in the building code would you believe
 
05:37:19.910 --> 05:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
um in the building code it's not defined
 
05:37:22.270 --> 05:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
at all as to how long one needs to stay
 
05:37:23.670 --> 05:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
in order for it to be considered a
 
05:37:26.910 --> 05:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
short-term rental or just a regular
 
05:37:31.030 --> 05:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
rental um and so that becomes a problem
 
05:37:34.430 --> 05:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
for uh for occupancy and inspections as
 
05:37:35.510 --> 05:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
to whether or not you're doing a
 
05:37:37.708 --> 05:37:37.718 align:start position:0%
short-term rental or if this truly is a
 
05:37:39.270 --> 05:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
a house that's intended to be rented for
 
05:37:42.510 --> 05:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
long term um so having some kind of a
 
05:37:44.750 --> 05:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
definition would be helpful if you're
 
05:37:47.270 --> 05:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
saying that the dr's definition is six
 
05:37:50.590 --> 05:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
months and a day then that probably
 
05:37:52.230 --> 05:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
should be the full definition so that
 
05:37:55.510 --> 05:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's comprehensive across all rsas um
 
05:37:57.190 --> 05:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
because where we run into problems is
 
05:37:58.910 --> 05:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
where it's not clear and then someone
 
05:38:00.750 --> 05:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
has to have a loss suit to have a judge
 
05:38:02.270 --> 05:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
determine what's
 
05:38:05.110 --> 05:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
clear yeah I'm not sure on that because
 
05:38:08.030 --> 05:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh the issue was a life safety issue and
 
05:38:10.270 --> 05:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
yes so that's when when my fire
 
05:38:12.350 --> 05:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
department came and measured the windows
 
05:38:15.190 --> 05:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
right and and so that that every room
 
05:38:18.350 --> 05:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
had that Escape Route um that they were
 
05:38:20.390 --> 05:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
doing that as though we were an
 
05:38:22.548 --> 05:38:22.558 align:start position:0%
apartment house in other words they were
 
05:38:24.430 --> 05:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
just you they were applying that same
 
05:38:27.390 --> 05:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
regulation as any apartment facility or
 
05:38:29.868 --> 05:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
anybody you know using Asic quote
 
05:38:31.868 --> 05:38:31.878 align:start position:0%
unquote this is can be considered a
 
05:38:34.590 --> 05:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
bedroom so anyway we'll have we'll have
 
05:38:36.390 --> 05:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
more of a conversation it's ambiguous
 
05:38:39.190 --> 05:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
but but but at this point this is not
 
05:38:40.868 --> 05:38:40.878 align:start position:0%
the vehicle we want to use at this point
 
05:38:43.310 --> 05:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
we want to use your other other bill I
 
05:38:43.320 --> 05:38:45.190 align:start position:0%
we want to use your other other bill I
think

05:38:45.190 --> 05:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:38:47.590 --> 05:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
so reent
 
05:38:50.350 --> 05:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
bar I just looked at this quick but I'm
 
05:38:54.030 --> 05:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
looking at 48 A1 definition they say
 
05:38:57.150 --> 05:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
vacation rental or short-term rental is
 
05:38:59.468 --> 05:38:59.478 align:start position:0%
uh one offered for a fee in less than 30
 
05:39:02.948 --> 05:39:02.958 align:start position:0%
consecutive days and that's RSA I don't
 
05:39:04.468 --> 05:39:04.478 align:start position:0%
know what the heck it is it's a a
 
05:39:07.548 --> 05:39:07.558 align:start position:0%
universal citation what is universal
 
05:39:10.070 --> 05:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know but it just
 
05:39:12.948 --> 05:39:12.958 align:start position:0%
contradicts what you said never mind
 
05:39:15.750 --> 05:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
never mind never mind well 48 a that's
 
05:39:18.070 --> 05:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
not the RSA okay I'm just wondering what
 
05:39:20.510 --> 05:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
this is is I I you tell us what what's
 
05:39:22.910 --> 05:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
the the top of the web page this is what
 
05:39:25.468 --> 05:39:25.478 align:start position:0%
happens when you Google
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
things all right we'll figure it out
 
05:39:32.948 --> 05:39:32.958 align:start position:0%
okay any questions for representative MC
 
05:39:35.990 --> 05:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
Williams seeing seeing none thank you
 
05:39:39.390 --> 05:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:43.270 --> 05:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay he is one more time do we have any
 
05:39:44.708 --> 05:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
more bills in our committee that you're
 
05:39:52.948 --> 05:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:54.868 --> 05:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon members of the
 
05:39:56.390 --> 05:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
05:39:58.190 --> 05:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
Keen M Wong TX policy council with the
 
05:40:00.310 --> 05:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
05:40:03.548 --> 05:40:03.558 align:start position:0%
um this has heard from the uh
 
05:40:05.548 --> 05:40:05.558 align:start position:0%
conversation oh so just want to clarify
 
05:40:09.788 --> 05:40:09.798 align:start position:0%
in terms of for M&amp;R taxes uh Mr taxes is
 
05:40:11.948 --> 05:40:11.958 align:start position:0%
collected on all room occupancy the
 
05:40:15.030 --> 05:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
exemptions for the number of days is 185
 
05:40:19.590 --> 05:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
days and above so the uh that's called
 
05:40:22.230 --> 05:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
that's defined as permanent residence um
 
05:40:24.110 --> 05:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
so anything permanent residence right
 
05:40:25.590 --> 05:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
yes so anything less than permanent
 
05:40:27.788 --> 05:40:27.798 align:start position:0%
residence be called a short-term there's
 
05:40:29.868 --> 05:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
also a definition for short-term uh
 
05:40:33.548 --> 05:40:33.558 align:start position:0%
short-term uh rentals in the uh M&amp;R
 
05:40:37.070 --> 05:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
statute uh essentially it's less than
 
05:40:42.590 --> 05:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
the 185 days right um so um so when if
 
05:40:46.350 --> 05:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
the definition is changed to um 30 days
 
05:40:48.948 --> 05:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
um that would be a problem wouldn't it
 
05:40:52.510 --> 05:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
it it's the exemption for the M&amp;R is for
 
05:40:55.230 --> 05:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
permanent residents so it's doesn't take
 
05:40:56.548 --> 05:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
into account short-term rentals or
 
05:40:58.948 --> 05:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
anything like so the language in there
 
05:41:00.750 --> 05:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
so whether you define short-term rental
 
05:41:03.788 --> 05:41:03.798 align:start position:0%
as something else uh it we don't expect
 
05:41:07.070 --> 05:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
it to implicate the uh and change to the
 
05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R Revenue however um the I I I oh I
 
05:41:15.390 --> 05:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
guess I need to say that uh the
 
05:41:17.070 --> 05:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
department is does not take a position
 
05:41:18.070 --> 05:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
on this
 
05:41:21.910 --> 05:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill um and uh so but you might want to
 
05:41:23.468 --> 05:41:23.478 align:start position:0%
and say that you really don't like it
 
05:41:25.510 --> 05:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
because it could confuse people uh that
 
05:41:26.868 --> 05:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
that is one of the concerns that we
 
05:41:30.150 --> 05:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
might have is that um when when there's
 
05:41:32.430 --> 05:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
a definition for short-term rental that
 
05:41:35.070 --> 05:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
says it's 30 days or or less or or less
 
05:41:39.270 --> 05:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
than 30 days and then when somebody uh
 
05:41:39.280 --> 05:41:40.030 align:start position:0%
than 30 days and then when somebody uh
an

05:41:40.030 --> 05:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:41:43.070 --> 05:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
operator reads through our M&amp;R statute
 
05:41:45.708 --> 05:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
and says okay how is this applicable to
 
05:41:49.270 --> 05:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
the collection of taxes um essentially
 
05:41:51.750 --> 05:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really it might actually
 
05:41:53.468 --> 05:41:53.478 align:start position:0%
confuse somebody say okay why is this
 
05:41:55.310 --> 05:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
definition here short term how is this
 
05:41:57.310 --> 05:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
different from a a Perman residence of
 
05:42:00.510 --> 05:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
185 days and Beyond if the intent of the
 
05:42:04.430 --> 05:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
build is uh is more of um
 
05:42:07.510 --> 05:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
standardizing the statutes for the other
 
05:42:09.670 --> 05:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
aspects of short-term rentals maybe it
 
05:42:13.430 --> 05:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
for uh building building codes or safety
 
05:42:16.390 --> 05:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
maybe have that separate from the M&amp;R
 
05:42:20.270 --> 05:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
statute and um since um we don't if it's
 
05:42:24.868 --> 05:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
not really uh broken maybe don't
 
05:42:28.628 --> 05:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
great right uh meals in rooms yes meals
 
05:42:31.830 --> 05:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
and sorry meals and room STS apologies
 
05:42:35.070 --> 05:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
and that's RSA one those Insider terms
 
05:42:41.110 --> 05:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yes okay yep I'm here to answer any
 
05:42:43.948 --> 05:42:43.958 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
05:42:45.948 --> 05:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming to visit
 
05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:58.080 --> 05:43:03.390 align:start position:0%
 
word

05:43:03.390 --> 05:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:04.830 --> 05:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
thank you again chair and committee
 
05:43:06.270 --> 05:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
Sarah Holland New Hampshire Association
 
05:43:10.030 --> 05:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
of Realtors um again we do not feel that
 
05:43:11.830 --> 05:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill achieves what
 
05:43:14.110 --> 05:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
the sponsor intends I'll go very quickly
 
05:43:16.750 --> 05:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
section by section as we've had uh
 
05:43:18.510 --> 05:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to repeat what
 
05:43:21.830 --> 05:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
others have stated section one appears
 
05:43:23.990 --> 05:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
to only add the words that is otherwise
 
05:43:26.750 --> 05:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
used as a residence does that mean if
 
05:43:28.548 --> 05:43:28.558 align:start position:0%
the dwelling unit is not otherwise used
 
05:43:31.110 --> 05:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
as a residence that it's exempt um or is
 
05:43:32.948 --> 05:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
the intent to say short-term rentals is
 
05:43:34.910 --> 05:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
something not otherwise used for
 
05:43:37.708 --> 05:43:37.718 align:start position:0%
non-residential purposes it's confusing
 
05:43:39.830 --> 05:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
to us so it will be very likely
 
05:43:43.590 --> 05:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
confusing to others as well section two
 
05:43:46.390 --> 05:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
currently any rental under 185 days must
 
05:43:47.830 --> 05:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
pay the rooms and meals tax as
 
05:43:49.788 --> 05:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
previously stated the only reason the
 
05:43:51.868 --> 05:43:51.878 align:start position:0%
definition of a short-term rental is in
 
05:43:54.948 --> 05:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
78a is to deal with advertisements of
 
05:43:56.830 --> 05:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals having to display
 
05:43:59.070 --> 05:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
their license number so we're not
 
05:44:00.830 --> 05:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to changing the license
 
05:44:03.430 --> 05:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
requirement from 185 to 30 days we're
 
05:44:06.150 --> 05:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
not asking for the change to um but are
 
05:44:09.708 --> 05:44:09.718 align:start position:0%
not opposed section three and four the
 
05:44:11.708 --> 05:44:11.718 align:start position:0%
Realtors believe the current definition
 
05:44:14.670 --> 05:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
is clear enough certainly not aware of
 
05:44:16.990 --> 05:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
any issues which have Arisen which
 
05:44:19.510 --> 05:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
require a change generally if something
 
05:44:21.430 --> 05:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
is working and not causing issue then
 
05:44:24.590 --> 05:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
we'd like to have it stay as it is
 
05:44:26.628 --> 05:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
although we are open to discussion and
 
05:44:27.910 --> 05:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
again we are more than willing to work
 
05:44:30.190 --> 05:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
with the committee to discuss any um of
 
05:44:33.468 --> 05:44:33.478 align:start position:0%
these bills here today any
 
05:44:35.910 --> 05:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
questions I think we're all said Thank
 
05:44:37.990 --> 05:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
05:44:41.750 --> 05:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
you and uh the blue sheet we don't have
 
05:44:43.468 --> 05:44:43.478 align:start position:0%
any we're all set with the blue sheet so
 
05:44:46.150 --> 05:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
I will close the public
 
05:44:46.160 --> 05:44:48.590 align:start position:0%
I will close the public
hearing

05:44:48.590 --> 05:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:44:48.600 --> 05:44:52.150 align:start position:0%
hearing
and

05:44:52.150 --> 05:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:56.868 --> 05:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
so Tuesday Tuesday Yeah Tuesday Tuesday
 
05:44:58.708 --> 05:44:58.718 align:start position:0%
Tuesday Yeah Tuesday we're going to meet
 
05:45:01.430 --> 05:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
a small room so you get to for you
 
05:45:03.350 --> 05:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
newbies get to see what it was like in
 
05:45:05.430 --> 05:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
the old days back in the old days back
 
05:45:08.190 --> 05:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:11.310 --> 05:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
days no you
 
05:45:15.190 --> 05:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
know I my very first term I was on
 
05:45:18.510 --> 05:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
science sci-fi as I called it and yes I
 
05:45:20.430 --> 05:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
was up on the fourth floor I was up
 
05:45:22.628 --> 05:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
there and that and that was right after
 
05:45:24.628 --> 05:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
that that's when the burn when the fire
 
05:45:28.548 --> 05:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
occurred so my my plaque my old plaque
 
05:45:57.788 --> 05:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:57.798 --> 05:46:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
on
