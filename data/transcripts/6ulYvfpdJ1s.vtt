00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
right now and my husband and Sons are in
 
00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
the house and may come through at some
 
00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:49.259 align:start position:0%
point later
 
00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:51.419 align:start position:0%
representative Chase
 
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
good morning sorry about that I am here
 
00:07:57.529 --> 00:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
home alone in Rollinsford
 
00:07:59.809 --> 00:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
the attendance 21-0
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
noting that one person does have a
 
00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:08.809 align:start position:0%
noting that one person does have a
substitute

00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
substitute
 
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:10.790 align:start position:0%
yes having
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.230 align:start position:0%
yes having
[Music]

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
having taken the role uh we'll begin our
 
00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:16.259 align:start position:0%
session this morning we'll go through
 
00:08:16.259 --> 00:08:18.170 align:start position:0%
session this morning we'll go through
the

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
the matters that we have pending today
 
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
in order and we'll begin with House Bill
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
82 an act relative to amending a
 
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
conservation easement between the state
 
00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
and a landowner
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative representative Sylvia
 
00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
I understand that representative Burch
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
has an amendment but I would move itl
 
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.589 align:start position:0%
has an amendment but I would move itl
um

00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
I believe this involves a constitutional
 
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.290 align:start position:0%
I believe this involves a constitutional
interest

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:47.300 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
issue of contracts and I don't think we
 
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
can study our way out of that but I'd
 
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
move IPL with the chairman would accept
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
there's a motion to uh to recommend
 
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate is that
 
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:09.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
by uh representative Alexander
 
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:15.140 align:start position:0%
and you want to address your emotion
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative sovia more than you
 
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
already have
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
great uh this is a very complex issue
 
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
and essentially when you boil it down
 
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.790 align:start position:0%
and essentially when you boil it down
these

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
easements are contracts and and often
 
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
contracts with people who have passed
 
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.070 align:start position:0%
contracts with people who have passed
and

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
our our constitution our first article
 
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.490 align:start position:0%
our our constitution our first article
second

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
um supports the
 
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
concept of contracts and even if this is
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
a simple study committee I think it's a
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
study committee with a dead end and I
 
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
believe that uh
 
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit too much to overcome
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
so um yeah so that's where I'm going
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
um I obviously opposed that motion and
 
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
should that motion not uh succeed I
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
would be moving an amendment that
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
narrows the uh scope of the study
 
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
committee uh to the particular statute
 
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
that's blocking a solution to this case
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
and to some other uh similar easements
 
00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:41.459 align:start position:0%
all the uh it seems like most of the
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
parties agree that the situation with
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
some very old easements under a very
 
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
specific statute
 
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.470 align:start position:0%
specific statute
um

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
is working in Injustice and I would hope
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
that this committee would take a stand
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
in favor of the little guy in favor of
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
the citizen in favor of the farmer as
 
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh government bureaucracies
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
and the like uh it's kind of a freedom
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
issue for my friends across the aisle
 
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
um and uh basically the idea of looking
 
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
at reforming a statute is what the
 
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:26.180 align:start position:0%
legislature does that is our business
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
and this study committee is supported by
 
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office the study
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
committee is supported by the uh the
 
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:37.820 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of
 
00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:42.899 align:start position:0%
Agriculture Sean Jasper this uh the the
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
head of the charitable trust division
 
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
came and told us that he felt this
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
specific statute needed to be worked on
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't support too many study
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
committees but I'm even willing to to be
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
on the study committee uh as needs be so
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
I would urge this group to
 
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.030 align:start position:0%
I would urge this group to
um

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
not vote uh to close our ears to the
 
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
pleas of our small farmers and our
 
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
citizens uh reject the itl so another
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
chairman I would just say that we don't
 
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
really need a bill to do a study
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
committee we can an ad hoc committee can
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
be formed and it can be done we don't
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
need to formally create a study
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
committee for this if it's if it's that
 
00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:41.750 align:start position:0%
committee for this if it's if it's that
important

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I
 
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
it's just like you humbly disagree with
 
00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:53.339 align:start position:0%
the member from Belmont's uh
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
constitutional theory in fact if
 
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:56.700 align:start position:0%
anything uh
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
if anything regulating and enforcing
 
00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:01.019 align:start position:0%
contracts is one of the most important
 
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:02.540 align:start position:0%
things to cover government government
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
does I did those have no jurisdictions
 
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
over contracts is
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
not something that I would I would agree
 
00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
with and then anyway in this case um
 
00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
if that if there is indeed a well first
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
of all we're only dealing there's only
 
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
also but if indeed there is a
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional impediment to doing
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
anything about these old easements which
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
were the emphasis for the bill
 
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.750 align:start position:0%
were the emphasis for the bill
um

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
study committee can get together a few
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
times and I think a formal study
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
committee would have uh more stature uh
 
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
more uh you probably have probably have
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
a higher priority on the various experts
 
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
time so if indeed there is a
 
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
constitutional impediment to which I
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
don't believe a study committee is a
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
good way to uh to look in look into that
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
but I think
 
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
I think the study committee has a much
 
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
broader scope than that so I think it's
 
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.550 align:start position:0%
broader scope than that so I think it's
a

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:55.019 align:start position:0%
I think it's a perfectly uh I think it's
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
a perfectly I think it's a very useful
 
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
exercise and so I think we should go
 
00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
forward with it thanks
 
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:04.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.069 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
I realize I'm I'm a visitor here but I'm
 
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
looking at the underlying Bill and I'm
 
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
confused by the debate because I don't
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
see a study committee
 
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
it it I I think that if the Ito motion
 
00:14:21.769 --> 00:14:21.779 align:start position:0%
is defeated representative Burge intends
 
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
to offer an amendment uh thank you
 
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:26.459 align:start position:0%
further Edward sure without the
 
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:32.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't think we're the I don't
 
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
think the intention is to debate the
 
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019 align:start position:0%
amendment I think it was offered by
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative birch as his potential
 
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
yes representative McLean uh yes thank
 
00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:53.339 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I agree with representative
 
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
rights I I do think there is some
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
inconsistency with some of the new
 
00:14:59.930 --> 00:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
easements in the old Eagles so there's
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
an opportunity here if an amendment were
 
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
to be offered however I don't think we
 
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
need the committee
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
um I I would actually favor emotion of
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
retention and I think this is something
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
that we could do within uh the committee
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
ourselves so that's that's what I would
 
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.889 align:start position:0%
ourselves so that's that's what I would
favor

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
so as an alternative to
 
00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
as an alternative the itl you'd be
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
retention I've been looking for
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
retention as an alternative
 
00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:31.019 align:start position:0%
um but that's not promotion on the floor
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
right now thank you and representative
 
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
rice did you have your hand up I did I
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
was that was what I was going to say was
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
why can't we just retain it and work on
 
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
it in the committee and rather than
 
00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
and representative Birch uh if if that's
 
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
what happens I can certainly live with
 
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.629 align:start position:0%
what happens I can certainly live with
that

00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:55.310 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320 align:start position:0%

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.950 align:start position:0%

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
ahead representative Birch yes as I
 
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
indicated uh at an earlier hearing the
 
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
amendment uh makes it clear that this
 
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.250 align:start position:0%
amendment uh makes it clear that this
um

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:45.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh Bill
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
affects claims by or against a
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
government unit so we've covered it in
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
both directions basically whether the
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
government unit is a plaintiff or a
 
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.730 align:start position:0%
government unit is a plaintiff or a
defendant

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
defendant
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
we would not have uh secrecy along the
 
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
lines of this bill so it's a small
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
Amendment but that's what it
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
has been suggestive and I think it's a
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.169 --> 00:22:26.179 align:start position:0%
saying that are you ready to go
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
yeah we're voting on the amendment
 
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.409 --> 00:22:39.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.419 --> 00:22:43.490 align:start position:0%

00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
so we are recommending not to pass as
 
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
amended at house level 83 and without
 
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
next next bill is House Bill 108 an act
 
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
relative to minutes and decisions and
 
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.700 align:start position:0%

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
motion made by McLean seconded by
 
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
representative wolfer and if you want to
 
00:27:47.049 --> 00:27:47.059 align:start position:0%
address your motion
 
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
just quickly um I I think that this is a
 
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
minor burden
 
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
um we've heard testimony in the past of
 
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh a tendency to have sealed minutes
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
accumulate over time and there's really
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
nothing that uh goes back and provides a
 
00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:06.049 align:start position:0%
nothing that uh goes back and provides a
review

00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:06.059 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
um this is a minor burden where you
 
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
would go and as you decide to to seal
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
the minutes from a non-public session
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
and keep a list
 
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
um it'll just make it easier if you want
 
00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:18.299 align:start position:0%
to go back and do some cleanup or some
 
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
periodic review of that
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
um to be able to do that so I think I
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
think it's a real game for transparency
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%

I think I would like to make a motion if
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
I could to
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
obtain that bill
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
it provides I think that's seconded by
 
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
in England also segmented by
 
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.310 align:start position:0%

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
I think this provides a real opportunity
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
for estate planning if we heard the
 
00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
testimony that this is something that's
 
00:34:00.649 --> 00:34:00.659 align:start position:0%
been adopted in a number of other states
 
00:34:03.169 --> 00:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
through the other states and to provide
 
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
an effective estate planning tool for a
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
lot of people
 
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
their only asset enlightens their house
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
they might want to be able to transfer
 
00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
without having to do complex estate

appointment

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
00:34:18.169 --> 00:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
but but I discovered after we had the
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
hearing was that this has another impact
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's an impact of our registry of
 
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
deeds that's traditionally in the
 
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
registry of dates you either have a
 
00:34:28.849 --> 00:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
grant or a grantee
 
00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
in this particular case
 
00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
you really don't have green tea until
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
The Grand Tour dies and this is going to
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
require the call of the bill seems
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
simple in terms of what it's going to do
 
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
between one person and another
 
00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:47.419 align:start position:0%
it has some effect on government
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
operates and I think that that needs to
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
be studied addressed before we put this
 
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
into effect I'm just asked the committee
 
00:34:59.089 --> 00:34:59.099 align:start position:0%
if they would be willing to retain the
 
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660 align:start position:0%

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%

00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh sure just briefly um this bill is
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
really pretty unworkable
 
00:37:59.040 --> 00:37:59.710 align:start position:0%
really pretty unworkable
um

00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
essentially it would if it were able to
 
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:05.339 align:start position:0%
be applied it would
 
00:38:08.089 --> 00:38:08.099 align:start position:0%
restrict New Hampshire companies and as
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to perhaps the offenders that
 
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.250 align:start position:0%
opposed to perhaps the offenders that
are

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
more desired to be affected so it just
 
00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:20.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon
 
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair well there's a uh
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
very fundamental First Amendment issue
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
and that the First Amendment
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
freedom to press also covers the right
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
not to use your press publish uh publish
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
that material you find objectionable and
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
also um
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
the business model of these social
 
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
networks is to provide
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
people with content which they want to
 
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
read so they can label Shadow banding
 
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
but that's pretty much you do is they
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
preference you distribute things a lot
 
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
of people want to see as opposed to
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
stuff that nobody wants to see and
 
00:38:58.849 --> 00:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
that's um there's that are their
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
fundamental business models so if we
 
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
go with the shadow banding unfortunately
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
is part of it because and um
 
00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:08.099 align:start position:0%
also I think the barrier to entry are
 
00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
probably not quite as large as people
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
think to someone if a
 
00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:14.579 align:start position:0%
um these platforms come and go so the
 
00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
ones that there is so there's like a
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
free market
 
00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
incentive to be like as inclusive as
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
possible so I
 
00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:23.339 align:start position:0%
think this is a
 
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
and also of course this is a federal
 
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
issue anyways this is a bad bill so I
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%

pollution of a drinking water supply of

the financially responsible for certain
 
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
consequences of that pollution
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative McLean you have a motion
 
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess thank you Mr chair Mr chair
 
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
um I move off to pass and offer
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
and is there a second to that I would
 
00:42:34.089 --> 00:42:34.099 align:start position:0%
second that Mr Chair
 
00:42:39.069 --> 00:42:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
um uh even though uh Blitz field is in
 
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
my district
 
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
um I was not an original co-sponsor on
 
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
this legislation I think what changed my
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
mind about this legislation is right
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
after the election I got a letter from
 
00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.270 align:start position:0%
after the election I got a letter from
uh

00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
basically stating that they were filing
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
a rape case with the puc for over 20
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
increase you know for the people in
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
Litchfield and it really made me realize
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
that although they had had no
 
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
involvement in bringing this to Bear
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
they were going to be bearing the
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
consequences of that for 10 20 30 years
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
and so I think that there is some Merit
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
to the legislation
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
um there were concerns in the original
 
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.170 align:start position:0%
um there were concerns in the original
legislation

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
um as discussed uh by Des really wanting
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
to clarify the nature of the hookup
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
preferring that the city water and that
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
the Standalone units be more a temporary
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
thing until we could go in that
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
direction and also fears that The
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
Five-Year compensation
 
00:43:49.609 --> 00:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
would be a barrier to compliance so what
 
00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:51.380 align:start position:0%
the amendment does it just basically
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
clarifies that we want to go forward
 
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:56.339 align:start position:0%
with the city hook up when possible and
 
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
it cuts to five years back to two and so
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's basically the fundamental content
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
so we're actually I think addressing the
 
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
amendment right now correct and another
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
see it
 
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
but then I guess we'll be voting on the
 
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
amendment as offered by
 
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:29.220 align:start position:0%

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
after the amendment
 
00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
21-0 so now we are back to the

uh thank you Mr chairman
um

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
the amendment makes this just slightly
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
better but uh
 
00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
I think the bill overall is is not very
 
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
well written
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
um I think it's
 
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
people kind of at the mercy of the
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner is stated so
 
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there's enough details
 
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
in the language that sets out all of the
 
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.050 align:start position:0%
in the language that sets out all of the
uh

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
the uh remedies so I'm going to be
 
00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339 align:start position:0%
voting against the bill although you
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
know it's a great idea but I don't think
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
it really delivers what it
 
00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
ought to like good water
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and McLean thank you Mr chair
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
um I I understand uh representative
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
Sylvia is concerned about the Des
 
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner but we did hear his
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
testimony that there is um arrival
 
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
appeal to the waste management Council
 
00:47:26.329 --> 00:47:26.339 align:start position:0%
and then a further appeal available to
 
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court so there
 
00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
is in my opinion still the preservation
 
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
of due process with this building
 
00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
of due process with this building
foreign

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:35.590 align:start position:0%

00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:53.650 align:start position:0%
foreign
[Music]

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:53.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
actual damage it this bill doesn't
 
00:47:58.130 --> 00:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
require any actual damages it's all
 
00:48:02.329 --> 00:48:02.339 align:start position:0%
prospective the potential penalties that
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
it will be paid are unlimited because of
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
the time frame from these states will
 
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
work out might be Unlimited
 
00:48:10.609 --> 00:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
and the cost of compliance might be
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
are you thinking which building
 
00:48:23.809 --> 00:48:23.819 align:start position:0%
no no this is not the medical honoring
 
00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:24.839 align:start position:0%
though I'm speaking to the wrong
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
building Mr chair yes so I just I just
 
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that this is this is
 
00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:33.980 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a very clear
 
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
circumscribed remedy this is just a lot
 
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:42.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
yes as I understand this bill
 
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
well it talks about consequences the
 
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
title not damages so the word
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
disappeared the text of the bills think
 
00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
the idea of this bill is to uh
 
00:48:58.550 --> 00:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
um it's enable is to make it a make it
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
harder is is to make it uh to encourage
 
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
uh all the parties to take competitive
 
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
action so the uh the person for the
 
00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
polluters will have to take preventive
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
action and that might uh that should
 
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
save them save them money in the long
 
00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
run and save the effective people uh of
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
the suffering because
 
00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.230 align:start position:0%
the suffering because
um

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
if you filter the water supply or
 
00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
otherwise mitigated and if you stop the
 
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
pollution then that uh that's a better
 
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
solution than just letting the pollution
 
00:49:28.609 --> 00:49:28.619 align:start position:0%
go unabated and no preventive action and
 
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
then people uh
 
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
people have to suffer uh have to suffer
 
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
the damages and then go through the
 
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
whole court process so I think this is
 
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh this is good because it uh it makes
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
the problem but
 
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
prevents a big problem from becoming
 
00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
huge so thanks yes I think this is a
 
00:49:46.859 --> 00:49:47.870 align:start position:0%
huge so thanks yes I think this is a
preventative

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
preventative
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
these are discourages preventive
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
measures so that I think that makes it a
 
00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
you know their discussion
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%

00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
no Alexander representative Alexander
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.030 align:start position:0%
excuse me
and

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:20.579 align:start position:0%
you want to address you representative
 
00:53:20.579 --> 00:53:21.950 align:start position:0%
you want to address you representative
certainly

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.510 align:start position:0%
certainly
um

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:26.220 align:start position:0%
while we don't call this rent control it
 
00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:28.140 align:start position:0%
is rent control it's got to start
 
00:53:31.849 --> 00:53:31.859 align:start position:0%
somewhere and uh the first place to
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
start is uh
 
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:35.170 align:start position:0%
start is uh
dictating

00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:35.180 align:start position:0%
dictating
 
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
terms of renewals of lease
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
so this is step one if we can go this
 
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
I think the system as we have it now is
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
well it's not exactly great it uh it
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
causes rinse to be higher this would
 
00:53:59.329 --> 00:53:59.339 align:start position:0%
just increase that problem in when we
 
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
have affordable housing issued
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
uh these sorts of things do not help so
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm at
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman so um I am uh
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
speaking against the itl motion
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
um in my opinion this is in no way shape
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
or form rent uh control all it is is
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
rent notification um it's a very simple
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
Bill If a landlord can absolutely
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
increase rent as much as he or she sees
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
fit uh just with the requirement of
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
adequate uh notification
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
um I I think that saying the system
 
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
isn't great as an understatement I
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
throughout my two terms we heard enough
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
personal testimony and from others of
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
people whose rent increased astronomical
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
amounts um with only having 30 days to
 
00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:55.740 align:start position:0%
either find that amount of money or
 
00:54:58.730 --> 00:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
Another Place uh to live I think that we
 
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
absolutely need to give Granite Staters
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
more time I I believe that uh this bill
 
00:55:06.049 --> 00:55:06.059 align:start position:0%
is fair 60 days that exceeds five
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
percent or 90 days that exceeds eight
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
percent or more um so I think it's a
 
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
very fair bill and I urge um my
 
00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:14.099 align:start position:0%
colleagues to vote this motion down to
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
another one can be offered thank you Mr
 
00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:17.470 align:start position:0%
another one can be offered thank you Mr
chairman

00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander
 
00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
Echo representative Sylvia's points
 
00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
um this is I believe a step towards rent
 
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
control I believe that 30 days is
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
adequate about her notice
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
um while I'm sympathetic in an advocate
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
um for more housing in the housing
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
crisis I believe that
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
um this the solution to that is on the
 
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
supply side and not further regulation
 
00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
on our landlords who are already
 
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
experiencing huge amounts of regulations
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
especially during the cobit campaign so
 
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
um we need to vote this down thank you
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
and representative Morgan
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair I'll just
 
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
say that the uh rental housing market
 
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire is very very
 
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
different from what we learned in econ
 
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
101 so the you know
 
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
the supply and demand courage are not
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
like neatly processing each other at a
 
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:13.140 align:start position:0%
45 degree angles so uh I think
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's I mean this is not rent control and
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
it's certainly very far back to what was
 
00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:18.530 align:start position:0%
it's certainly very far back to what was
uh

00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:21.049 --> 00:56:21.059 align:start position:0%
instituted in New York City 75 years ago
 
00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
in which like doesn't really exist
 
00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
anymore so um
 
00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
I think we need to we need we need at
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
least some sort of control over it and
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
this is just a very very basic thing
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
with uh lets the tenant know what the uh
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
what the cost is going to be because
 
00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
this is very very different from an
 
00:56:41.569 --> 00:56:41.579 align:start position:0%
Ideal Market you know the two sides of
 
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
Mark could have
 
00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:45.740 align:start position:0%
you know there's a severe shortage of
 
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
rental housing and uh there's also like
 
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
a severe power imbalance between the two
 
00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
sides and you certainly
 
00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
this is one of many areas where how they
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
approach commercial leases is totally
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
different than part of the reason for
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
that is well first of all there's
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
not a shortage of commercial housing but
 
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
also like the uh you know the players
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
are you know they're playing against
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
people their own size you know in that
 
00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:11.339 align:start position:0%
case the tenants have as much power as
 
00:57:13.849 --> 00:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
the landlord sometimes more so this is
 
00:57:16.849 --> 00:57:16.859 align:start position:0%
uh this is just a simple thing to level
 
00:57:18.849 --> 00:57:18.859 align:start position:0%
the playing field you know this is a
 
00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:21.059 align:start position:0%
residence housing market it's not like
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
we have an econ 101 and the Holy Show
 
00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
Supply you know that's uh
 
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
that's a whole separate issue which is
 
00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of this bill and that's
 
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh I believe beyond the scope of this
 
00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
committee but uh I don't think passing
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
is I don't think I don't think idealing
 
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to make anybody rush
 
00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:40.700 align:start position:0%
out and build more uh rental housing so
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote against cipl and
 
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
hopefully get past the bill thanks
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wolper thank
 
00:57:51.049 --> 00:57:51.059 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh Mr chairman one thing
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
we very law and clear is that uh the
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
rental market is tight and expensive
 
00:57:59.329 --> 00:57:59.339 align:start position:0%
mostly because of regulations and every
 
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
regulation that we add increases the
 
00:58:04.609 --> 00:58:04.619 align:start position:0%
cost decreases the availability and
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
makes the housing prices worse so I'm
 
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%

so

01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
I sponsored a bill just about identical
 
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
to this last year
 
01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:10.140 align:start position:0%
uh my opinion that we are the owners
 
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
of what happens during collected by
 
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
now which side which is the taxpayer
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
pays the taxpayers should know be able
 
01:01:21.049 --> 01:01:21.059 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:01:23.089 --> 01:01:23.099 align:start position:0%
what's going on during these adult
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
patients so I was appalled with my
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
School board chairman and I was there at
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
my church one night and I asked him he
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
said oh I can't talk to you about what
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
we're negotiating I can't tell you
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
well it's excluded because we're doing
 
01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
in the darkness negotiation
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
and now it's Paul I think it's a great
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
deal it's transparent it's an effect in
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
many states
 
01:01:53.329 --> 01:01:53.339 align:start position:0%
what some states have partial open and
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
the modern states have totally open this
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
is to us
 
01:01:59.930 --> 01:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
protect you to give the boards an
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to develop your strategy or
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
whatever in private
 
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to the action
 
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
negotiations that should be in public
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
and we've heard from a testament
 
01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
National people who are involved in
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
National negotiations such as if there's
 
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
a problem when that occurs
 
01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:21.589 align:start position:0%
a problem when that occurs
questions

01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
Representatives representative Macbeth
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair
 
01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
um despite my respect for some of the
 
01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor and my colleagues um I
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
can't support the motion ought to pass I
 
01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
I understand that this bill you know the
 
01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
intent is to create transparency
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
although I feel like it it really will
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
do the opposite and it'll
 
01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
um be detrimental to the um collective
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
bargaining process and because I think
 
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
it's going to increase
 
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
um maybe create some posturing and a
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
lack of Candor so I I urge my colleagues
 
01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
to vote against the um odd to pass
 
01:02:59.569 --> 01:02:59.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
seeing no one we do have a motion uh to
 
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
make the recommendation of ought to pass
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
and Mr clerk can you call a roll
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%

um the drug court program already
 
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
provides for the services
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
um mentioned in this bill so it allows

the offender to participate in social
 
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720 align:start position:0%

um for 18 to 24 months
 
01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.170 align:start position:0%
um for 18 to 24 months
um

01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
while the person is in the program and
 
01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.190 align:start position:0%

01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:17.700 align:start position:0%
we need to also think about the cost
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill right now the present drug
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
court is able to
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
Bill the participants medical insurance
 
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
and medical insurance covers about 90
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
percent of the cost of the program so
 
01:06:37.849 --> 01:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:40.260 align:start position:0%

01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
I was building 216 and that relative to
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
public notice of and access to meetings
 
01:08:57.769 --> 01:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
of the right to know representative
 
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
Smith had a question oh I'm sorry thank
 
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I do have a question about
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
this bill as
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
um the news has been percolating through
 
01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
the legislature that the um
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
speaker is working on adjusting our
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
calendar and changing our deadlines
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
so that we can
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
compact a time when we'll all be
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
together closer to the end of March and
 
01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
the beginning of April because of that
 
01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
the immediate urgency to vote on bills
 
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
is somewhat lessened we have an
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
amendment that has not yet come back
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
from OLS on this bill so I wonder if you
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
would consider
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
just delaying this and to put it perhaps
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
on the calendar for next week when we
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
will be um again uh executing bills and
 
01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
that I don't think would add an undue
 
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
burden since it's only 10 12 and we've
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
already taken 12 votes so we're moving
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
right along
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
are you talking about House Bill 216
 
01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:28.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any objection If We
 
01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
Hold that to our next Executive Center
 
01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
we are planning to have the executive
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
session next uh Wednesday a week from
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
why why don't uh
 
01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:50.780 align:start position:0%
we'll hold off acting on House Bill 216.
 
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
in order to record uh representative
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
Smith the opportunity to get her
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment together
 
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
and we'll act on it
 
01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
a plan to act on it next Wednesday
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
Hospital 227 that relative to
 
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.410 align:start position:0%
Hospital 227 that relative to
termination

01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:14.420 align:start position:0%
termination
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
at the expiration of the Tennessee or
 
01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
and I would think the most
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
not to pass and would offer
 
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:38.650 align:start position:0%
not to pass and would offer
McLean

01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:38.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
his Amendment
 
01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:58.450 align:start position:0%
his Amendment
2021-0361h

01:11:58.450 --> 01:11:58.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
made any representations with regard to
 
01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:07.790 align:start position:0%
made any representations with regard to
uh

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:11.229 --> 01:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
to knowing it very supporting the bill
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
I'm completely enacted I didn't believe
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
that Elliott supported or did not object
 
01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:20.219 align:start position:0%
to the amendment that was proposing but
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
he has never supported the bill
 
01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that the amendment
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh
 
01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
would have been the bill
 
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't support that as well he's my
 
01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
good friend I just want to make it clear
 
01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
that I'm not speaking for him at all
 
01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:41.689 align:start position:0%
that I'm not speaking for him at all
so

01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:41.699 --> 01:12:44.090 align:start position:0%
so
the

01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.630 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
is indicate that if you are a landlord
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
and enter into a lease agreement that
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
you would be able to terminate at least
 
01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
at the end of the term of the lease
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
without having to show that there was
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.159 --> 01:13:18.410 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
because at least is in fact a contract
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
and so you enter into that contract
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
who are only agree
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
the landlord and the senator only agree
 
01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
that they would have concession the
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
tenant could have possession of that
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
property before the turn of the least
 
01:13:38.689 --> 01:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
and in many cases there is good reason
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
good cause for people to expect people
 
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
to leave at the turn at the end of the
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
turn of the lease
 
01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
another current law it just doesn't
 
01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:52.669 align:start position:0%
another current law it just doesn't
apply

01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
apply
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
so you may decide that you want to rent
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
your property
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
on newfound Lake and you wanted to live
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
for a year but then you have other plans
 
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year right now just
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
signing a lease and saying to turn this
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
a year isn't sufficient in order for
 
01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
that to ask that person to leave at the
 
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
end of the year you have to show that
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's other good cause other than for
 
01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.430 align:start position:0%
there's other good cause other than for
instance

01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:21.260 align:start position:0%
so it makes sense I believe to
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
enforce the terms of the country
 
01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
I think that that was the sponsorship
 
01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
I think it has some unintended
 
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
consequence and that is
 
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
very common for landlords
 
01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:35.870 align:start position:0%
very common for landlords
to

01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
enter into a one-year lease and then
 
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
allow people to hold
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
so you may have somebody that enters
 
01:14:45.169 --> 01:14:45.179 align:start position:0%
into a one-year lease that release isn't
 
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
renewed and they're there for six years
 
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
well if that's the case
 
01:14:52.610 --> 01:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
the way that the original bill was
 
01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
written somebody can just terminate the
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
lease at the end of
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
terminate at least any time because the
 
01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
the term of the lease is expired so six
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
years later you wouldn't have to show
 
01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
cause you could just terminate the lease
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that's fair uh
 
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
certainly not fair
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
so the amount what the amendment does is
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
say yeah you can terminate the lease but
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
you have to do it uh
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh you have to provide notice to the
 
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
tenant before the lease term expires so
 
01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
if you enter into a one-year lease you
 
01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
would have to give the tenant 30 days
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
notice in advance that you're not going
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
to renew the lease and that you would
 
01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:33.620 align:start position:0%
like them to vacation
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
and I think that that is a is reasonable
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
a reasonable expectation and I think it
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
makes the bill certainly more acceptable
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
and so I would
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
encourage people to support the
 
01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.850 align:start position:0%
encourage people to support the
amendment

01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:51.860 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
makes the bill better in any event
 
01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
regardless of how you feel but I would
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
also ask you to support the
 
01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:02.699 --> 01:16:04.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the question
 
01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify the details of the
 
01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:10.910 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify the details of the
amendment

01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I understand that the landlord would
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
have to give the 30-day notice for uh
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
for vacating the unit then would after
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
that 12-year mark would it just continue
 
01:16:24.169 --> 01:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
out of 30 days or would it be extend for
 
01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
another year and then the 30 days would
 
01:16:28.729 --> 01:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
start again or is it just on a month by
 
01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:32.060 align:start position:0%
month after that initial lease period no
 
01:16:36.729 --> 01:16:36.739 align:start position:0%
uh if you enter into the written lease
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
basically if you don't renew the lease
 
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
if you don't renew the lease
 
01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:46.140 align:start position:0%
then all bets are off then you have to
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
prove then you have to go back and you
 
01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
have to prove a good cause for eviction
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
so and this has a I think the amendment
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
will have a positive effect because
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
right now so many landlords
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
very professionally Awards
 
01:17:03.649 --> 01:17:03.659 align:start position:0%
have people redo their lease every year
 
01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
let's do a new release renew every year
 
01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
but the fact is that lots of landlords
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
aren't professional landlords and what
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
they do is a one-year lease that's very
 
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
typical to do a one-year lease and then
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh that's it and then the tenant just
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
stays there because the tenant has
 
01:17:22.729 --> 01:17:22.739 align:start position:0%
proven to be a good tenant they want
 
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
them to stay there
 
01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
I think if you put this amendment into
 
01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
effect it'll have the effect of
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
encouraging landlords to renew their
 
01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
lease every year which is a much better
 
01:17:37.729 --> 01:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
practice and a much better practice for
 
01:17:37.739 --> 01:17:38.689 align:start position:0%
practice and a much better practice for
everyone

01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
but the fact is if you let your lease
 
01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.649 align:start position:0%
but the fact is if you let your lease
spy

01:17:42.649 --> 01:17:42.659 align:start position:0%
spy
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
at least turns five
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
then after that you have to prove a good
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.169 --> 01:18:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I had a stuck Mount thank you
 
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
very much for your response appreciate
 
01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:07.669 align:start position:0%
very much for your response appreciate
it

01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative e Lorenzo thank you Mr
 
01:18:13.729 --> 01:18:13.739 align:start position:0%
chair I have a question for you so once
 
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
the um 30-day notice is sent to the
 
01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:17.570 align:start position:0%
the um 30-day notice is sent to the
tenant

01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
tenant
 
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
does the landlord then have to take the
 
01:18:23.149 --> 01:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
tenant to court to evict them I I think
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's a thank you that's a really good
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
question and a very good point because
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
you still have to go there's no way you
 
01:18:31.729 --> 01:18:31.739 align:start position:0%
you don't just kick somebody out they
 
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
still have to take them to court so if
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
they don't leave the premises at the end
 
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
of the lease period they still have to
 
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
go through the normal eviction process
 
01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:46.209 align:start position:0%
go through the normal eviction process
and

01:18:46.209 --> 01:18:46.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
and then and that's what the whole issue
 
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
is about and that is what standard is
 
01:18:53.689 --> 01:18:53.699 align:start position:0%
the court going to apply and in this
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
particular case this would change the
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
law to say that it would have a fixed
 
01:18:59.570 --> 01:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
term on your lease
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
you a landlord gets to evict a tenant at
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
the end of the term of that lease and it
 
01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense because
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
people enter into agreements and they
 
01:19:11.689 --> 01:19:11.699 align:start position:0%
enter into the lease and then they find
 
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
out their tenant is a lousy tenant
 
01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:15.050 align:start position:0%
out their tenant is a lousy tenant
frankly

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
they don't keep the place clean you know
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
I could tell you as a judge you hear
 
01:19:21.169 --> 01:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
these stories all the time about they
 
01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
have a non-smoking apartment and the
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
people are smoking in it but they could
 
01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
never catch them smoking in it but they
 
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
know they are because of the smell in it
 
01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
and they want them out at the end of the
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
least term and it makes sense to give
 
01:19:35.689 --> 01:19:35.699 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity if they have a
 
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
defined lease in order to be able to get
 
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
them out but then you go to court and
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
and that Court you still have to prove
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
that it's the end of the lease term
 
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
and that you have a right to have them
 
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
out and then the court has discretion to
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
give the tenants up to 90 days in order
 
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
to vacate the premises
 
01:19:58.370 --> 01:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
and it's very typical for judges to give
 
01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
a reasonable period of time not uncommon
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
for 30 days for people to vacate even
 
01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:19.070 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
you want to address your motion yeah
 
01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:25:57.530 --> 01:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
um I have a lot of Sympathy for the
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
concerns around feedback but um I think
 
01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
that the three years is adequate
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
especially given the fact that this bill
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
really doesn't change the time outwards
 
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
the clock starts ticking which is at the
 
01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
point of reasonable Discovery so even if
 
01:26:19.129 --> 01:26:19.139 align:start position:0%
you're 20 or 25 years out or if there's
 
01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
new information brought to bear that
 
01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
would alter that then the the clock
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
basically starts again because that's
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
when this new information is discovered
 
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
so I really don't see uh the need and in
 
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
addition what it does is it creates a
 
01:26:40.129 --> 01:26:40.139 align:start position:0%
special cargo for uh pfas itself and so
 
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
I think as we go down the road and we
 
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
discover other substances I can see the
 
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
creation of a patchwork in the future
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
where we're going to be coming back
 
01:26:50.689 --> 01:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
let's add this and it's going to be this
 
01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
not to that much so I think really for
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
me the central point is the clock starts
 
01:26:58.370 --> 01:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
ticking at the point of reasonable
 
01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
Discovery that's unchanged I don't think
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is necessary and I'm
 
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative page
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
um I I would impose the motion for itl
 
01:27:16.729 --> 01:27:16.739 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons I think this is
 
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
a law that catches up with the science
 
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
as we know the law moves slowly I think
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
this is a particularly relevant in this
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
case because we know how difficult it is
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
to uh prove toxic tort cases as we heard
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
testimony on that point
 
01:27:36.010 --> 01:27:36.020 align:start position:0%
um I think in terms of the carve out
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
issue this makes sense with pfas because
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
this is a bunch of them this is in a
 
01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
suite of emerging contaminants these are
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
things that the science is learning
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
about in the context of pfas these are
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
the the um negative health effects such
 
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.010 align:start position:0%
the the um negative health effects such
as

01:27:55.010 --> 01:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
low infant birth weights asthma
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
increased cancer rates and then
 
01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.370 align:start position:0%
increased cancer rates and then
particularly

01:28:00.370 --> 01:28:00.380 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
impactful on children
 
01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
are latent to develop so it makes sense
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
that we would extend the normal what
 
01:28:10.129 --> 01:28:10.139 align:start position:0%
would we would consider a typical normal
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations on a
 
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
negligence claim of three years to six
 
01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:17.219 align:start position:0%
years given that what we now know by way
 
01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
of science with respect to
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
um the pfas chemical it's still the
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
causal element Still Remains so
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
um these are difficult cases to win
 
01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
um so it's not it's not an easy win but
 
01:28:31.370 --> 01:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
I think this recognizes a particular
 
01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
problem that we have in New Hampshire
 
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
with a particular chemical that is
 
01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
particularly problematic so thank you
 
01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%

representative Oregon
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
basically well Brandon Paige probably
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
said exactly one one to say but I just
 
01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
want to say a carfa for this is
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
entirely justifiable because we have a
 
01:28:59.090 --> 01:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
we have frankly is a a crisis and um
 
01:29:01.129 --> 01:29:01.139 align:start position:0%
these cases are going to be very
 
01:29:04.129 --> 01:29:04.139 align:start position:0%
difficult to prove I think the Carvel is
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate and the extra
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
time periods are probably just because
 
01:29:11.090 --> 01:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
it's so pervasive many cases
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
the leaders are very powerful
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
corporations who are very good at
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
defending themselves and of the
 
01:29:18.530 --> 01:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
consequences are
 
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
for those except for the damages are
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
very serious so I think this is uh I
 
01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
think this bill is a small first step to
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
once again as I cliche I used before
 
01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
which is leveling the playing field so I
 
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
I think a carve out this is entirely
 
01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:35.750 align:start position:0%
I think a carve out this is entirely
justifiable

01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
justifiable
 
01:29:37.729 --> 01:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
um so that's lame
 
01:29:42.410 --> 01:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:47.030 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:49.970 align:start position:0%

yes I'd make a motion to ought to pass
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
and um I won't elaborate more on the
 
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
points that I already made with regard
 
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
to opposing the itls I think all of
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
those the time time has come I think for
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
the science to catch up
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of catch up to the science as I
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
said before I think this makes sense in
 
01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
the context of New Hampshire we hear
 
01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
plenty of testimony about the impact of
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
pfas here and I think it's time for
 
01:31:58.010 --> 01:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
passage and I would vote to ought to
 
01:32:01.570 --> 01:32:01.580 align:start position:0%

bill but the Mortgage Bankers
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
Association mentioned in testimony that
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate was working on something
 
01:34:56.810 --> 01:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
comparable and uh so they were
 
01:34:59.209 --> 01:34:59.219 align:start position:0%
developing some language there so I
 
01:34:59.219 --> 01:34:59.930 align:start position:0%
developing some language there so I
think

01:34:59.930 --> 01:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:35:02.209 --> 01:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
um if we retain it it gives us an
 
01:35:04.729 --> 01:35:04.739 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see the product that the
 
01:35:06.649 --> 01:35:06.659 align:start position:0%

I don't know about you guys but I'm
 
01:55:54.109 --> 01:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
fairly certain my house is going to blow

flickering off and on during our break
 
01:56:03.229 --> 01:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
so hopefully I've been stable now for
 
01:56:05.629 --> 01:56:05.639 align:start position:0%
the last five minutes so hopefully yeah
 
01:56:05.639 --> 01:56:06.890 align:start position:0%
the last five minutes so hopefully yeah
good

01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:06.900 align:start position:0%

if
 
01:57:34.129 --> 01:57:34.139 align:start position:0%

01:58:22.609 --> 01:58:22.619 align:start position:0%
we heard this bill this is with regard
 
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
to Shared living facilities and there
 
01:58:27.050 --> 01:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
were questions raised as to whether or
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
not it needed more specific definition
 
01:58:33.709 --> 01:58:33.719 align:start position:0%
this amendment came from
 
01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh Elliott Berry actually he's the one
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
who raised the issue of the hearing
 
01:58:44.089 --> 01:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
and he proposed this amendment which he
 
01:58:46.729 --> 01:58:46.739 align:start position:0%
represented to me in his email he had
 
01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
reviewed uh with Mr Norman as well and
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
that they were in agreement on the
 
01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:55.430 align:start position:0%
that they were in agreement on the
amendment

01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.290 --> 01:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
and what it does is require that the
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
tenant identify in the petition in the
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
petition that's filed under 540b
 
01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
that there be a check box on the circuit
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
Court's form petition that the rental
 
01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
unit is governed by 540b which is in
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
fact the shared living facilities law
 
01:59:28.729 --> 01:59:28.739 align:start position:0%
and not under 548 a which is for the
 
01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative Smith
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:59:46.970 --> 01:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair
 
01:59:48.890 --> 01:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
can you
 
01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
um give me your
 
01:59:53.570 --> 01:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
either your legislative or your judicial
 
01:59:56.570 --> 01:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
advice that's up to you does this
 
02:00:01.149 --> 02:00:01.159 align:start position:0%
amendment address effectively
 
02:00:04.609 --> 02:00:04.619 align:start position:0%
the need or the the need for a
 
02:00:04.619 --> 02:00:06.770 align:start position:0%
the need or the the need for a
definition

02:00:06.770 --> 02:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
definition
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:12.239 --> 02:00:14.629 align:start position:0%
 
I

02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:00:16.970 --> 02:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it provides a definition
 
02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the facilities I don't know without
 
02:00:21.890 --> 02:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
going back and looking at the statute as
 
02:00:23.330 --> 02:00:23.340 align:start position:0%
to whether or not they're further
 
02:00:28.930 --> 02:00:28.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:33.850 --> 02:00:33.860 align:start position:0%
oh Mr chair that's a disappointing
 
02:00:36.669 --> 02:00:36.679 align:start position:0%
response um because
 
02:00:40.430 --> 02:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
my concern is there seems to be so much
 
02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:43.129 align:start position:0%
my concern is there seems to be so much
confusion

02:00:43.129 --> 02:00:43.139 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
um around what exactly a shared facility
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
is and I see that this amendment uh does
 
02:00:55.129 --> 02:00:55.139 align:start position:0%
attempt to clarify which specific
 
02:00:58.910 --> 02:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
section which specific RSA
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
is relevant
 
02:01:01.199 --> 02:01:02.810 align:start position:0%
is relevant
and

02:01:02.810 --> 02:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:03.709 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:01:03.709 --> 02:01:03.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:06.890 --> 02:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
I guess I just need assurance that it is
 
02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:09.129 align:start position:0%
I guess I just need assurance that it is
enough

02:01:09.129 --> 02:01:09.139 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
specificity so that we're not making
 
02:01:18.410 --> 02:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I can give you that
 
02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:26.209 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I can give you that
specificity

02:01:26.209 --> 02:01:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't hear you I'm not sure
 
02:01:31.729 --> 02:01:31.739 align:start position:0%
I can give you that specificity thank
 
02:01:33.189 --> 02:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
you well you're enough with it
 
02:01:35.089 --> 02:01:35.099 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:43.250 --> 02:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
it's representative
 
02:01:47.209 --> 02:01:47.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I am I just want
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
to share my colleagues opinion I thought
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
I felt favorably about the testimony but
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
I I couldn't believe it I mean I've
 
02:01:55.970 --> 02:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
never heard of this type of living
 
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
situation and we don't have it here in
 
02:02:00.410 --> 02:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth so and when I think there was
 
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
a question about it and she's like well
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
everybody knows what it is it's like no
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know what it is and then so I I
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
could is this could we possibly retain
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
this to make sure that we have a
 
02:02:11.330 --> 02:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
definition of what exactly we're talking
 
02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:12.709 align:start position:0%
definition of what exactly we're talking
about

02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
um you know what type of living
 
02:02:17.089 --> 02:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
situation this is
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:24.490 --> 02:02:24.500 align:start position:0%
frankly I'd be perfectly happy
 
02:02:28.070 --> 02:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I I meant excuse me if I could
 
02:02:29.169 --> 02:02:29.179 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:02:32.450 --> 02:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
I I meant if we could even hold it until
 
02:02:35.209 --> 02:02:35.219 align:start position:0%
if we're going to hold any bills maybe
 
02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
we could hold this one so that we could
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
check on that definition or add it to it
 
02:02:43.490 --> 02:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
because it does it seems like a narrow
 
02:02:44.930 --> 02:02:44.940 align:start position:0%
um group of people that if we could help
 
02:02:46.729 --> 02:02:46.739 align:start position:0%
them I don't have a problem with that so
 
02:02:48.530 --> 02:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
I didn't mean retain I'm you know we
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
could just
 
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
recess this here this part executive
 
02:02:53.570 --> 02:02:53.580 align:start position:0%

02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to uh we'll proceed with our
 
02:09:49.550 --> 02:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
executive session today but I'm going to
 
02:09:51.350 --> 02:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
be sensitive to the fact that we have a
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
member missing and we'll deal with that
 
02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:00.890 --> 02:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
next is House Bill 368 an act relative
 
02:10:05.390 --> 02:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:09.070 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:10:09.070 --> 02:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:10:15.290 --> 02:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
um I uh move uh ought to pass on HB uh
 
02:10:20.930 --> 02:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
368 and offer Amendment zero four nine
 
02:10:22.609 --> 02:10:22.619 align:start position:0%
four h
 
02:10:24.530 --> 02:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
which I think I'm about to everybody on
 
02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:26.970 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:26.970 --> 02:10:29.689 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

02:10:29.689 --> 02:10:29.699 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
02:10:33.229 --> 02:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
representative Chase sentence the motion
 
02:10:37.010 --> 02:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
we want to address your Amendment okay
 
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
um well uh yeah I think the
 
02:10:43.850 --> 02:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
with the amendment uh
 
02:10:46.370 --> 02:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm off for the amendment is
 
02:10:48.109 --> 02:10:48.119 align:start position:0%
in in the public hearing I ask
 
02:10:51.229 --> 02:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
representative Cushing the question uh
 
02:10:52.390 --> 02:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
which was
 
02:10:56.930 --> 02:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
since the governor had vetoed this uh in
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
the last session what really was
 
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
different and his response was you know
 
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
there's a higher level of urgency but
 
02:11:08.270 --> 02:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
really I think that the governor did
 
02:11:11.689 --> 02:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
raise some concerns but I think what we
 
02:11:14.450 --> 02:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
have to understand is that the g e is
 
02:11:16.669 --> 02:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
really out of the bottle with respect to
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
Medical monitoring
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
um courts are starting to recognize that
 
02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
we had the Herman's versus TCI case at
 
02:11:25.609 --> 02:11:25.619 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro Superior Court which
 
02:11:27.050 --> 02:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
um authorized sort of by the class
 
02:11:30.070 --> 02:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
action and yeah
 
02:11:32.629 --> 02:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
Federal District Court uh there
 
02:11:32.639 --> 02:11:34.430 align:start position:0%
Federal District Court uh there
certified

02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
certified
 
02:11:36.589 --> 02:11:36.599 align:start position:0%
um for medical monitoring so the
 
02:11:38.149 --> 02:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
question really is
 
02:11:40.070 --> 02:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
are we going to leave all this to the
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
courts or are we as the legislature
 
02:11:47.810 --> 02:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
going to be a voice in that discussion
 
02:11:49.790 --> 02:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
and show some leadership in that
 
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
discussion we can be practical
 
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
Governor vetoed it last time around with
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
this but this amendment does is it looks
 
02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
at uh Vermont amendment that
 
02:12:05.629 --> 02:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
um the governor of Vermont who also
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
vetoed medical monitor legislation in
 
02:12:10.070 --> 02:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
Vermont said he would support medical
 
02:12:13.129 --> 02:12:13.139 align:start position:0%
monitoring legislation if there was an
 
02:12:15.709 --> 02:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
amendment that clarified
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
um the nature of of the Harem and so
 
02:12:22.030 --> 02:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is it
 
02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
incorporates that by adding one term and
 
02:12:27.050 --> 02:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
that one term if you read is the
 
02:12:28.729 --> 02:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
plaintiff now suffers from a
 
02:12:32.990 --> 02:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
significantly increased risk so just the
 
02:12:35.810 --> 02:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
addition of that one term significantly
 
02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
increased risk that actually adds a lot
 
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
of clarity and the reason that it adds
 
02:12:44.330 --> 02:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
Clarity is because the terms
 
02:12:47.410 --> 02:12:47.420 align:start position:0%
significantly is a statistically
 
02:12:50.990 --> 02:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
universally accepted term so I think it
 
02:12:52.970 --> 02:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
really takes a lot of the fuzziness out
 
02:12:55.129 --> 02:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
of it any statistician anywhere in the
 
02:12:57.550 --> 02:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
world when they do hypothesis testing
 
02:13:00.050 --> 02:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
understands what a significantly
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
increased risk is there's hard
 
02:13:05.209 --> 02:13:05.219 align:start position:0%
statistical rules around that and this
 
02:13:06.890 --> 02:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
is the language that the Vermont
 
02:13:10.010 --> 02:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
Governor said if it was incorporated he
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
would support that kind of medical
 
02:13:14.030 --> 02:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
monitoring legislation so my hope is by
 
02:13:16.370 --> 02:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
doing this we can go back to the house
 
02:13:18.410 --> 02:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
we can go back to the governor and we
 
02:13:19.850 --> 02:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
can say this is the change that we've
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
made and this is why you should rethink
 
02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
your position on the detail so that's
 
02:13:25.250 --> 02:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
the nature of the amendment going to
 
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:34.189 --> 02:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:36.410 --> 02:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
yes representative Chase
 
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
I just want to agree with representative
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
McLean we've done a really lot of hard
 
02:13:44.629 --> 02:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
work on this looked at it from every
 
02:13:48.109 --> 02:13:48.119 align:start position:0%
angle I like the amendment and I would
 
02:13:49.850 --> 02:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
hope that we can
 
02:13:54.229 --> 02:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
yeah anyone else
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%

it has
 
02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:39.310 align:start position:0%
it has
12.

02:15:39.310 --> 02:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
12.
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
you've adopted the amendment we're back
 
02:15:47.750 --> 02:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
to the motion uh hard to pass as amended
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
just one thing uh Mr chairman if I could
 
02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:57.890 align:start position:0%
just one thing uh Mr chairman if I could
yeah

02:15:57.890 --> 02:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:16:00.589 --> 02:16:00.599 align:start position:0%
I think on this uh there was a strong
 
02:16:02.810 --> 02:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
case made that essentially you're
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
tapping into a limited pool of money
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
and additional monies that are spent on
 
02:16:11.689 --> 02:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
medical monitoring for people who don't
 
02:16:14.089 --> 02:16:14.099 align:start position:0%
necessarily need it
 
02:16:17.330 --> 02:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
takes away from those who are in need so
 
02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:28.609 --> 02:16:28.619 align:start position:0%
yeah so Mr chairman now that I will also
 
02:16:31.129 --> 02:16:31.139 align:start position:0%
be voting against this bill I just don't
 
02:16:33.349 --> 02:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
think we should be enacting this into
 
02:16:33.359 --> 02:16:34.849 align:start position:0%
think we should be enacting this into
law

02:16:34.849 --> 02:16:34.859 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we need to create
 
02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:39.230 align:start position:0%
this new resort situation
 
02:16:39.230 --> 02:16:45.589 align:start position:0%
this new resort situation
[Applause]

02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative Chase
 
02:16:50.209 --> 02:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:16:53.570 --> 02:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
committee I just want to say I I also
 
02:16:56.030 --> 02:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
heard that about having depleted funds
 
02:16:58.969 --> 02:16:58.979 align:start position:0%
and businesses going out this with the
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
amendment the way I read it and the work
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
that we've been doing this is showing if
 
02:17:07.070 --> 02:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
somebody is showing significant
 
02:17:09.469 --> 02:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
suffering now significantly from an
 
02:17:12.469 --> 02:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
increased risk of an illness it's not
 
02:17:15.049 --> 02:17:15.059 align:start position:0%
just for anybody who thinks that they've
 
02:17:18.469 --> 02:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
been exposed but bringing that up to
 
02:17:20.509 --> 02:17:20.519 align:start position:0%
your doctor that you have been exposed
 
02:17:23.089 --> 02:17:23.099 align:start position:0%
at some time or you feel you have well
 
02:17:25.490 --> 02:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
just keep that in the records and also
 
02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
give it the um opportunity that if
 
02:17:30.349 --> 02:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
something does start to come up that it
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
can look back to be related to what had
 
02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
happened within the water system or the
 
02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
ground I don't feel that this is just
 
02:17:41.570 --> 02:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
people signing up raising their hands
 
02:17:45.169 --> 02:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
saying I think I was disposed I need you
 
02:17:48.830 --> 02:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
to now monitor me this is um lot of care
 
02:17:50.870 --> 02:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of people that have
 
02:17:52.310 --> 02:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
been heard from this and we're going to
 
02:17:55.129 --> 02:17:55.139 align:start position:0%
find there a lot more I urge you please
 
02:17:59.629 --> 02:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:59.639 --> 02:18:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:18:01.910 --> 02:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:18:04.610 --> 02:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
oh thank you very much well this is a
 
02:18:08.089 --> 02:18:08.099 align:start position:0%
view this same comment about the earlier
 
02:18:11.389 --> 02:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
chill about the pfast at this uh this is
 
02:18:13.310 --> 02:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
a uh hopefully when this works right
 
02:18:15.349 --> 02:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's a preventative uh preventative
 
02:18:18.349 --> 02:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
measure so the medical monitoring can uh
 
02:18:20.629 --> 02:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
first of all people's minds at ease if
 
02:18:23.629 --> 02:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
they're I don't have any diseases of
 
02:18:26.929 --> 02:18:26.939 align:start position:0%
British culture but also like it will uh
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
they'll find they'll detect the disease
 
02:18:31.070 --> 02:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
and treat it sooner so that'll save a
 
02:18:33.110 --> 02:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
lot of suffering and I'm also
 
02:18:36.410 --> 02:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
I believe the asbestos uh
 
02:18:38.410 --> 02:18:38.420 align:start position:0%
cases came up with John's management
 
02:18:41.810 --> 02:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
it's just a full disclosure my my uh
 
02:18:44.089 --> 02:18:44.099 align:start position:0%
late father was a member of the class
 
02:18:46.429 --> 02:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
which had many millions of people for
 
02:18:49.009 --> 02:18:49.019 align:start position:0%
the Asbestos and certainly uh
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
you know we
 
02:18:52.669 --> 02:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
the amount of money we got with minimal
 
02:18:54.290 --> 02:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
comparative amount of suffering he had
 
02:18:56.690 --> 02:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
and he was vastly more fortunate than a
 
02:18:58.910 --> 02:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
lot of other people so you know this uh
 
02:19:02.089 --> 02:19:02.099 align:start position:0%
you know you don't want to so so I think
 
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
anything any type of suffering we can
 
02:19:06.530 --> 02:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
prevent that that's good and I think the
 
02:19:08.030 --> 02:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think the cost of this is
 
02:19:09.950 --> 02:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
excessive unless of course they detect
 
02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
the disease and then they that the whole
 
02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:13.009 align:start position:0%
the disease and then they that the whole
other

02:19:13.009 --> 02:19:13.019 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:19:15.530 --> 02:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
that's a whole other uh issue but
 
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
anyways I think this is a this is a good
 
02:19:20.509 --> 02:19:20.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:24.349 --> 02:19:24.359 align:start position:0%

disclosed earlier which probably others
 
02:20:39.530 --> 02:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
don't think that rises the level of

hey would you like to address your
 
02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:25.070 align:start position:0%
hey would you like to address your
motion

02:22:25.070 --> 02:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:27.830 --> 02:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much Mr chair yes I
 
02:22:30.650 --> 02:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
would um address my motion
 
02:22:33.650 --> 02:22:33.660 align:start position:0%
um this bill has to do with prohibiting
 
02:22:37.550 --> 02:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
the sharing of location data
 
02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:38.330 align:start position:0%
the sharing of location data
um

02:22:38.330 --> 02:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:42.770 --> 02:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
I have long been and continue to be an
 
02:22:46.610 --> 02:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
advocate for privacy
 
02:22:49.490 --> 02:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
that personal privacy is an important
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
component of uh of how we can live our
 
02:22:59.570 --> 02:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
free lives in this country I believe
 
02:23:02.809 --> 02:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
very strongly that this should be a
 
02:23:02.819 --> 02:23:03.670 align:start position:0%
very strongly that this should be a
matter

02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
matter
 
02:23:07.210 --> 02:23:07.220 align:start position:0%
addressed confidently and intelligently
 
02:23:11.210 --> 02:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
on the federal level in fact it would be
 
02:23:15.290 --> 02:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
most effective if this was a national
 
02:23:18.650 --> 02:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
policy but one of the great benefits
 
02:23:21.490 --> 02:23:21.500 align:start position:0%
that we have from our form of government
 
02:23:26.929 --> 02:23:26.939 align:start position:0%
is that many sound ideas were tried out
 
02:23:32.750 --> 02:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
first in States and when then people in
 
02:23:35.870 --> 02:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
various states were able to see that it
 
02:23:39.050 --> 02:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
does work and it makes sense that has
 
02:23:44.690 --> 02:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
moved our federal officials to find the
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
courage and the knowledge to take
 
02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate action and so while I don't
 
02:23:54.670 --> 02:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
think that the ideal answer is to have
 
02:23:58.490 --> 02:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
this handled on a state-by-state basis
 
02:24:01.550 --> 02:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
the Journey of a Thousand Miles begins
 
02:24:04.670 --> 02:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
with one step and I believe this is a
 
02:24:08.050 --> 02:24:08.060 align:start position:0%
solid first step for this state to take
 
02:24:10.429 --> 02:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
in protecting
 
02:24:10.439 --> 02:24:11.330 align:start position:0%
in protecting
um

02:24:11.330 --> 02:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:14.750 --> 02:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
in an appropriate responsible way
 
02:24:20.929 --> 02:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:24.530 --> 02:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander
 
02:24:26.990 --> 02:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you Mr chair
 
02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:27.889 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you Mr chair
um

02:24:27.889 --> 02:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:30.170 --> 02:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
while I am sympathetic to representative
 
02:24:33.050 --> 02:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
Smith's uh coins I am going to oppose
 
02:24:34.429 --> 02:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
um I do believe it needs to be a
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
national policy and that's why I
 
02:24:39.230 --> 02:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
recommend uh representative Smith
 
02:24:41.570 --> 02:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
reached out to her congressmen so we can
 
02:24:43.250 --> 02:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
get this rolling
 
02:24:45.290 --> 02:24:45.300 align:start position:0%
um I believe having federal or worldwide
 
02:24:47.809 --> 02:24:47.819 align:start position:0%
companies we write policies for one out
 
02:24:50.690 --> 02:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
of 50 states it's uh not really a
 
02:24:52.910 --> 02:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
productive way of doing things
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
um I think that there was a problem with
 
02:24:57.889 --> 02:24:57.899 align:start position:0%
um sharing of aggregate data by
 
02:25:01.070 --> 02:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
companies so they can perform the best
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
way possible in big cities and I think
 
02:25:06.170 --> 02:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
this really adversely affects the gig
 
02:25:09.050 --> 02:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
economy we should be pursuing avenues
 
02:25:11.389 --> 02:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
that allow the gig economy to grow and I
 
02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
think location data helps them really
 
02:25:16.190 --> 02:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
figure out where their customers are and
 
02:25:18.290 --> 02:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
where they're moving so I just in
 
02:25:20.750 --> 02:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
general that this is a bad Bill that
 
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:24.020 align:start position:0%
hurts Innovation the gig economy and uh
 
02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't support
 
02:25:27.430 --> 02:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:30.250 align:start position:0%
thank you
[Applause]

02:25:30.250 --> 02:25:30.260 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:42.479 --> 02:25:43.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:46.309 --> 02:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that stops the company
 
02:25:48.349 --> 02:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
like Uber or any of these other
 
02:25:48.359 --> 02:25:49.730 align:start position:0%
like Uber or any of these other
economies

02:25:49.730 --> 02:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
economies
 
02:25:53.870 --> 02:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:56.929 --> 02:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
from using the data to take water for
 
02:25:59.450 --> 02:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
their own purposes or to satisfy
 
02:26:01.610 --> 02:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
requests for from the individual or
 
02:26:03.710 --> 02:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
other services that they might desire as
 
02:26:07.790 --> 02:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
long as they request it or in this broad
 
02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
exemptions the law enforcement or
 
02:26:12.650 --> 02:26:12.660 align:start position:0%
emergency situations and all those types
 
02:26:14.990 --> 02:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
of things those are Exempted out of this
 
02:26:17.270 --> 02:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
bill this is about
 
02:26:19.550 --> 02:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
those companies taking your personal
 
02:26:21.950 --> 02:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
data and we had we had testimony during
 
02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
the year
 
02:26:25.550 --> 02:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
the gentleman who was the actual driver
 
02:26:27.170 --> 02:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
that still brought it to our attention
 
02:26:29.150 --> 02:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
02:26:32.090 --> 02:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
in 15 minutes putting in his own phone
 
02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:33.170 align:start position:0%
in 15 minutes putting in his own phone
number

02:26:33.170 --> 02:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:26:35.210 --> 02:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
to find out enormous amounts of
 
02:26:36.889 --> 02:26:36.899 align:start position:0%
information by himself
 
02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'm worried about the things that he had
 
02:26:40.849 --> 02:26:40.859 align:start position:0%
done this is not right
 
02:26:43.250 --> 02:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
this should be stopped if we can only do
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that we just do it in New
 
02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:46.309 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that we just do it in New
Hampshire

02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:26:49.790 --> 02:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
so that's not uh the amendment that I
 
02:26:53.809 --> 02:26:53.819 align:start position:0%
offer is uh Amendment 0155
 
02:26:59.570 --> 02:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:01.969 --> 02:27:01.979 align:start position:0%
it it replaces the applicability
 
02:27:01.979 --> 02:27:04.730 align:start position:0%
it it replaces the applicability
paragraph

02:27:04.730 --> 02:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
02:27:04.740 --> 02:27:06.050 align:start position:0%
paragraph
thanks

02:27:06.050 --> 02:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
02:27:07.790 --> 02:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
big difference between the bill this
 
02:27:09.889 --> 02:27:09.899 align:start position:0%
year and last year is that last year we
 
02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
Felix about what providers this year
 
02:27:15.770 --> 02:27:15.780 align:start position:0%
we're talking about developers and much
 
02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
broader spectrum of the people to whom
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
this would apply
 
02:27:22.969 --> 02:27:22.979 align:start position:0%
and some of our other some language gets
 
02:27:25.130 --> 02:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
snuck into that paragraph about where
 
02:27:30.349 --> 02:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:33.170 --> 02:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
the bad thing so hard to the language we
 
02:27:35.870 --> 02:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
used last year was very well accepted by
 
02:27:37.550 --> 02:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
02:27:39.469 --> 02:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that we're just talking
 
02:27:39.479 --> 02:27:40.429 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that we're just talking
about

02:27:40.429 --> 02:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
the information and the type position
 
02:27:45.770 --> 02:27:45.780 align:start position:0%
not exactly where it was required so
 
02:27:47.330 --> 02:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
that's where the one five five minutes
 
02:27:49.370 --> 02:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
got so and I would like to amend a
 
02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:59.210 --> 02:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
okay so we have uh then that's been
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
offered by representative
 
02:28:05.330 --> 02:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I would be happy
 
02:28:08.270 --> 02:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
um to remove my
 
02:28:08.280 --> 02:28:09.710 align:start position:0%
um to remove my
um motion

02:28:09.710 --> 02:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
um motion
 
02:28:12.410 --> 02:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
of just ought to pass
 
02:28:15.170 --> 02:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
um if it makes things neater from the
 
02:28:18.230 --> 02:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
point of view or process and um and if
 
02:28:21.530 --> 02:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
the seconder agrees I would then move
 
02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:24.170 align:start position:0%
the seconder agrees I would then move
otpa

02:28:24.170 --> 02:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
otpa
 
02:28:28.730 --> 02:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
uh with with representative goldfish
 
02:28:28.740 --> 02:28:31.370 align:start position:0%
uh with with representative goldfish
yes

02:28:31.370 --> 02:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:28:33.170 --> 02:28:33.180 align:start position:0%
I second that
 
02:28:35.030 --> 02:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
you agree with that representative
 
02:28:36.889 --> 02:28:36.899 align:start position:0%
Sylvia yes
 
02:28:40.130 --> 02:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
representative so we're actually looking
 
02:28:44.650 --> 02:28:44.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:47.809 --> 02:28:47.819 align:start position:0%
4155h but we need to do two books right
 
02:28:50.510 --> 02:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
we'll do two votes but representative
 
02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:53.510 align:start position:0%
we'll do two votes but representative
Verge

02:28:53.510 --> 02:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:55.849 --> 02:28:55.859 align:start position:0%
yes it's more directed towards the
 
02:28:59.389 --> 02:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
overall build which regretfully I will
 
02:29:02.330 --> 02:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
not be able to support I think it's
 
02:29:05.210 --> 02:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
number one it's it's too broad
 
02:29:07.610 --> 02:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
and one of the areas where I think it's
 
02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
too broad is it makes no effective uh
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
division between the collection of
 
02:29:20.030 --> 02:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
anonymous data and non-anonymous data
 
02:29:23.150 --> 02:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
and I know for instance and that's a big
 
02:29:25.070 --> 02:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
difference they're used for different
 
02:29:30.770 --> 02:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
purposes and uh others if we want to go
 
02:29:32.990 --> 02:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
state by state which is a bad way of
 
02:29:35.450 --> 02:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
doing it uh at least we should take a
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
look at what other states have found not
 
02:29:42.010 --> 02:29:42.020 align:start position:0%
to be a good idea in California found
 
02:29:45.530 --> 02:29:45.540 align:start position:0%
that lumping together Anonymous
 
02:29:47.570 --> 02:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
collection and non-anonymous collection
 
02:29:50.510 --> 02:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
was a bad idea and they separated it
 
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
into two different areas
 
02:29:56.210 --> 02:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that
 
02:29:56.220 --> 02:29:56.870 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that
um

02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:00.290 --> 02:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
this bill is so broad it may affect the
 
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
ability of
 
02:30:07.130 --> 02:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
my my credit card company or whatever or
 
02:30:10.490 --> 02:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
Amazon to call me and say there's a
 
02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
purchase made in Monaco
 
02:30:15.230 --> 02:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
you know four thousand dollars worth of
 
02:30:18.550 --> 02:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
handbags are you sure you did that
 
02:30:21.410 --> 02:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
and I just point out would probably say
 
02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
no I didn't
 
02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
and I
 
02:30:28.190 --> 02:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
it's easy just to say privacy privacy
 
02:30:31.150 --> 02:30:31.160 align:start position:0%
privacy but we still need to have
 
02:30:35.210 --> 02:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
legislation that's clear concise and
 
02:30:37.250 --> 02:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
avoids uh
 
02:30:39.889 --> 02:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
collateral consequences that we may not
 
02:30:39.899 --> 02:30:41.570 align:start position:0%
collateral consequences that we may not
like

02:30:41.570 --> 02:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:30:43.429 --> 02:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:30:45.410 --> 02:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative Smith did you wish to
 
02:30:48.170 --> 02:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think so thank you
 
02:30:54.290 --> 02:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan I'm sorry my hand
 
02:30:56.929 --> 02:30:56.939 align:start position:0%
was up I didn't realize
 
02:30:58.969 --> 02:30:58.979 align:start position:0%
um thank you very very much Mr chair I
 
02:31:01.550 --> 02:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
mean I think this feels too broad it's a
 
02:31:03.469 --> 02:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
federal issue and also
 
02:31:05.210 --> 02:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't address the problem what happens
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
when somebody there's lots of things we
 
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
do in the web where your location is
 
02:31:12.170 --> 02:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
part of the point of it like uh like
 
02:31:14.450 --> 02:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
today when you post pictures of yourself
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
on Facebook or uh I guess it doesn't
 
02:31:19.190 --> 02:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
exist anymore but parlor or whatever
 
02:31:20.570 --> 02:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
which um
 
02:31:24.530 --> 02:31:24.540 align:start position:0%
and um a lot of times you're literally
 
02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
you advertise you write a location
 
02:31:28.730 --> 02:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
deliberately or maybe the integral part
 
02:31:30.530 --> 02:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
of the service and then
 
02:31:32.090 --> 02:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:31:34.670 --> 02:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
and then you have regrets later so
 
02:31:37.550 --> 02:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
that's not really a social media site 12
 
02:31:39.770 --> 02:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
but it does seem like a
 
02:31:42.410 --> 02:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of does that seem like
 
02:31:43.730 --> 02:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
people often like
 
02:31:45.410 --> 02:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
if you're trying to get people from
 
02:31:47.630 --> 02:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
getting trouble because uh some somebody
 
02:31:49.309 --> 02:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
knows where they are a lot of times just
 
02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
because you've deliberately advertised
 
02:31:54.110 --> 02:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
where you are but then somebody else is
 
02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
using the service uh doesn't like the
 
02:31:58.070 --> 02:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
fact that you were there so that's uh
 
02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
they just feel it that's just one of our
 
02:32:01.610 --> 02:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
multitude of problems with this build so

02:32:13.309 --> 02:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and I just want to
 
02:32:15.650 --> 02:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
respond to this as far as a
 
02:32:18.050 --> 02:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
disaggregated data that's not attached
 
02:32:21.170 --> 02:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:23.750 --> 02:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
then if you publicly share your location
 
02:32:25.550 --> 02:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
then that makes that public and it's no
 
02:32:28.250 --> 02:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
longer subject to a privacy interest
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
so I don't see why that would be
 
02:32:33.170 --> 02:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
involved so I don't see it that was a
 
02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:37.560 align:start position:0%

a motion I do I'd like to make an
 
02:51:57.830 --> 02:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
emotion uh to pass with Amendment
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
and I would like to refer to the
 
02:52:04.070 --> 02:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that you should have received
 
02:52:10.490 --> 02:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:10.500 --> 02:52:11.590 align:start position:0%
 
Ence

02:52:11.590 --> 02:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
Ence
 
02:52:14.990 --> 02:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
and is there a second to oh I'm sorry
 
02:52:17.690 --> 02:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
that motion
 
02:52:24.710 --> 02:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:26.690 --> 02:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead representative chicks all
 
02:52:27.710 --> 02:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
right I want to
 
02:52:30.530 --> 02:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
know the amendment and again that is oh
 
02:52:33.650 --> 02:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
five six five h
 
02:52:36.590 --> 02:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh there was a little bit of concern
 
02:52:40.750 --> 02:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
with the statement of findings and
 
02:52:43.790 --> 02:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
02:52:43.800 --> 02:52:44.929 align:start position:0%
relative to
a

02:52:44.929 --> 02:52:44.939 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:52:47.050 --> 02:52:47.060 align:start position:0%
disability is
 
02:52:50.870 --> 02:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
we talked about this quite a bit I did
 
02:52:53.330 --> 02:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
agree with that yet I didn't find that
 
02:52:56.630 --> 02:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
it had a lot to do with the body and of
 
02:53:00.170 --> 02:53:00.180 align:start position:0%
the bill but it was not needed so that
 
02:53:02.630 --> 02:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
has been removed
 
02:53:05.330 --> 02:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
and also there were a couple of other
 
02:53:07.190 --> 02:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
amendments that came through that have
 
02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
been incorporated into this and those
 
02:53:14.389 --> 02:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
are in regards to the IEP team and what
 
02:53:17.809 --> 02:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
a they would do with a student or family
 
02:53:20.090 --> 02:53:20.100 align:start position:0%
the team shall inform the student and
 
02:53:22.130 --> 02:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
the family of the ability to support
 
02:53:26.170 --> 02:53:26.180 align:start position:0%
decision making in pursuant to RSA
 
02:53:29.870 --> 02:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
464--d as an alternative to guardianship
 
02:53:31.910 --> 02:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
it should be done promptly when
 
02:53:35.150 --> 02:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
guardianship is first discussed
 
02:53:37.849 --> 02:53:37.859 align:start position:0%
team should make available resources and
 
02:53:39.469 --> 02:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
assist in establishing a support
 
02:53:42.230 --> 02:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
decision-making agreement
 
02:53:45.530 --> 02:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
if that is executed the IEP team shall
 
02:53:47.690 --> 02:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
abide by the decisions made by the
 
02:53:49.429 --> 02:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
student pursuant to the reported
 
02:53:52.370 --> 02:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
decision making agreement
 
02:53:55.849 --> 02:53:55.859 align:start position:0%
um and basically that's it we just tried
 
02:53:55.859 --> 02:53:58.250 align:start position:0%
um and basically that's it we just tried
to

02:53:58.250 --> 02:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:01.610 --> 02:54:01.620 align:start position:0%
clear up what possibly was considered
 
02:54:03.590 --> 02:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
and I'd hate to use this but offensive
 
02:54:06.590 --> 02:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
and I agree language about
 
02:54:10.190 --> 02:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
um the definition of disabled in the
 
02:54:10.200 --> 02:54:11.450 align:start position:0%
um the definition of disabled in the
subject

02:54:11.450 --> 02:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
subject
 
02:54:14.090 --> 02:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
statement of findings and the rest is
 
02:54:16.670 --> 02:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
just the work that's been done with the
 
02:54:16.680 --> 02:54:18.650 align:start position:0%
just the work that's been done with the
stakeholders

02:54:18.650 --> 02:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
02:54:20.809 --> 02:54:20.819 align:start position:0%
and task force group that has been
 
02:54:22.490 --> 02:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
working on this
 
02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
so I would urge you if to vote for the
 
02:54:27.650 --> 02:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
amendment and then ought to pass on the
 
02:54:27.660 --> 02:54:29.389 align:start position:0%
amendment and then ought to pass on the
bill

02:54:29.389 --> 02:54:29.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:54:32.750 --> 02:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:34.429 --> 02:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:54:34.439 --> 02:54:36.469 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

02:54:36.469 --> 02:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:38.990 --> 02:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'm basically
 
02:54:41.830 --> 02:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
sort of supportive of the bill I'm not
 
02:54:44.870 --> 02:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
leading either particular way I was
 
02:54:47.690 --> 02:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
certainly concerned with the uh
 
02:54:47.700 --> 02:54:48.250 align:start position:0%
certainly concerned with the uh
the

02:54:48.250 --> 02:54:48.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:54:50.570 --> 02:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
unconscious bias that made its way into
 
02:54:55.070 --> 02:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
the findings originally and having only
 
02:54:57.830 --> 02:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
had a little while and essentially
 
02:54:59.870 --> 02:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
reading the amendment while we're doing
 
02:55:03.110 --> 02:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
this and falling behind on my other work
 
02:55:05.690 --> 02:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh for which I apologize
 
02:55:05.700 --> 02:55:06.230 align:start position:0%
uh for which I apologize
um

02:55:06.230 --> 02:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:06.240 --> 02:55:07.370 align:start position:0%
um
I

02:55:07.370 --> 02:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:55:09.429 --> 02:55:09.439 align:start position:0%
I would like more time to consider this
 
02:55:12.769 --> 02:55:12.779 align:start position:0%
uh so I I don't I don't feel like I'm
 
02:55:15.650 --> 02:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
prepared to vote for this at this time
 
02:55:21.170 --> 02:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:23.389 --> 02:55:23.399 align:start position:0%
see I ask a question
 
02:55:25.190 --> 02:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
yeah just just hold on I'm going to call
 
02:55:27.590 --> 02:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
upon uh represent Macbeth first and I'll
 
02:55:30.490 --> 02:55:30.500 align:start position:0%
come back to you representative Chase
 
02:55:32.809 --> 02:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
I apologize to the committee I just
 
02:55:34.190 --> 02:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
hadn't lowered my hand thank you I
 
02:55:36.410 --> 02:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
support this amendment but I I didn't
 
02:55:38.750 --> 02:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
raise my hand representative McLean yeah
 
02:55:40.730 --> 02:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
I I just want to Echo
 
02:55:42.889 --> 02:55:42.899 align:start position:0%
um representative Sylvia's comments
 
02:55:45.590 --> 02:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
while on broadly supportive of this I'm
 
02:55:48.050 --> 02:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
just getting the amendment uh at 10
 
02:55:49.790 --> 02:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
o'clock and so I'm just looking at it
 
02:55:52.190 --> 02:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
now I haven't really had time to process
 
02:55:55.969 --> 02:55:55.979 align:start position:0%
it so uh in light of that if we could
 
02:55:58.130 --> 02:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
maybe hold off a little bit
 
02:56:01.969 --> 02:56:01.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:03.530 --> 02:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
they could just ask representative
 
02:56:06.830 --> 02:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
Sylvia are you uh when you say to put
 
02:56:09.530 --> 02:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
off making a determination on it are you
 
02:56:11.389 --> 02:56:11.399 align:start position:0%
talking about maybe putting it off till
 
02:56:13.309 --> 02:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday or are you talking about
 
02:56:17.030 --> 02:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
retaining it until next week well
 
02:56:19.429 --> 02:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not as you've seen I'm not
 
02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
a fan of the retention
 
02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:22.309 align:start position:0%
a fan of the retention
um

02:56:22.309 --> 02:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:25.070 --> 02:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps by next Monday we could have
 
02:56:27.769 --> 02:56:27.779 align:start position:0%
some input from folks you know with
 
02:56:30.469 --> 02:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
disabilities uh because obviously they
 
02:56:32.450 --> 02:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
are more sensitive to the language than
 
02:56:35.690 --> 02:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
certainly I would be um you know more or
 
02:56:38.090 --> 02:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
less pretty whole although you know I
 
02:56:40.309 --> 02:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
have my defects
 
02:56:43.309 --> 02:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
um so next next Wednesday would be fine
 
02:56:46.490 --> 02:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:48.349 --> 02:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
would that be okay with you
 
02:56:50.870 --> 02:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative Chase
 
02:56:53.630 --> 02:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
I do not have a problem with that at all
 
02:56:56.870 --> 02:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I am also willing to remove the
 
02:56:59.510 --> 02:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
statement of findings completely if that
 
02:57:03.950 --> 02:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
is still a question to people after they
 
02:57:06.050 --> 02:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
read the amendment and still don't feel
 
02:57:08.809 --> 02:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it
 
02:57:13.130 --> 02:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:16.190 --> 02:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:20.090 --> 02:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
imagine that you I'm not muted
 
02:57:20.100 --> 02:57:21.410 align:start position:0%
imagine that you I'm not muted
um

02:57:21.410 --> 02:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:23.870 --> 02:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
um if representative Chase and
 
02:57:26.690 --> 02:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson would pull back
 
02:57:29.269 --> 02:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
um their motion
 
02:57:33.530 --> 02:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
um with uh respect for them and for
 
02:57:36.290 --> 02:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia's comments I don't
 
02:57:38.330 --> 02:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
think any of us have had a chance to
 
02:57:40.910 --> 02:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
really reflect
 
02:57:43.969 --> 02:57:43.979 align:start position:0%
um in detail on this amendment and I
 
02:57:45.650 --> 02:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
would hope that the chair would agree
 
02:57:45.660 --> 02:57:47.510 align:start position:0%
would hope that the chair would agree
that

02:57:47.510 --> 02:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:57:51.530 --> 02:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
um we added to next Wednesday's uh
 
02:57:53.630 --> 02:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
calendar and that would give people a
 
02:57:57.230 --> 02:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
time to look at the amendment and
 
02:57:57.240 --> 02:57:58.090 align:start position:0%
time to look at the amendment and
um

02:57:58.090 --> 02:57:58.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:00.469 --> 02:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
consider any further changes that they
 
02:58:04.330 --> 02:58:04.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:07.570 --> 02:58:07.580 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth
 
02:58:10.250 --> 02:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
I'd support that what
 
02:58:10.260 --> 02:58:12.769 align:start position:0%
I'd support that what
oops

02:58:12.769 --> 02:58:12.779 align:start position:0%
oops
 
02:58:14.269 --> 02:58:14.279 align:start position:0%
it's okay
 
02:58:14.279 --> 02:58:15.590 align:start position:0%
it's okay
so

02:58:15.590 --> 02:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:58:17.870 --> 02:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
I I have certainly have no objection
 
02:58:20.150 --> 02:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
that I'm presuming that representative
 
02:58:22.130 --> 02:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
Chase and representative Simpsons shoot
 
02:58:26.530 --> 02:58:26.540 align:start position:0%
withdraw your immediate devotions
 
02:58:29.330 --> 02:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
withdraw my emotion
 
02:58:33.050 --> 02:58:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:35.870 --> 02:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
well we'll plan to address House Bill

03:58:41.060 --> 03:58:53.140 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

03:58:53.140 --> 03:58:53.150 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:53.150 --> 03:59:11.389 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

03:59:11.389 --> 03:59:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:11.399 --> 03:59:22.610 align:start position:0%
 
much

03:59:22.610 --> 03:59:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:22.620 --> 03:59:24.830 align:start position:0%
 
us

03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:59:30.110 --> 03:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
hello everyone we're back from Recess
 
03:59:32.750 --> 03:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
and so I'll call the water this
 
03:59:41.769 --> 03:59:41.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:45.110 --> 03:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
I my account we have eight more bills to
 
03:59:50.450 --> 03:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:50.460 --> 03:59:52.309 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:59:52.309 --> 03:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:59:54.530 --> 03:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
the issue that I'm faced with is that we
 
03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
have several of these bills which I know
 
04:00:00.530 --> 04:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh and I've tried to reach out uh to uh
 
04:00:02.590 --> 04:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bryce
 
04:00:05.809 --> 04:00:05.819 align:start position:0%
uh but I have not heard back from her
 
04:00:08.389 --> 04:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
and don't actually know what her
 
04:00:11.389 --> 04:00:11.399 align:start position:0%
circumstances are
 
04:00:14.510 --> 04:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
I know some of the bills are going to be
 
04:00:17.389 --> 04:00:17.399 align:start position:0%
bills where we're going to have uh I
 
04:00:21.469 --> 04:00:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:21.479 --> 04:00:22.910 align:start position:0%
 
my

04:00:22.910 --> 04:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:00:25.189 --> 04:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
count we're going to have some very very
 
04:00:27.650 --> 04:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
close votes and her vote may very well
 
04:00:30.830 --> 04:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
make a difference on the outcome of
 
04:00:30.840 --> 04:00:31.870 align:start position:0%
make a difference on the outcome of
those

04:00:31.870 --> 04:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:00:34.670 --> 04:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations that we make
 
04:00:37.189 --> 04:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:00:39.170 --> 04:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
somewhat reluctant to go forward on
 
04:00:42.950 --> 04:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
those bills where I I think her vote
 
04:00:45.530 --> 04:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
would uh make a substantial difference
 
04:00:45.540 --> 04:00:46.729 align:start position:0%
would uh make a substantial difference
in

04:00:46.729 --> 04:00:46.739 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:00:50.210 --> 04:00:50.220 align:start position:0%
might want to if we're able to um those
 
04:00:52.490 --> 04:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
particular bills
 
04:00:52.500 --> 04:00:55.969 align:start position:0%
particular bills
consider

04:00:55.969 --> 04:00:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:58.189 --> 04:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
continuing them or recessing them and
 
04:01:00.769 --> 04:01:00.779 align:start position:0%
hearing them next Wednesday with the
 
04:01:03.710 --> 04:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
remainder of our bills
 
04:01:05.809 --> 04:01:05.819 align:start position:0%
but we do have some bills which I think
 
04:01:08.650 --> 04:01:08.660 align:start position:0%
we can take care of today
 
04:01:14.030 --> 04:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:16.849 --> 04:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
they have some hands
 
04:01:19.429 --> 04:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
representative Hardin
 
04:01:21.349 --> 04:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
um yes for planning purposes
 
04:01:24.469 --> 04:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
um the meeting we're having on Friday I
 
04:01:26.030 --> 04:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
mean it does have the usual notice about
 
04:01:26.040 --> 04:01:27.590 align:start position:0%
mean it does have the usual notice about
executive

04:01:27.590 --> 04:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
executive
 
04:01:29.269 --> 04:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
successes may be met by your your
 
04:01:31.610 --> 04:01:31.620 align:start position:0%
anticipation is that would be purely a
 
04:01:34.370 --> 04:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
day for hearings
 
04:01:36.769 --> 04:01:36.779 align:start position:0%
uh the only thing that's scheduled right
 
04:01:39.290 --> 04:01:39.300 align:start position:0%
now is hearings but we are capable of
 
04:01:41.809 --> 04:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
having executive session
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
I've I've tried to be very careful
 
04:01:47.090 --> 04:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
with the executive sessions so that I
 
04:01:49.010 --> 04:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody is available
 
04:01:51.590 --> 04:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
and incorporate them in the last few
 
04:01:52.849 --> 04:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
hearings we've had we haven't
 
04:01:54.469 --> 04:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily had everybody available
 
04:01:54.479 --> 04:01:55.490 align:start position:0%
necessarily had everybody available
today

04:01:55.490 --> 04:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:01:58.969 --> 04:01:58.979 align:start position:0%
to do an executive session so I haven't
 
04:02:00.910 --> 04:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
been having them
 
04:02:04.130 --> 04:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
but the fact is that we could do
 
04:02:08.090 --> 04:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
executive session on some bills
 
04:02:10.849 --> 04:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
if we elected to do so
 
04:02:12.590 --> 04:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
on Friday
 
04:02:14.330 --> 04:02:14.340 align:start position:0%
you know fair enough reasons for
 
04:02:15.530 --> 04:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
planning purposes is I have something
 
04:02:18.170 --> 04:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
scheduled at at three and I could
 
04:02:21.170 --> 04:02:21.180 align:start position:0%
reschedule it with enough advance notice
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
but um I'll uh
 
04:02:26.090 --> 04:02:26.100 align:start position:0%
but I'll play it by years so thanks
 
04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
no I'm trying to be as inclusive as
 
04:02:32.570 --> 04:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
everybody for everybody and that's why I
 
04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
sort of scheduled these separate days
 
04:02:36.710 --> 04:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
for the executive session so people
 
04:02:40.010 --> 04:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
could plan for sure to be there or find
 
04:02:41.269 --> 04:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
a substitute
 
04:02:41.279 --> 04:02:43.070 align:start position:0%
a substitute
thanks

04:02:43.070 --> 04:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:02:48.349 --> 04:02:48.359 align:start position:0%

roommates uh are in the apartment and
 
04:02:59.090 --> 04:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
maybe throughout the room uh for the
 
04:03:01.309 --> 04:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
rest of the exec thank you

and representative Smith
 
04:03:07.729 --> 04:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
thank you I guess I should say that my
 
04:03:09.650 --> 04:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement which was
 
04:03:11.750 --> 04:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
interrupted for a few hours this morning
 
04:03:15.110 --> 04:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
is now back and I'm alone again and it
 
04:03:18.290 --> 04:03:18.300 align:start position:0%
was very nice to have someone uh a floor
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
away but um I do want to say that I
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the care that
 
04:03:27.889 --> 04:03:27.899 align:start position:0%
you have demonstrated in announcing in
 
04:03:30.710 --> 04:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
advance when you were going to exec I
 
04:03:32.330 --> 04:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
think that's best for the committee and
 
04:03:34.849 --> 04:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
it's best for the public
 
04:03:38.510 --> 04:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
um and I uh the current schedule for
 
04:03:41.630 --> 04:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday isn't exhausting
 
04:03:43.370 --> 04:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
certainly the way this one could have
 
04:03:45.349 --> 04:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
been so
 
04:03:47.750 --> 04:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
um as I look at the afternoon I see
 
04:03:51.710 --> 04:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
three bills that I can identify where
 
04:03:53.450 --> 04:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure the sense of the
 
04:03:56.769 --> 04:03:56.779 align:start position:0%
committee will be if not completely
 
04:04:01.969 --> 04:04:01.979 align:start position:0%
uh unanimous be significantly so and
 
04:04:04.610 --> 04:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could go ahead with those and
 
04:04:08.450 --> 04:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
then you still would have time to put in
 
04:04:11.389 --> 04:04:11.399 align:start position:0%
the calendar an amended notice for next
 
04:04:14.870 --> 04:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
Wednesday to which you could add all of
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
the bills that we would like to defer
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
until then and I
 
04:04:20.399 --> 04:04:21.170 align:start position:0%
until then and I
um

04:04:21.170 --> 04:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:25.790 --> 04:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
I I and and I would encourage that
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
because I think that's best for public
 
04:04:30.290 --> 04:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
notice and for the committee planning
 
04:04:34.309 --> 04:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:38.150 --> 04:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
with that uh that's exactly what I would
 
04:04:41.090 --> 04:04:41.100 align:start position:0%
like to do I and if I'm not in it if we
 
04:04:42.410 --> 04:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
don't if I don't have the same three
 
04:04:44.750 --> 04:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
bills representative Smith you let me
 
04:04:45.950 --> 04:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
know but
 
04:04:48.349 --> 04:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
I think the next bill I call would be
 
04:04:56.640 --> 04:04:56.650 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:56.650 --> 04:04:58.630 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

04:04:58.630 --> 04:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
Senator Macbeth would you like to make a
 
04:05:02.990 --> 04:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
motion on that
 
04:05:03.000 --> 04:05:09.530 align:start position:0%
motion on that
[Applause]

04:05:09.530 --> 04:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
um itl
 
04:05:13.010 --> 04:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to speak on my motion if
 
04:05:15.290 --> 04:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
there's a second yeah if there are a
 
04:05:17.769 --> 04:05:17.779 align:start position:0%
second for that
 
04:05:21.170 --> 04:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
by representative Alexander
 
04:05:23.870 --> 04:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead and speak thank you Mr
 
04:05:26.510 --> 04:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
chair so um I think that the you know
 
04:05:28.010 --> 04:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
the representative that brought this
 
04:05:30.290 --> 04:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
bill really shows what you know the
 
04:05:32.269 --> 04:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
citizen legislature is all about uh
 
04:05:34.429 --> 04:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
constituent had come to him with a quite
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know a concern and um he's brought
 
04:05:39.290 --> 04:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
the bill to
 
04:05:41.150 --> 04:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
um the legislature you know he's had a
 
04:05:42.530 --> 04:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
full hearing
 
04:05:43.849 --> 04:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
um you know he was able to speak with
 
04:05:45.590 --> 04:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
the the Chief Justice at the superior
 
04:05:48.050 --> 04:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
court and you know the representatives
 
04:05:49.490 --> 04:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
from the administrative Court in the
 
04:05:51.950 --> 04:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
drug court I I think that all those
 
04:05:54.170 --> 04:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
stakeholders really heard the concerns
 
04:05:56.689 --> 04:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
that he was his client his constituent
 
04:05:59.630 --> 04:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
had and um you know
 
04:06:02.809 --> 04:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
I well while I'm italing the bill
 
04:06:05.389 --> 04:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
um I do think that he serves as his well
 
04:06:07.550 --> 04:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
and I felt that his the concerns about
 
04:06:09.830 --> 04:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
the drug court in this need for
 
04:06:13.309 --> 04:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
um the other context the other um
 
04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
um vocational help I I think that the
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders answered that well but uh
 
04:06:19.370 --> 04:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
again I think that it's heightened their
 
04:06:22.670 --> 04:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
sensitivity to the need for that so um I
 
04:06:26.450 --> 04:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:28.610 --> 04:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
any other discussion this is on House
 
04:06:32.750 --> 04:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 569 and on the motion of uh
 
04:06:37.250 --> 04:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:40.309 --> 04:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
seeing none call upon the clerk to draw
 
04:06:42.830 --> 04:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
the role again this is on the motion of
 
04:06:42.840 --> 04:06:49.550 align:start position:0%
the role again this is on the motion of
IPL

04:06:49.550 --> 04:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:49.560 --> 04:06:52.790 align:start position:0%

04:07:39.309 --> 04:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:39.319 --> 04:07:40.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:07:40.910 --> 04:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:07:44.229 --> 04:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:47.870 --> 04:07:47.880 align:start position:0%

representative

04:07:49.729 --> 04:07:49.739 align:start position:0%

04:08:08.929 --> 04:08:08.939 align:start position:0%
no objection to the consent calendar
 
04:08:08.939 --> 04:08:16.130 align:start position:0%
no objection to the consent calendar
nope

04:08:16.130 --> 04:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:18.969 --> 04:08:18.979 align:start position:0%
they uh I think the next
 
04:08:21.889 --> 04:08:21.899 align:start position:0%
bills that I think we can work on would
 
04:08:24.740 --> 04:08:24.750 align:start position:0%
be house bill 584.
 
04:08:24.750 --> 04:08:27.349 align:start position:0%
be house bill 584.
[Applause]

04:08:27.349 --> 04:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
04:08:32.090 --> 04:08:32.100 align:start position:0%

04:08:37.100 --> 04:08:38.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:08:38.750 --> 04:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:38.760 --> 04:08:42.410 align:start position:0%
so
yeah

04:08:42.410 --> 04:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:44.510 --> 04:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
you'd like to I'd like to make a motion
 
04:08:47.809 --> 04:08:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:51.530 --> 04:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:54.889 --> 04:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Birch
 
04:08:56.450 --> 04:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
and would you like to address that
 
04:08:56.460 --> 04:09:01.490 align:start position:0%
and would you like to address that
representative

04:09:01.490 --> 04:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:03.410 --> 04:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
it appears that
 
04:09:07.309 --> 04:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
pass not needed and it could possibly be
 
04:09:10.130 --> 04:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
in violation of the U.S Constitution and
 
04:09:12.290 --> 04:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution
 
04:09:12.300 --> 04:09:15.469 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution
um

04:09:15.469 --> 04:09:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:19.370 --> 04:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
I know that members of the press
 
04:09:19.380 --> 04:09:21.830 align:start position:0%
I know that members of the press
are

04:09:21.830 --> 04:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill
 
04:09:24.600 --> 04:09:26.929 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill
and

04:09:26.929 --> 04:09:26.939 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:31.010 --> 04:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:31.020 --> 04:09:33.550 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:09:33.550 --> 04:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:09:38.290 --> 04:09:38.300 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on House Bill 584
 
04:09:40.849 --> 04:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
yes I think
 
04:09:44.389 --> 04:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
I I think um I think maybe uh when the
 
04:09:46.490 --> 04:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
bill was written they also
 
04:09:49.550 --> 04:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
underestimated uh the ability of media
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
consumers to uh
 
04:09:54.170 --> 04:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
know that the old stories are old
 
04:09:55.790 --> 04:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
stories and there's probably a newer
 
04:09:57.650 --> 04:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
story from you know things have happened
 
04:10:00.110 --> 04:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
since then too like
 
04:10:02.450 --> 04:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
I know I was on the front page of a
 
04:10:03.889 --> 04:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
union leader for doing something stupid
 
04:10:06.769 --> 04:10:06.779 align:start position:0%
about 10 years ago and um
 
04:10:08.689 --> 04:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
actually pretty rare that anybody brings
 
04:10:11.150 --> 04:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
it up but when they do you know I know
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
I've done lots of other things lots of
 
04:10:14.689 --> 04:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
other stupid things and occasionally
 
04:10:16.490 --> 04:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
some not so stupid things since then I
 
04:10:18.710 --> 04:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
think that's the case for most
 
04:10:20.330 --> 04:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
individuals who have old stories about
 
04:10:21.889 --> 04:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
themselves in the newspaper and also of
 
04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
course we want
 
04:10:25.250 --> 04:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
the media to report more more news not
 
04:10:28.729 --> 04:10:28.739 align:start position:0%
less you know so I would
 
04:10:30.830 --> 04:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
and of course I agree it's totally
 
04:10:33.349 --> 04:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional as well so I think
 
04:10:34.300 --> 04:10:34.310 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
04:10:34.310 --> 04:10:35.929 align:start position:0%
that's just

legislate on House Bill 584
 
04:10:56.430 --> 04:10:56.440 align:start position:0%

um I don't think there is anyone on this
 
04:13:43.319 --> 04:13:44.389 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there is anyone on this
committee

04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:13:47.090 --> 04:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
who does not believe
 
04:13:47.100 --> 04:13:48.710 align:start position:0%
who does not believe
that

04:13:48.710 --> 04:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:13:48.720 --> 04:13:50.389 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:13:50.389 --> 04:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:52.990 --> 04:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
uh the way
 
04:13:57.290 --> 04:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
we educate our children in a Democratic
 
04:13:57.300 --> 04:13:58.910 align:start position:0%
we educate our children in a Democratic
Society

04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
Society
 
04:14:03.170 --> 04:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
that's a small D Democratic Society is
 
04:14:03.180 --> 04:14:05.210 align:start position:0%
that's a small D Democratic Society is
essential

04:14:05.210 --> 04:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
essential
 
04:14:05.220 --> 04:14:06.110 align:start position:0%
essential
um

04:14:06.110 --> 04:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:06.120 --> 04:14:07.729 align:start position:0%
um
to

04:14:07.729 --> 04:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:14:12.830 --> 04:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
um our social cultural economic
 
04:14:12.840 --> 04:14:13.510 align:start position:0%
um our social cultural economic
um

04:14:13.510 --> 04:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:16.130 --> 04:14:16.140 align:start position:0%
survival and I don't think there is
 
04:14:16.140 --> 04:14:17.630 align:start position:0%
survival and I don't think there is
anyone

04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
04:14:21.110 --> 04:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
in this committee if certainly speaking
 
04:14:25.070 --> 04:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
for myself who does not believe that we
 
04:14:25.080 --> 04:14:26.110 align:start position:0%
for myself who does not believe that we
haven't

04:14:26.110 --> 04:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily found the absolute best way
 
04:14:34.870 --> 04:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
to provide appropriate educational
 
04:14:38.689 --> 04:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
opportunities for every citizen
 
04:14:42.950 --> 04:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
of this state really from
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
from birth until
 
04:14:45.600 --> 04:14:47.450 align:start position:0%
from birth until
death

04:14:47.450 --> 04:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
death
 
04:14:47.460 --> 04:14:49.189 align:start position:0%
death
um

04:14:49.189 --> 04:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:52.490 --> 04:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
and we recognize the complexity
 
04:14:54.729 --> 04:14:54.739 align:start position:0%
so I have great
 
04:14:58.010 --> 04:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
sympathy for representative lewicki for
 
04:15:02.330 --> 04:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
raising this issue and do not want to
 
04:15:07.130 --> 04:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
say anything in any way to minimize the
 
04:15:10.130 --> 04:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
importance of the issue that he raises
 
04:15:14.090 --> 04:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
but I believe very strongly
 
04:15:16.450 --> 04:15:16.460 align:start position:0%
that the reason we are called
 
04:15:21.469 --> 04:15:21.479 align:start position:0%
Representatives is because we represent
 
04:15:25.370 --> 04:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
all of the people in the state
 
04:15:29.870 --> 04:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
and more than any other state
 
04:15:32.450 --> 04:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
each of us represents
 
04:15:37.070 --> 04:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
a smaller number of people and therefore
 
04:15:40.490 --> 04:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
are at least in theory closer to the
 
04:15:42.349 --> 04:15:42.359 align:start position:0%
people we represent
 
04:15:45.710 --> 04:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
it is because of that that I believe it
 
04:15:48.469 --> 04:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
is important that it is the legislative
 
04:15:48.479 --> 04:15:51.010 align:start position:0%
is important that it is the legislative
body

04:15:51.010 --> 04:15:51.020 align:start position:0%
body
 
04:15:55.910 --> 04:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
that focuses on how to
 
04:15:55.920 --> 04:15:57.469 align:start position:0%
that focuses on how to
shape

04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
shape
 
04:16:01.070 --> 04:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
access to and funding for
 
04:16:05.570 --> 04:16:05.580 align:start position:0%
quality public education for all
 
04:16:09.590 --> 04:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
the courts have acknowledged that again
 
04:16:12.229 --> 04:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
and again in saying that it is the
 
04:16:14.210 --> 04:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
responsibility of
 
04:16:18.650 --> 04:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
the legislature to do that
 
04:16:22.130 --> 04:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
um but they have done it within the
 
04:16:25.929 --> 04:16:25.939 align:start position:0%
context of the Constitution
 
04:16:29.830 --> 04:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
which lays out the underlying
 
04:16:32.870 --> 04:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation
 
04:16:37.729 --> 04:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
for a free and appropriate education for
 
04:16:37.739 --> 04:16:38.809 align:start position:0%
for a free and appropriate education for
everyone

04:16:38.809 --> 04:16:38.819 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
04:16:43.729 --> 04:16:43.739 align:start position:0%
so that the court is saying to us in the
 
04:16:43.739 --> 04:16:45.910 align:start position:0%
so that the court is saying to us in the
legislature

04:16:45.910 --> 04:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:16:49.790 --> 04:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
do your duty and
 
04:16:49.800 --> 04:16:50.630 align:start position:0%
do your duty and
um

04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:53.809 --> 04:16:53.819 align:start position:0%
and I think that is appropriate and I
 
04:16:56.570 --> 04:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
think it's appropriate for us to
 
04:17:00.710 --> 04:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
do our duty and to develop the
 
04:17:04.010 --> 04:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
legislation that could make us all proud
 
04:17:06.769 --> 04:17:06.779 align:start position:0%
of the public education we have in this
 
04:17:09.710 --> 04:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
state I do not think that a house
 
04:17:12.370 --> 04:17:12.380 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution
 
04:17:15.889 --> 04:17:15.899 align:start position:0%
accomplishes any of that I think it is
 
04:17:18.110 --> 04:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
conceivable a constitutional amendment
 
04:17:21.290 --> 04:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
might be the answer it is conceivable
 
04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
that additional legislation might be the
 
04:17:27.849 --> 04:17:27.859 align:start position:0%
answer but a house concurrent resolution
 
04:17:32.210 --> 04:17:32.220 align:start position:0%
does nothing to achieve our shared goals
 
04:17:36.170 --> 04:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
and so with respect for the sponsor
 
04:17:39.229 --> 04:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
um and inviting you to take an
 
04:17:42.349 --> 04:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity in your free time to read
 
04:17:46.309 --> 04:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
the excellent material that former
 
04:17:46.319 --> 04:17:46.990 align:start position:0%
the excellent material that former
um

04:17:46.990 --> 04:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:49.729 --> 04:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
Republican representative Doug Hall
 
04:17:52.490 --> 04:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
shared with all of us
 
04:17:55.490 --> 04:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
um I hope you would join with me in
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
voting itl on this house concurrent
 
04:18:02.150 --> 04:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
resolution thank you Mr chair
 
04:18:03.889 --> 04:18:03.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:18:05.689 --> 04:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon
 
04:18:08.570 --> 04:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
oh thank you very much Mr chair of
 
04:18:12.110 --> 04:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
I just like to add and as our as my
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
fellow rep from Durham knows because he
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
was she has served as the chair of the
 
04:18:18.530 --> 04:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
finance committee we've actually passed
 
04:18:21.050 --> 04:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
um many large related since the
 
04:18:23.809 --> 04:18:23.819 align:start position:0%
Claremont decisions about Educational
 
04:18:26.150 --> 04:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
Funding none of them have been a
 
04:18:27.950 --> 04:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
entirely satisfactory definitive
 
04:18:29.809 --> 04:18:29.819 align:start position:0%
advancer but we actually
 
04:18:32.689 --> 04:18:32.699 align:start position:0%
you know the the law that Educational
 
04:18:34.790 --> 04:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
Funding is um you know there is law
 
04:18:36.889 --> 04:18:36.899 align:start position:0%
about Educational Funding sorry advocacy
 
04:18:38.330 --> 04:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
inform you know the rest of it that
 
04:18:40.969 --> 04:18:40.979 align:start position:0%
actually you know does it does exist in
 
04:18:43.250 --> 04:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
law and then a few weeks we'll be um
 
04:18:44.450 --> 04:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
considering your bill which will
 
04:18:46.189 --> 04:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
probably make changes of that loss so
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
like the whole uh
 
04:18:51.170 --> 04:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
the whole basic premise of the HCR is at
 
04:18:53.330 --> 04:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
least somewhat factually incorrect in my
 
04:18:53.340 --> 04:18:56.990 align:start position:0%
least somewhat factually incorrect in my
opinion

04:18:56.990 --> 04:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:59.450 --> 04:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
that's about as well I'll allowed to add
 
04:19:00.889 --> 04:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
to it so like they're gonna I think
 
04:19:03.050 --> 04:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
Smith said pretty much uh pretty much
 
04:19:05.150 --> 04:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
said it all in my opinion so

04:19:12.840 --> 04:19:14.330 align:start position:0%
um I I do agree with um representative
Smith

04:19:14.330 --> 04:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
04:19:16.910 --> 04:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
um insofar as
 
04:19:19.849 --> 04:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
um in HCR does not uh provide the
 
04:19:22.130 --> 04:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
solution to a problem that
 
04:19:24.889 --> 04:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
um the state uh has to deal in with for
 
04:19:26.030 --> 04:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
a while
 
04:19:28.429 --> 04:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
um I believe that you know education for
 
04:19:30.769 --> 04:19:30.779 align:start position:0%
all is very important whether parental
 
04:19:33.050 --> 04:19:33.060 align:start position:0%
choice is important you know it's the
 
04:19:36.349 --> 04:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
public or public charter schools Etc
 
04:19:38.150 --> 04:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
um but there's other avenues to deal
 
04:19:39.950 --> 04:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
with this issue including
 
04:19:42.530 --> 04:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
um addressing you through a cacr
 
04:19:45.070 --> 04:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
um further actions to the court through
 
04:19:48.469 --> 04:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
different cases and I just believe that
 
04:19:50.269 --> 04:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
there's a separation of powers and the
 
04:19:52.130 --> 04:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
court makes a decision
 
04:19:54.889 --> 04:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
um you know an HCR to come out that
 
04:19:57.170 --> 04:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily move um the move would
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
be to introduce the cacr so I'll be
 
04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
voting itl although I do sympathize with
 
04:20:10.969 --> 04:20:10.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:13.849 --> 04:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
04:20:17.090 --> 04:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry uh Mr chair I just didn't
 
04:20:19.250 --> 04:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
lower my hand
 
04:20:24.740 --> 04:20:24.750 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:24.750 --> 04:20:26.570 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:20:26.570 --> 04:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:20:30.110 --> 04:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
for me it wasn't as much about education
 
04:20:32.809 --> 04:20:32.819 align:start position:0%
as it is about
 
04:20:32.819 --> 04:20:34.250 align:start position:0%
as it is about
the

04:20:34.250 --> 04:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:37.309 --> 04:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
inherent powers of the various bridges
 
04:20:40.729 --> 04:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:42.590 --> 04:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
the argument that we have to do a
 
04:20:44.450 --> 04:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment on the Supreme
 
04:20:44.460 --> 04:20:45.530 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment on the Supreme
Court

04:20:45.530 --> 04:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
Court
 
04:20:48.110 --> 04:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
makes decisions that are egregiously
 
04:20:51.830 --> 04:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
wrong to me it is egregiously
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
we as an independent branch
 
04:20:58.309 --> 04:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
that our own responsibilities to read
 
04:20:58.319 --> 04:20:59.689 align:start position:0%
that our own responsibilities to read
and

04:20:59.689 --> 04:20:59.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:02.450 --> 04:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
follow the Constitution I believe this
 
04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
is CR
 
04:21:06.410 --> 04:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
uel makes that clear
 
04:21:09.290 --> 04:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
ance and despite the fact that the
 
04:21:11.090 --> 04:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
Clermont decision was reached out many
 
04:21:12.349 --> 04:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
we've never complied with it and I don't
 
04:21:16.610 --> 04:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
know that we ever will
 
04:21:19.610 --> 04:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
but beyond that I read dunfile's
 
04:21:19.620 --> 04:21:21.349 align:start position:0%
but beyond that I read dunfile's
testimony

04:21:21.349 --> 04:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:21:23.689 --> 04:21:23.699 align:start position:0%
but every word when I get all done I
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
thought he was for the HCR
 
04:21:29.150 --> 04:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
because in nowhere in any of what he
 
04:21:29.160 --> 04:21:30.170 align:start position:0%
because in nowhere in any of what he
wrote

04:21:30.170 --> 04:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
wrote
 
04:21:34.729 --> 04:21:34.739 align:start position:0%
did he he turned in our history with the
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
state had provided funding
 
04:21:41.210 --> 04:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
there were so many responsibility other
 
04:21:42.950 --> 04:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
than to tell the local municipalities
 
04:21:46.370 --> 04:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
they had to raise some amount of money
 
04:21:46.380 --> 04:21:47.689 align:start position:0%
they had to raise some amount of money
and

04:21:47.689 --> 04:21:47.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:49.910 --> 04:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that the court has the
 
04:21:49.920 --> 04:21:51.769 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that the court has the
authority

04:21:51.769 --> 04:21:51.779 align:start position:0%
authority
 
04:21:54.170 --> 04:21:54.180 align:start position:0%
even under the Constitution
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
to to put the legislature in a position
 
04:21:58.729 --> 04:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
where it must have been things that it
 
04:22:00.710 --> 04:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter that that might hurt his
 
04:22:00.720 --> 04:22:01.610 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter that that might hurt his
mind

04:22:01.610 --> 04:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
mind
 
04:22:05.830 --> 04:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:10.429 --> 04:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:17.570 --> 04:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:19.490 --> 04:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
I guess I
 
04:22:23.929 --> 04:22:23.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:26.570 --> 04:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
scene from somebody that actually was
 
04:22:30.530 --> 04:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
part of the other political time I can I
 
04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
can agree with many findings that are in
 
04:22:34.250 --> 04:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:22:36.830 --> 04:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
you know and getting back to the issue
 
04:22:38.389 --> 04:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
of whether
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
you can interpret or cherish
 
04:22:45.889 --> 04:22:45.899 align:start position:0%
uh at the meeting of the word cherish to
 
04:22:49.429 --> 04:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
require the state that that requires the
 
04:22:51.530 --> 04:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
state to make
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
Financial payments or support and
 
04:22:57.710 --> 04:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
frankly I always felt from the very
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
beginning that that was a stretch on the
 
04:23:01.849 --> 04:23:01.859 align:start position:0%
part of the Court
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
I think if I even if I agree with all
 
04:23:06.349 --> 04:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
the findings it's the conclusion that's
 
04:23:09.410 --> 04:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
really the problem and and that is
 
04:23:12.110 --> 04:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
that the findings of the Court just
 
04:23:14.389 --> 04:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
aren't binding at all on the legislature
 
04:23:16.250 --> 04:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
and that's contrary
 
04:23:19.130 --> 04:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
to the very way we've operated the
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
country for 200 years
 
04:23:25.729 --> 04:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
we from Marbury versus Madison
 
04:23:28.010 --> 04:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
uh going back to when the founding
 
04:23:28.020 --> 04:23:29.210 align:start position:0%
uh going back to when the founding
fathers

04:23:29.210 --> 04:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
fathers
 
04:23:32.570 --> 04:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
we're we're still alive and accepted
 
04:23:35.210 --> 04:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
that as the manner in which we would run
 
04:23:36.229 --> 04:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
our government
 
04:23:37.990 --> 04:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:23:42.050 --> 04:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
to now say we as a legislature just
 
04:23:45.410 --> 04:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
aren't going to accept that uh I I find
 
04:23:45.420 --> 04:23:46.630 align:start position:0%
aren't going to accept that uh I I find
that

04:23:46.630 --> 04:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:23:51.170 --> 04:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
anathema I find it uh hard to accept I
 
04:23:51.180 --> 04:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
anathema I find it uh hard to accept I
just

04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:23:54.290 --> 04:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
seems contrary to everything that we
 
04:23:56.210 --> 04:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
learn in our civics class from the very
 
04:23:58.849 --> 04:23:58.859 align:start position:0%
first day we went to school so
 
04:24:01.729 --> 04:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
