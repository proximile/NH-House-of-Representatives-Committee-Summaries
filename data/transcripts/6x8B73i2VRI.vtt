All right, it being the appointed hour of 9 o'clock, we'll go ahead and open the Jalcar meeting.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,500
I apologize for being the last minute.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:26,000
It was 12 degrees and I was in my outdoor hot tub and I didn't want to get out.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,500
All right, we'll start with the Pledge of Allegiance.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,000
Senator Reardon, would you mind leading us?

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,500

Or do we do a point to the author?

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Sure.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,500
Who do we have that needs to be appointed?

16
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
I'm guessing who do we have?

17
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500

00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500

19
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
What's that?

20
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,500

Yep.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yep.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,500
I'm just looking at the Senate side on the house side.

26
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,000
We've got Erica, Jackie, Carol.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Schmitt.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We'll go ahead and seat Representative Potenza for Senate Innes.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay, that's 10.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Is that all set?

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You okay over there?

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Peter, you good now?

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm fine with whatever you want to do.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Thanks sir.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Peter, you good now?

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm fine with whatever you want to do.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Thanks, sir.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Next up is a consent to calendar and see a motion to approve the consent calendar.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So moved.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,500
It's been moved by Representative Lynn, seconded by Representative Schmidt to approve the content calendar as adopted.

45
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Is any other discussion on a consent calendar?

46
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Seeing none, all those in favor, say aye.

47
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Aye.

48
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
All those opposed nay.

49
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
The ayes have it.

50
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,500
So a couple items on the regular calendar.

51
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,000
We have two items that are pending.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,500
One is a manufactured housing installer standards from a preliminary objection we did.

53
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:51,000
We have not received yet the response, but they don't have they have until next month to be able to respond.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So I anticipate the next 30 days we'll get that.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:12,500
The next item is the dental, the dental examiners board and through agreement, the chair and I, as well as the director agreed to waive the deadline, give them more time till April.

56
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:19,000
They are working on a resolution with the people that were the stakeholders.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So we agreed to waive their deadlines and let them come back at the April meeting to address the whole sedation issue.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I almost said euthanasia.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And I think that was a different thing.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So the sedation issue.

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I almost said euthanasia.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,500
I think that was a different thing.

63
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
So the sedation issue.

64
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,000
Is there any other business?

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
With that, we have nothing else on the other business.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Is there anything else to discuss?

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Representative Leon.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,500
I believe that we're going to have some informational session and some training.

70
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,000
So I don't know if that would fall under other business.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yep.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I just want to make sure we'll step into the training as soon as we're done.

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:33,500
I just want to make sure representatives and senators don't have anything they want to comment on before we go into the training.

74
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Again, the training is going to be talking about, you know, how Jalcar works, you know, what kind of motions we're allowed to make and what we can't make or why we can make the motions, that kind of thing, and what the process looks like.

75
00:05:56,500 --> 00:07:20,000
So if there's no other business i'm going to turn it over to doug and his staff so they can take up the training we need to cancel the continued menu meeting if we want to do that and then we can just adjourn and we can get into the training so obviously we don't need our contingent meeting so i'd obtain a motion to cancel a contingent meeting for this month i'll move move by representative is second by represent representative growth uh all those in favor say aye aye all those opposed nay eyes have it the meeting is canceled that for the contingent meeting and with that we've conducted all of our business and we are adjourned we're going to now have the training with the staff anybody wants to stick around and listen doug how long we expect no more than an hour so considering it was probably one of the the fastest job card meetings we've ever had in about 4 minutes.

76
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,500
Um, should be sticking around for an hour should be within your realm.

77
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:38,000
So everyone is aware that was actually the 1st time in the history of jail car that every item has been on consent.

78
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,500
Not continuing 1 other time when everything got postponed.

79
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
spawned.

80
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Thank you.

81
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Thank you.

82
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Thank you.

83
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Thank you.

84
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Thank you.

85
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Thank you.

86
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Thank you.

87
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Thank you.

88
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Thank you.

89
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Thank you.

90
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Thank you.

91
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Thank you.

92
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Thank you.

93
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Thank you.

94
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Thank you.

95
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Thank you.

96
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Thank you.
